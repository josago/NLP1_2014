</b><b>          I/E. BACKYARD - SUBURBAN HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          POV of a HOME VIDEO CAMERA shooting into the window of
          teenage girl's bedroom.
<b>          
</b>          The door inside opens. In walks JUDY OAKS-KELLEN (18), a
          blond haired, mousy girl, wearing only a T-shirt and panties.
          As she heads to the mirror we hear...
<b>          
</b>          Sound of skin smacking against skin and heavy breathing.
          Whoever operates the camera is definitely CHOAKIN' THE
<b>          GOPHER.
</b><b>          
</b>          Judy combs her hair in the mirror, oblivious.
<b>          
</b>          The camera operator is in a whack off frenzy as he...
<b>          
</b><b>                                CAMERA OPERATOR (O.C.)
</b>                    Oh, mmph.
<b>          
</b>          He's climaxed.
<b>          
</b>          The sounds have stopped, but the tape keeps rolling.    Judy
          stops combing her hair as...
<b>          
</b>          Camera shuts down.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                          CAMERA ON:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - THE TRACK - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Camera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as Judy
          runs laps during her gym class. Judy, again, has no idea
          that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight.
<b>          
</b>          She's tired, sweating profusely, and looks completely
          miserable. She stops running, exhausted, as the other kids
          pass her.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly, a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER (40) walks
          over and begins BERATING Judy. The Gym Teacher's face turns
          red as she spews insults inches away from Judy's face.
<b>          
</b>          We can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is, it's
          cruel, harsh, and very intense. Exhausted and humiliated,
          Judy holds back tears as...
<b>          
</b>          Camera shuts down.
<b>

</b><b>          I/E. JIMMY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD/KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DUSK
</b><b>          
</b>          Late summer evening. Camera Operator wipes dirt from the
          lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as
          he looks at camera. This is the first time we get even a
          glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT (21). His looks are striking, even a
          bit awkward, but not at all unappealing.
<b>          
</b>          He throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles
          his face back to normal. He spins the camera away, pointing
          it at the back of his house.
<b>          
</b>          Through the kitchen window, Jimmy zooms in on his mother
          (JIMMY'S MOM) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new
          millennium suburban housewife clothes. She's on the phone,
          preparing dinner.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)
</b>                    Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing
                    the nasty last night. Thanks for
                    that one. By the way, who the fuck
                    is Nancy?
<b>          
</b>          Camera whips over to JIMMY'S DAD in the LIVING ROOM, well
          dressed, rich looking and fat in his late 40's, watching
          baseball on TV, tired after a long day's work. He drinks
          from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube,
          munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)
</b>                    Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling
                    her friends that you're hung like a
                    light switch.
<b>          
</b>          Dad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch.
          Jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)
</b>                    Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes
                    the reach and... yes! Both balls
                    at the same time! One heck of a
                    double play!
<b>          
</b>          Eyes on the TV, Dad takes his hands out of his pants and
          sniffs them.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)
</b>                    And the sniff to finish it off.
<b>          
</b>          Satisfied, Dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he
          continues to watch TV. We zoom out to see both Mom and Dad,
          each through different windows.

</b><b>          
</b>          Dark and in silhouette, Jimmy flips on the camera by remote.
          It's too dark to see faces or bodies with any detail, but
          Jimmy's clearly having sex with a PROSTITUTE in his bed. She
          is young, black, and looks very much like a prostitute.
<b>          
</b>          As he pounds into her...
<b>

                    Oh yeah baby, I like it.
<b>          
</b>          By remote, Jimmy shuts down the camera.

</b><b>          
</b>          Jimmy's behind   the camera interviewing the Prostitute who
          sits up in his   bed holding the sheets to cover herself. With
          the lights on,   we can see that she's clearly unattractive.
          Jimmy asks his   questions with a gentle confidence.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          She pauses. You can tell she just wants to leave, but is
          toughing it out for the extra fifty bucks.

</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)

</b>          Jimmy hides hidden camera style inside his car in the high
          school parking lot, bleachers in the distance. School is
          letting out as he zooms in on Judy.
<b>          
</b>          She's looking at the ground as she's taunted by a group of
          Other Harassing Teenagers, a tear streaming down the side of
          her cheek.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly, Judy is bashed in the face with a school bag. She
          falls to the ground, then picks up her broken glasses as
          camera zooms out to catch the Girl who hit her (Mean Girl).

          cries. His taunts are biting and as excessive as the Mean
          Girl's, then he dumps a cup of soda on Judy's head as she's
          crying.
<b>          
</b>          Judy screams at the top of her lungs. The group runs off
          laughing. Jimmy whip pans to the Mean Girl as she laughs
          with her friends, then whips pans back to Judy, now on her
          feet, blood running from her nose and onto her white shirt.

</b>          A scene we've seen before. Jimmy is off camera videotaping
          Judy through her bedroom window. We hear him FLOGGIN' THE
          DOLPHIN off screen while Judy combs her hair in the mirror.
          She stops when she hears...
<b>          
</b>          A Grown Man, (45), walks into the doorway of her bedroom.
          This is JUDY'S DAD. He comes in and doesn't say a thing to
          her. Judy doesn't acknowledge him at all and continues
          combing her hair as though he's not even there.
<b>          
</b>          He comes up behind her, then wraps his arms around her,
          giving her a warm hug from behind. Something's not right.
          The masturbation sounds STOP.
<b>          
</b>          Judy's noticeably uncomfortable but doesn't resist as her
          Father begins kissing her neck. His hand slowly creeps down
          to her pelvic area, his other hand turning out the bedroom
          light. The room goes dark.

</b>          Camera flips down, then OFF...

          window, but now it's the distorted, grainy, black and white
          of "Nite Shot" mode. Though we see the Judy's mirror and her
          dresser, she and her Father are nowhere to be found.

</b>          The TV is off. All we see is Judy's back. She hasn't once
          turned around to face the camera during any of the clips.
<b>          
</b>          She sits still.
<b>          
</b>          She trembles but doesn't turn around. She collects herself
          but still doesn't turn around. Jimmy holds the camera
          steady.
<b>          
</b>          Still she doesn't turn around.
<b>          
</b>          She fidgets in her seat but still doesn't turn around.
<b>          
</b>          She now sits still on the edge of the bed like she is in a
          trance, but still doesn't turn around to face the camera.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                   13.

</b>          No movement.
<b>          
</b>          She begins to breath heavily.
<b>          
</b>          Then no movement.
<b>          
</b>          She leans her head down towards the floor.
<b>          
</b>          Then no movement.
<b>          
</b>          Still no movement or any reaction for that matter.   It's like
          she is in a trance and can't wake up.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy (O.C.) continues to roll without budging.
<b>          
</b>          Still no movement.
<b>          
</b>          It looks like she's about to turn around. She moves her head
          in the direction of the camera, then assumes her original
          position facing the TV.
<b>          
</b>          Then... no movement.
<b>          
</b>          Still no movement.
<b>          
</b>          Then Judy collapses onto the bed. Jimmy, still rolling, gets
          off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor
          crying hysterically.
<b>          
</b>          Judy cries and cries and cries and cries. She then lets out
          a cry from the depths of her soul. The cry is long, hard,
          and loud.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera.
<b>          
</b>          She rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into
          the camera. She tries to collect herself.

</b>          Jimmy's behind the camera. He stands at the head of the
          stairs shooting down. Sounds of a dinner party just getting
          started come from downstairs. He walks down the steps into
          the party.
<b>          
</b>          A generic "Happy Twentieth Anniversary" sign hangs above the
          front door. Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style
          studio portrait on the wall. It's Jimmy's parents wearing
          saccharine sweet smiles, Dad's hair slicked back, Mom in an
          overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing.
<b>          
</b>          Gifts sit on the entry-way table. Party Guests are dressed
          nicely and are mingling in the house, drinks in hand. Dinner

</b>          More and more people react with gasps and revulsion at

</b>          The place is full of More Party Guests. Frame moves across a
          huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar. We catch a
          glimpse of Jimmy's image and realize...
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy is completely NAKED and has PAINTED HIS ENTIRE BODY

          from the room.

</b>          Jimmy's Dad runs into the room and throws a blanket over
          Jimmy's head, body and the camera. All we see is black and
          flashes of light from under the blanket.

</b>          Camera is being removed from the camera bag. As the lens
          pans quickly, we catch a glimpse of Jimmy smirking, holding
          the camera. He's way too close to the lens.
<b>          
</b>          He flips it around until it locks on DR. WALTERS, MFCC (40),
          Jimmy's not very accomplished therapist. Walters seems to
          have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests he's
          the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to. He
          sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office.
          Jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first
          session together.

                       It felt like someone had been
                       reading my mind.
<b>          
</b>          She stops.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 JIMMY

</b><b>                                  JUDY
</b>                       It was like someone had jumped into
                       my head and watched what was being
                       projected.
<b>          
</b>          Now Judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 JIMMY
</b>                       And earlier, what you said about
                       God.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy zooms in the camera by remote.    Judy's distracted.

</b><b>                                 JIMMY

<b>          
</b>          Judy refocuses.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 JUDY
</b>                       I said that it felt like God had
                       sent someone to protect me, and to
                       look out for me.
<b>          
</b>          She looks at Jimmy as if he is an angel.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 JUDY
</b>                       And I said that you are the only
                       person in my life who has ever
                       looked after me like that.
<b>          
</b>          Judy tries to stifle tears, but they're starting to flow
          again. As camera zooms in further, Judy catches sight of
          Jimmy's finger on the remote and BLOWS HER FUCKING TOP,
          leaping from her chair.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 JUDY

                       crying!
<b>          
</b>          Judy goes for the camera, struggling to get it off the
          tripod, she finally frees it and points it at Jimmy.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                      22.

                    you like having a camera shoved
                    right up your ass?
<b>          
</b>          Camera's framed poorly, moves around a lot, goes in and out

</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)

                    used to it.
<b>          
</b>          Judy moves the camera directly in his face. The lens is
          millimeters away from his nose. We see an extreme close up
          of his nostrils.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY
</b>                    Generally I'd place the camera
                    further away from my nose, but if
                    this is your preferred shooting
                    style then I guess I'll have to
                    adjust to it.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY
</b>                    How's this work for you?
<b>          
</b>          Judy pulls back and continues filming him.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)

</b>          Now Judy's the interviewer.   Her framing is not quite as

</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)

</b><b>                              JIMMY
</b>                    I don't film everything.

</b><b>                              JIMMY
</b>                    Because it's rare that I get to
                    find someone that lets their
                    emotions go. When a person is
                    crying, I mean truly crying, or
                    truly laughing or smiling or
                    frowning or gasping. For a few
                    seconds or minutes I get a chance
                    to see that person's soul. And
                    really, now that you've forced me
                    to think about it. I think it's a
                    very rare and beautiful thing to be
                    afforded that opportunity.
<b>          
</b>          Judy is shaken and speechless.

</b>          Judy's moved and forgets herself.   Camera drops from Jimmy.

</b><b>                                JIMMY
</b>                    Because.

</b>          Jimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and
          turns the interview around.

<b>          
</b>          Judy pauses. The pressure of the camera from Jimmy makes her
          feel like she has to give him more.

                    descent into mid-life crisis.
                    Generally when an only child leaves
                    the nest, the parents begin
                    reassessing their own lives. They
                    see us as a younger, better version
                    of themselves.

                    privacy and insecure because we no
                    longer seek their approval. They
                    used to take us to baseball games
                    and cover our scrapes with
                    bandages, but once we no longer
                    need Mom to nurture our bruises or
                    Dad to be our hero it puts their
                    roles and subsequent sense of self
                    worth into question.

          heavy breathing and the two of them smashing up against the
          interior of the car.

          hands it over.

          places it between her breasts, squishing them together,

</b>          Judy takes the barrel of the gun from her breasts and near
          her mouth. She starts rolling her tongue over the top of the
          barrel slowly and seductively, then stops. It looks as if
          she's about to perform full mock oral sex on the barrel of
          the gun.

<b>          
</b>          After a beat, he reappears. Now he's wearing nothing but a
          sequined teddy. He's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking.
          He sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. Now we see
          that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of
          fishnet stockings. He begins putting them on.
<b>          
</b>          When he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off
          the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. He begins
          to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of
          the hose over his hands and fingertips.
<b>          
</b>          He seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to
          get all worked up. He shakes his hips and dances around the
          room for a few seconds.
<b>          
</b>          Now Jimmy's Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long
          brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. Putting it on,
          with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he
          has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest,
          hairiest, Cher look-a-like.
<b>          
</b>          Someone else enters the room.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          As Jimmy's Mom exits frame, we see Jimmy's Dad go to the
          mirror. He opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a
          little makeup bag.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Mom re-enters, now wearing a mini leather biker's
          hat, carrying a riding switch.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY'S MOM
</b>                    Come on slut.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to
          the bed. By the way Jimmy's parents are behaving, it's as if
          they've gone through this routine a thousand times.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Mom drifts off screen as Jimmy's Dad gets up on all
          fours. Suddenly, we hear a SMACK as Jimmy's Mom hits Jimmy's
          Dad on his ass with the switch.
<b>          
</b>          He lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING
          him with the whip harder and harder. He yelps, squeals, and
          gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the
          air until she stops.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Mom comes back through and out of frame. Jimmy's Dad
          pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while
          he waits for her return.
<b>          
</b>          She comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an
          enormous strap on dildo.
<b>          
</b>          Disappearing out of frame again, Jimmy's Dad gets himself
          ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed.
<b>          
</b>          From behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's
          dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as
          she rips his fishnets off screen.
<b>          
</b>          There's a pause. Nothing seems to be happening, but Jimmy's
          Dad is bracing himself for something. His face tightens up.
          Off screen, Jimmy's Mom has started mounting him from behind.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy can't take it any longer. As he slowly emerges from
          the closet, his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately. She
          jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Camera's shaky but it's easy to guess what's been happening.
          Mom's just started doing Dad from behind with the strap on.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting. He looks
          completely absurd screaming at Jimmy wearing his sequined
          dress and wig.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Mom goes hysterical and begins screaming at Jimmy's

<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Dad is beside himself with fury and throws off his

                    have a nice friendly game of catch.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Dad attacks Jimmy. He swings at the lens. He's one
          angry drag queen daddy. He begins strangling Jimmy.

<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating
          Jimmy's Dad with it.
<b>          
</b>          Judging from the punishment she's inflicting upon her drag
          queen husband, the dildo apparently is made from the finest
          and heaviest of materials.

</b>          Jimmy's Dad lets go.    The dildo's doing the trick.

</b>          Jimmy's Mom keeps swinging the dildo at Jimmy's Dad even
          though he's let go.

<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Mom now directs her attention on Jimmy. She screams
          at him as she swings her gigantic strap on towards the
          camera.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY'S MOM

<b>          
</b>          She continues to swing the strap on as she walks closer and
          closer to the lens.
<b>          
</b>          The camera goes crazy. Loud sounds are heard throughout the
          room. Evidently Jimmy has been tackled. We hear wrestling
          and grunting. It seems that Jimmy's Dad has tackled Jimmy,
          or maybe his Mom, or both, but the camera is too shaky to
          tell just what has happened.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's Dad is still fighting. He seems to have them all
          pinned against the floor. He's crushing his mother.

</b>          We hear Jimmy's Mom screaming/repeating herself. We see a

          all in a wrestling match on the floor.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy with great enthusiasm begins to sing as the camera
          shakes.

<b>          
</b>          The wrestling match continues as we see more hands come
          towards the lens. Jimmy's Mom suddenly stops screaming, as
          if she's been knocked out.

          rattles, but we can definitely tell this is all in good fun.
<b>          
</b>          Judy screams as she is being chased through the woods.   She
          couldn't feel more free.
<b>          
</b>          She begins to tire and slows down. She can no longer run and
          turns towards the camera. As she turns around, camera shows
          her from the waist up. She has a beer can in her hand and
          she is a little drunk.
<b>          
</b>          For the first time, she's completely at ease with her own
          body and looks perfectly natural being naked in the
          wilderness. She walks towards the camera smoothly and
          seductively. Her long hair blond hair blows gently in the
          wind.

                    talking about it in the nut house.
                    That's ALL anybody fucking talked
                    about was this dude who lives up
                    there named Uncle Rodney. He
                    supposedly has a commune where we
                    can do this kind of thing every
                    day.

          open while Judy films through the windshield at the car full

          baseball bat.

                    I was wrong, I know I was wrong and

                    officially diagnose you with

          then opens the top bun of the burger to examine if they got

</b>                    I was thinking, the last time you
                    got out we did it like five times,
                    like as soon as we saw each other,
                    we got naked and started doing it.
                    And today, my parents weren't even
                    home and I tried to do some stuff
                    to you, but you were acting like
                    you weren't interested.

</b><b>                              JUDY
</b>                    Was it because you jerked off so
                    much while you were locked up?
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy hands her a small bottle of whiskey. She takes a
          sizable gulp, makes a face, then hands it back to Jimmy.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)
</b>                    No.
<b>          
</b>          Judy is getting upset again.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY
</b>                        (voice cracking)
                    Then why don't you want to have sex
                    with me Jimmy? You don't think I'm
                    pretty anymore?
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)
</b>                    No, no, no! That has nothing to do
                    with it. After I saw my dad being
                    rammed in the ass by my mother, I
                    kind of blocked it out, but when I
                    was in there they kept talking to
                    me and talking to me about it. Now
                    I can't stop it from coming into my
                    head. Every time I get wood, the
                    instant replay machine in my brain
                    projects this image of my Mom
                    pounding into my Dad.

                    too much of an effort to get in my
                    pants anyhow. You just sort of
                    made your sex face and grabbed my
                    crotch.

</b>          While she is driving she pulls down her tank top and quickly

<b>          
</b>          Judy tries to position her body so her breasts are in frame.
          She begins pushing one up, then sticks out her tongue,
          teasing.

<b>          
</b>          Judy smiles and looks over at the camera. One hand on the
          steering wheel and one on her breast, when...

<b>          
</b>          Judy's in shock. Jimmy puts the camera on the floor of the
          car by the passenger seat. He forgets to turn it off.
<b>          
</b>          All we see is a close up of the floor and Jimmy's feet.

          close.
<b>          
</b>          Judy sounds like she is having a complete nervous breakdown.
          She's crying, but in an extremely nervous and frantic way.

          Dinko who's holding a HUGE HILLBILLY WAD OF CASH in his hand
          and stuffs it into a box of cereal. Jimmy zooms in on the
          cereal box. There's a whole bunch more cash in there.

</b>          Judy wipes powder from her nose, then goes foggy for a split
          second, losing then catching her balance.

</b>          Judy steps into frame. At this point, she's in her bra and
          is dancing like a stripper directly in front of the camera.

</b>          Judy keeps on dancing in her own little world while Dinko
          goes to the door. Judy finishes her bottle of beer. She's
          pretty drunk and cranked out at this point.

          her. He yells back into the living room from the front door.

</b>          Dinko brings in HAZEL,(40), a frightfully thin crank addict.
          She's scared, nervous, and completely strung out, and she
          looks like death. They stand off to the side of the room
          watching Judy dance.

</b>          Judy realizes the woman is in the room and stops dancing.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy zooms in on the woman. Looking closer we see that
          Hazel is in the final stages of her life/addiction. She's
          sweating and her eyes are bugging out of her skull.
<b>

          to get her reaction. Her eyes are locked on the screen.
<b>          
</b>          Judy's face drops. We, on the other hand, are dying to see
          what she's looking at.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy swish pans back to the TV and zooms in tight.   The

</b><b>          
</b>          (From Sc. 37, p. 64) On screen we see something completely
          new. It's a black and white security cam style video image.
          Just as the announcer described, this is the kind of image
          that comes from a video camera that's mounted on the inside
          of a Cop Car. It's static and covered with date/time text,
          etc.
<b>          
</b>          On TV, we finally get a chance to see what transpired when
          Jimmy and Judy were pulled over. Judy is standing outside
          the cop car. The moment she sees it approach, we see her
          freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and
          suspiciously. The cop gets up, gets out of the car and goes
          over to the driver side to talk to Jimmy. After a few
          moments, he summons Jimmy out of the car while Judy waits.
<b>          
</b>          The Cop asks Jimmy to open the trunk. He doesn't have his
          gun drawn, but he is being cautious, one hand on his gun
          holster, the other shining on Jimmy's face with a flashlight.
<b>

                    Go ahead and open it.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy stands by the trunk of the car, but he's not really
          obeying the Cop's commands. He's stalling. The Cop is
          getting suspicious. We can barely hear what they're saying
          to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by.
<b>          
</b>          There's an unintelligible exchange, then... the cop steps
          forward, raising his voice.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          The Cop and Jimmy are sort of at a standoff.    Jimmy finally
          leans over and puts his hands on the trunk.
<b>          
</b>          The Cop comes in close to Jimmy, pulling his hand from his
          gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt.
<b>          
</b>          At that exact moment, Jimmy makes his move, LEAPING for the
          Cop.
<b>          
</b>          He takes the Cop to the ground and off screen.
<b>          
</b>          All we see is a barely decipherable image of Judy freaking
          out in the passenger seat because she can't see what's going
          on and neither can we.
<b>          
</b>          About 5 seconds go by.
<b>          
</b><b>          BOOM!
</b><b>          
</b>          A gunshot is fired.
<b>          
</b>          It feels like an eternity, then...
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy pops up off the ground. He's got the Cop's gun! He
          hesitates, not knowing what to do. He pauses, hesitant, then
          shoots down towards the ground, where the cop is lying out of
          frame.
<b>          
</b>          He runs around the front of the car and into the driver seat.
<b>          
</b>          There's a moment of hesitation as Jimmy and Judy seem to be
          screaming at each other in the car, then...
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy slams on the gas and the car takes off into the
          distance.
<b>

          locked on the TV, her hand over her mouth, frozen, not
          knowing how to react.

</b>          Judy's starting to tear up. She's emotional, conflicted.
          She can't believe he did that for her, but she's also just
          come to the sober realization that he killed a cop in cold
          blood for her.

</b>          A voice catches Judy's attention from the TV. It's an

</b>          In a booth at the motel diner, Judy is filming Jimmy while he
          stuffs a burger into his face.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    You're such a fucking pig when you
                    eat.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy opens his mouth full of food and comes towards camera.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY
</b>                    Aaaaaaaaaahhh!

</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    Gross. That's it. I'm not taking
                    you to the country club, ever!
<b>          
</b>          That didn't quite sit right with him, but he covers it up
          with a mock pout while he chews.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                        (mocking)
                    Awww... I'm sorry. Did I hurt your
                    feelings?
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy won't respond, playful.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    90.

                    I promise.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy looks up smiling.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 JIMMY
</b>                    When?
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    I don't know.
<b>          
</b>          Judy pauses.   Jimmy keeps chewing.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    Thanks for marrying me. You're my
                    prince charming that came and
                    swooped me off me feet.
<b>          
</b>          The irony is thick. Bald, lanky, 21 year old Jimmy with a
          mouth full of food looks like anything but Prince Charming.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    And one day, we're gonna have a
                    house and a white picket fence and
                    a baby. Tell me what you think we
                    should name the baby.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy stops smiling.    She really believes that's going to
          happen one day.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    What's wrong?
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy doesn't want to answer.    While he thinks...
<b>          
</b>          Something out the window distracts him.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    What?
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY
</b>                    Shhhh. Shut up.
                        (grabbing camera)
                    Give it to me.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy whips the camera around to zoom in on what he's looking
          through the window. Finally, we see...
<b>          
</b>          Two Florence County Sheriff's Cars with their lights flashing
          are parked in the parking lot of the cheap motel.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy zooms in on the cops as they get out of their cars.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                     91.

</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)
</b>                    Shhh.
<b>          
</b>          The cops walk up to one of the doors to the motel room.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)
</b>                    Shit.
<b>          
</b>          Four Florence Deputies stand outside the motel room door,
          ready to bust it in and raid the room.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    What?
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy speaks in hushed tones so that others in the diner
          won't hear them.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY (O.C.)
</b>                    They're outside our room.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    Oh God, Jimmy! They know where we
                    are. We're going to get caught!
<b>          
</b>          Florence Deputy #1 knocks on the door, waits a beat, then
          busts it down. Three Florence Deputies move in with their
          guns drawn.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)

</b>                        (to self)
                    Let's go.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy forgets to shut the camera down. He holds it by his
          waist as the two quickly struggle to get the hell out of the
          diner.
<b>          
</b>          Follow along with them, camera by Jimmy's side, mostly
          pointing randomly at the floor of the diner or out the
          window.
<b>          
</b>          They head out the door to the...
<b>          
</b><b>          PARKING LOT
</b><b>          
</b>          Action continues, the camera still rolling without Jimmy
          realizing it. They run at a fast clip along the parking lot
          as they head toward...
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    92.

<b>          
</b>           Jimmy slides into   the driver seat and throws the camera onto
          the dashboard. We    see Jimmy behind the wheel as they drive
          out of the parking   lot. He's in freak-out mode, afraid as
          hell they're going   to be caught by the cops.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)

<b>          
</b><b>                                JIMMY
</b>                    I know.    Just shut up!   Let me
                    think.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy keeps driving, his eyes darting back and forth between
          the road, the rear view mirror and Judy.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY
</b>                    Are they coming?

</b><b>                              JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    I don't know. I don't think so.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy looks back up into the rear view mirror, still not 100%
          satisfied that they're not being chased.
<b>          
</b><b>                               JUDY (O.C.)
</b>                    No.   I don't think they're coming.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's still not certain. He looks for a while. Then he
          sighs. It seems that he knows they're not coming.
<b>          
</b><b>                              JIMMY
</b>                        (relief)

                        (to Judy)
                    That was close.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy drives for a bit, then notices that the camera is on
          and pointing at him. He reaches forward and...
<b>          
</b>          Camera shuts down.
<b>

                    get up little fuck nugget.
<b>          
</b>          Judy opens her eyes.    The first thing she sees is Jimmy
          filming her.
<b>          
</b>          Judy smiles like an infant who sees her daddy for the first
          time after a night's sleep. Judy, very childlike, opens her
          arms for Jimmy to hug her.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy leans over, camera in hand, and gives her a hug. The
          camera shakes and goes out of focus as he's hugging her.

</b>          Judy drives up a gravel road as Jimmy films.    They travel
          through the back roads in Northern Kentucky.    It's nothing
          but woods outside the window.

<b>          
</b>          Judy drives some more.    The camera is bouncing as they drive
          across dirt roads.
<b>          
</b>          Judy tries to maintain her composure, but she can't contain
          herself.

<b>          
</b>          Judy bites her lip and drives.    Slowly, she comes around a
          bend as they arrive at...

</b>                    Oh my God.     Is that it?
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy doesn't say anything. He just keeps the camera trained
          on Judy. By the look on her face, what she's seeing looks
          pretty cool.

</b><b>                              JUDY

<b>          
</b>          Jimmy points the camera through the front windshield. Now we
          see what Judy was seeing... about thirty trailers, all along
          the water's edge.
<b>          
</b>          It looks like a commune for run-away teenagers with crank
          addictions and budding/wannabe drug dealers. The kids are
          throwing a combination party, barbecue, and drug festival.

</b>          Judy doesn't respond. She just drives. Her eyes are
          starting to well up a little bit. She's getting emotional.

          expectations.
<b>          
</b>          Judy keeps driving as we see young people, all more or less
          the same age as Jimmy and Judy. Some live in trailers, some
          in tents. They watch as Jimmy and Judy drive in. Clearly
          new faces are of interest to them.

<b>          
</b>          Out the window, they approach another trailer.      Clearly this
          trailer is more important than the others.
<b>          
</b>          Outside, a dorky looking douche bag type, BUDDY (20's) talks
          to some of the Younger People in intense language. They all

<b>          
</b>          Buddy gives Jimmy a big hug like he was a missed relative or
          an old friend. It's all smiles between the two of them.

          nervous.

<b>          
</b>          Jimmy looks at Buddy, not quite sure what to do with any of
          it. Buddy senses the tension.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Buddy extends the camera, lens forward.   We can see Jimmy's
          puzzled look.

<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's puzzled, but he reaches forward and takes the camera,
          shutting it down.

</b><b>          INT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - UNCLE RODNEY'S TRAILER - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Images of UNCLE RODNEY (50) going in and out of focus as he
          sits on the side of a king sized bed. Scars and tatoos
          litter his arms and neck. His eyes are bit maniacal like
          Charles Manson, but he's able to maintain a stoic, but
          nonetheless dangerous demeanor as Jimmy begins setting up the
          camera.
<b>          
</b>          Like a prison inmate or rabid dog, you get the feeling that
          Uncle Rodney could EXPLODE on you at any second.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy moves the camera around the room so we briefly see the
          interior of the trailer. It's an ELABORATE triple
          combination of a middle eastern harem, sixties psychedelic
          motif, and white trash/junk-yard memorabilia.
<b>          
</b>          JUST OUT OF FRAME we hear a female voice crying softly,
          whimpering. The voice is close, in the room with us, but we
          can't see who's making the sounds. Uncle Rodney ignores it
          completely.
<b>          
</b>          Camera shakes, indicating that Jimmy is exceptionally
          nervous.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 105.

<b>          
</b>          Finally, the camera stops shaking. Jimmy zooms out to a
          medium shot revealing that Uncle Rodney has HAZEL lying next
          to him on the bed with her head on his lap.
<b>          
</b>          Uncle Rodney gently strokes her hair like he's petting a dog.
          Hazel, in the midst of EXTREME withdrawals, cries and
          whimpers like a child, oblivious to Jimmy, the camera, and
          everything else in the world except for Uncle Rodney.
<b>          
</b>          She is so strung out and her cravings are so intense that she
          can barely speak.

</b>          Uncle Rodney's tenderness in dealing with Hazel calms her.

</b><b>                              HAZEL
</b>                    Yes.
<b>          
</b>          Uncle Rodney takes his pinky and dips it into a small plastic
          bag of powder. He then places it to Hazel's nostril.
<b>          
</b>          She quickly snorts the tiny bit off his finger.

                    There you go...
<b>          
</b>          Hazel begins whimpering again.   It wasn't nearly enough to
          satisfy her.

                    in a person. Addiction is pure.
                    Addiction reduces a person to an

                    pure and beautiful in the world
                    than an infant.
<b>          
</b>          He puts his finger to Hazel's nostril again, but this time,
          without any meth on the tip. She snorts with all of her
          might then starts crying. Uncle Rodney is toying with her.

</b><b>                              UNCLE RODNEY
</b>                    Hazel is no longer an adult. She's
                    an infant and I'm the surrogate
                    mother who provides her with much
                    needed breast milk. It's a role
                    that both of us have accepted and
                    embrace.
<b>          
</b>          He leans over and grabs a syringe, already filled, then
          gently holds Hazel's arm and expertly injects the liquid into
          her vein.
<b>          
</b>          Nothing happens for several seconds.
<b>          
</b>          Hazel's breathing accelerates. Suddenly she sits up, her
          eyes go wide. Hazel clinches the bed as if she were riding a

</b><b>          
</b>          Someone (Buddy) is filming a raging party consisting of a lot
          of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones
          Jimmy was interviewing before. It's certainly a weird bunch.
          They all look alike, dress similar, and have the same type of
          crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions.
<b>          
</b>          Most of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers
          while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums.
          They all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be
          allowed.
<b>          
</b>          Camera pans to Jimmy, so we realize that he's not filming.
          Our best guess would be that it's Buddy who's filming. Jimmy
          screams at the camera over the noise of the Bongo drums.

</b>          Buddy's hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit.
          We now see Jimmy see Judy.
<b>          
</b>          She dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of
          other drunk, happily intoxicated teenagers. Say what you
          might about the attendees to the event, this party is a
          FUCKING RAGER and Judy is happy to be the center of
          everyone's attention.
<b>          
</b>          Everyone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums beat
          faster and become more intense. It's an all out jam session.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing
          around Judy. Camera follows him with a zoom as he does.

</b><b>          
</b>          Who knows how much later. Minutes or hours, the party rages
          forward. The camera spins around. The party has reached a
          new level of drunken absurdity. Most of those who are
          dancing are drunk, stoned or both.
<b>          
</b>          In the background, while it's too dark and hectic see
          anything explicit, some of the teenagers are engaged in a
          variety of sexual activity. Some have threesomes. Some are
          probably having oral sex. Still others dance around them in
          the foreground.
<b>          
</b>          Camera zooms in on Uncle Rodney.
<b>          
</b>          Standing just behind him, we see of flash of someone
          recognizable. It's a skinny woman, she looks vaguely
          familiar, but it's hard to get a fix with all the craziness
          going on.
<b>          
</b>          She turns her head to look over at Rodney.
<b>          
</b>          Now we can clearly see that this person is...
<b>          
</b>          HAZEL - with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of
          rolling on crank.
<b>          
</b>          AND she's saying something to Uncle Rodney that's definitely
          pissing him off.
<b>          
</b>          Bodies wipe the frame.
<b>          
</b><b>          JUMP CUT
</b><b>          
</b>          Moments later. Camera catches Judy who hasn't missed a step
          along the way to being a high, drunken mess. The rhythm of
          the drum beats is ever present.
<b>          
</b>          Uncle Rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around
          her shoulder, saying something to her, but we can't hear it
          over the noise. Jimmy approaches and they start talking.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy doesn't notice, but there are about four or five of the
          kids, especially a couple of Rodney's Bigger Guys standing
          not too far behind Uncle Rodney watching the conversation
          intensely.
<b>          
</b>          It's really difficult to put your finger on it exactly, but
          something doesn't seem right here.
<b>          
</b>          Uncle Rodney lets go of Judy and puts his arm around Jimmy.
          With the noise of the drums and the fact that we're zoomed in
          from a distance, we can't hear anything they're saying.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                 111.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Now Uncle Rodney and Jimmy are having a conversation as they
          move towards the camera. Though Jimmy can't see it, we can
          see that Rodney's Bigger Guys, the ones that were standing
          behind Uncle Rodney are now pushing Judy along behind Jimmy
          and Rodney. Though Uncle Rodney seems to be having a very
          light and friendly conversation with Jimmy, we continue to
          get the feeling that something ominous is afoot.
<b>          
</b>          Finally, they approach camera and we can hear them.

</b>          This hits Jimmy like a lead weight. Before he can react at
          all, and before he realizes that anything is happening, Jimmy
          is suddenly thrown into a headlock by Uncle Rodney.

</b>          Jimmy gets kicked again just once. Then suddenly, a barrage
          of kicks come at Jimmy one after the other after the other.
<b>          
</b>          Leaves and grass and dirt and flying feet shoot at Jimmy's
          face as he is kicked and beaten repeatedly.
<b>          
</b>          The process goes on for about thirty excruciating seconds.
<b>          
</b>          We can't tell how much damage has been sustained, but Jimmy's
          not moving. He's either unconscious or dead.
<b>          
</b>          With one last kick, the camera is knocked aside and we don't
          see Jimmy's face anymore.

</b>          Finally there's silence. The camera isn't moving.    It's on

</b>          Suddenly, we see everything, albeit in a weird black and
          white grainy fashion. Jimmy's flipped the camera into Nite
          Shot, using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see
          in the complete darkness. He's strapped the camera to his
          wrist.
<b>          
</b>          The image is Jimmy's POV as he searches through his trunk for
          something. Pulling aside a duffle bag, we see the 9mm pistol
          that Jimmy stole from the Cop. He grabs it as camera shuts
          down.

</b><b>          
</b>          By the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy
          took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens
          of drunken/passed out teenagers lying on the ground in
          sleeping bags and in tents.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera.
<b>          
</b>          He sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag   with her
          back turned to the camera. Her hair is identical to    Judy's,
          but we can't see her face. Jimmy quietly steps over    passed
          out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken   anyone.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes
          a loud clanking sound of glass on glass.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking
          up. No one does.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE JUDY.
<b>          
</b>          Kneeling directly in front of her, Jimmy puts his hands on
          her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the
          camera. The girl flips over.
<b>          
</b>          It's not Judy. And luckily, the girl is so severely
          intoxicated that she doesn't wake up.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy now makes his way over to a tent. He quietly unzips
          the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the
          inside. Turns out, the person in the tent is just another
          passed out flunky loser. Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of
          the tent.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    115.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for Judy
          among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground.
<b>          
</b>          No luck.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy's not too far from Uncle Rodney's trailer.   He decides
          to make his way up.
<b>          
</b>          He walks, using his Nite Shot to see, through the sea of
          bodies until he gets up to the entrance...
<b>          
</b><b>          OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
</b><b>          
</b>          There's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile
          by the entrance. Jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at
          the glass. He briefly catches his reflection. He looks like
          hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent
          beating.
<b>          
</b>          Moving forward, Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle
          Rodney's trailer. We hear music coming from inside. Very
          slowly and very carefully, Jimmy cracks the front door.
<b>          
</b><b>          INSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
</b><b>          
</b>          It's even darker inside of the trailer, but Jimmy presses
          forward in spite of that fact, still using his Nite Shot to
          see. A boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy is scared shitless.
<b>          
</b>          In the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is Uncle
          Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a
          spooning position. There's no doubt this time.
<b>          
</b>          It's definitely JUDY!
<b>          
</b>          They are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying
          together. Jimmy slowly walks over towards them. Each step
          is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them.
<b>          
</b>          Once Jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he
          stops. He hesitates for a moment. He hasn't prepared
          himself for this particular situation and doesn't know
          exactly what to do.
<b>          
</b>          He continues filming them until he finally musters the
          courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the
          face. Judy remains unconscious/sleeping as Jimmy gently taps
          the side of her cheek. Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder
          and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. Still nothing.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                    116.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          THWACK! An arm comes out of nowhere and grabs Jimmy's poking
          hand. Jimmy has woken up Uncle Rodney!
<b>          
</b>          The camera shakes out of control.   Uncle Rodney screams at
          the top of his lungs:
<b>          
</b><b>                              UNCLE RODNEY

</b>          Intense and furious wrestling ensues as Uncle Rodney flies
          out of frame then, in a split second:
<b>          
</b><b>          BAM!
</b><b>          
</b>          A gunshot goes off. We hear a Uncle Rodney collapse,
          followed by more gun shots. The camera has fallen from
          Jimmy's hand and dangles by the wrist strap. Camera comes to
          rest on...
<b>          
</b><b>          UNCLE RODNEY'S BLOODY FACE
</b><b>          
</b>          Jimmy's shot and killed him.
<b>          
</b>          Outside, footsteps hit the deck.    Buddy opens the door of the
          trailer.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          Three more rounds are fired, hitting Buddy square in the
          chest, knocking him down. Jimmy points the camera at a dead
          Buddy on his back then whip pans it back to Judy in the bed.
          Finally we hear Jimmy speak.

<b>          
</b>          Outside we hear voices of some of Rodney's Other Teens.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy acts fast. Judy has been drugged and is mostly
          unconscious and groggy, but Jimmy picks her up and gets her
          on her feet, shouldering her out the door. Shot continues
          to...

</b>          A DISTANT GUNSHOT FIRES, but we can't see what is going on.

<b>          
</b><b>          PARKING AREA
</b><b>          
</b>          Another DISTANT SHOT, then Jimmy gasps in pain. He's been
          shot, but decides to run, trying to carry a groggy Judy
          anyway. Their car is in sight as we hear guns going off and
          bullets whizzing by them. One hits Dinko's car.
<b>          
</b>          Jimmy opens the door, then places the passed out Judy and the
          camera in the passenger seat, climbs over her, throwing the
          camera into Judy's lap.
<b>          
</b>          We see him scramble to get the key in the ignition as we hear
          a BULLET HIT the driver's door. The car starts, and Jimmy
          throws it into gear, flooring the gas as he speeds away.
