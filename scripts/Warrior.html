          PADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church
          holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other
          PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes.

          Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and
          drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He
          listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight
          bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view,
          Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue-
          collar neighborhood high above the city.

          TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the
          stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter
          coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a
          brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops
          a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the
          approaching night.

          Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off
          the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he
          approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his
          eyes.

          Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile.

          Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a
          long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.

          Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the
          stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a
          fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.
                         
<b>                          TOMMY (CONT'D)

</b>           What? You change brands?
                         
          Paddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not
          drinking? What gives?
                         
<b>                          PADDY

          Paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a
          confused Tommy follows.

          Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is
          clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy
          stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place
          in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen.

          The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes
          off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He
          glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca
          lounge chair.
                         
<b>                          TOMMY

           who can take a punch nowadays.
                         
          Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a
          series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks
          into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old
          wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.

           a drink with him?

          Tommy shrugs. Takes another pull from his bottle and turns
          back to the photos. He takes them in.

          Tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a
          mall photography studio, of a MAN AND WOMAN (late 20s) POSING
          WITH A YOUNG GIRL (2). The man looks like the second boy in
          the other photos. His brother BRENDAN.

          Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of
          the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at
          the bible, then stares hard at Paddy.
                         
<b>                          TOMMY
</b>           So you found God, huh? That's

           was down at the mill forgiving all
           the drunks. Who knew?
                         
          Paddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing.

          Tommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee
          table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND

          An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who
          is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his

          Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of
          Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son.
          Relieved and heartbroken at the same time.

          A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class
          home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run
          about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some
          whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces
          painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY.
                         
          TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like
          a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA.
          She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a
          lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up.

          Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here"
          expression.
                         
<b>                          TESS

          The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents."
          Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with
          gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around.
                         
          Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to
          the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered
          in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.

          Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't
          look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift
          with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera.

          Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage
          starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays
          in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped
          out of the ring.
                         
          A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves.
          He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts
          moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and
          then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick
          to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.

          He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A
          leg kick. Blocked. Tommy snaps his head with a jab. Then he
          does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard
          right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his
          entourage and Colt Boyd.
                         
          Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring.
          Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing
          and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls
          it down, and launches knee after knee into his face.
                         
          Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll,
          striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls
          out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt
          Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against
          the ropes and blasts away.
                         
          Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going
          on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left
          hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS.
                         
          SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The
          entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt
          Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and
          approaches him.

          Brendan pulls into the parking lot of the local strip club. A
          white TENT is set up outside, and the parking lot is
          overflowing with cars. Something big going on.

          Aluminum bleachers are set up around a ring, where TWO
          AMATEUR FIGHTERS go at it under a bank of sodium lights.
          Hundreds of rowdy LOCALS swill beer and BOO lustily when the

          paces in his corner as a cluster of BIKERS cheer him on from
          ringside. An ANNOUNCER walks to the center of the ring with a

          Lo and behold, there's a shirtless Brendan standing in the
          corner of the ring wearing a pair of shorts. On his right
          shoulder, an elaborate TATTOO of the CONLON FAMILY CREST.

          Brendan reaches out to touch gloves with Mike Moore, but his
          opponent snubs him and storms back to his corner. He means
          business. Brendan, looking less sure of himself, retreats to
          his corner.

          The bikers raise hell as the BELL sounds. Moore comes out
          bombing. Brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers, then gets
          caught in the side of the head with a right hand. He stumbles
          back into the ropes and Moore presses into him, swatting at
          him with his huge hands.
                         
          Brendan absorbs the blows, ducks down, grabs Moore by the
          legs, lifts him, and dumps him on the mat with a resounding
          THUD. Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching
          skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts
          raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face
          and body.
                         
          It's a full on ass-whooping going on in there until finally,
          mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture
          of CHEERS from the crowd and BOOS from the bikers.
                         
          A winded Brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his
          head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs
          out of the ring, where a PROMOTER approaches.

          window. An exhausted Brendan takes off his shirt and begins
          washing his badly SWOLLEN FACE. Then the door opens, and Tess

          Brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent

          Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing
          on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for
          a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.

</b>           Tommy Riordan's captured the
           media's attention, but the question
           still remains: who is this guy? And
           more importantly, can he compete in
           this talent pool? Can he win?
                         
<b>           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
</b>           I wish I knew, Bryan. I wish I knew
           who he was, and I've gotta say the
           fact that I don't know is strange.
           In an internet age where there are
           no secrets, this guy is a complete
           mystery. I can't find out anything
           about him. Tommy Riordan is
           officially Google proof.
                         
          Tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and
          focused look on his face. He seems to want nothing to do with
          Paddy. Training is over. It's time to fight.

<b>           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
</b>           The only reason that Tommy is even
           in this tournament is because of a
           video showing him beating up Mad
           Dog Grimes in the gym.
                         
<b>           CALLEN (V.O.)
</b>           But the reason a lot of his fans
           are in the stands is because of
           another video, which is even more
           stunning than the Mad Dog Grimes
           video. Let me describe it for you
           folks for the few who haven't seen
           it, and I don't know anyone who
           hasn't, but Tommy Riordan ripped
           the door off a tank in the heat of
           battle, saving lives in the
           process, and then walked away
           without claiming a medal. He ripped
           the door off a tank!
                         
<b>           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
</b>           Tommy Riordan is a genuine war
           hero, I'm not taking anything away
           from the guy. He's a very, very
           tough guy, Bryan, but the tank

</b>           Tommy Riordan definitely has his
           hands full in his first opponent,
           Francisco Barbosa. Barbosa is
           nothing to scoff at.
                         
<b>           SHERIDAN (V.O.)
</b>           Yeah, he's the real deal. Very
           tough guy. Very high caliber
           fighter. Tommy Riordan came out of
           nowhere, and I imagine he's going
           to disappear just as quickly.

          wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible
          for Tommy, who returns to his corner. Paddy attempts to give

          levels Barbosa with a massive and brutal LEFT HOOK. The
          Brazilian's head snaps sideways, his MOUTHPIECE goes flying,
          and he does a face plant on to the canvas. It's over.

          He staggers around the room, giving a fragmented soliloquy to
          no audience.

          Suddenly the adjoining door swings open. Tommy, hair
          disheveled, looks in and sees Paddy's state. The old man
          thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at Tommy.
                         
<b>                          PADDY (CONT'D)

          Paddy staggers over and gets in Tommy's face, his own face
          blotched and contorted. The old Paddy Conlon revealed. The
          monster from the past.

          There's no anger in Tommy. He simply walks toward the old man
          and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand. As he struggles
          to take it, the Walkman falls to the ground. Faint dialogue
          is heard coming from the earphones.

           For the love of God. We're lost.
                         
          The old man is running out of steam. He begins WEEPING.
                         
<b>                          PADDY (CONT'D)

          Paddy wobbles, tears streaming down his face. Tommy looks at
          him. The first time we've seen anything resembling compassion
          on that relentless face of his. He HUGS his father and pries
          the whiskey bottle from his hand
                         
<b>                          PADDY (CONT'D)

           We'll never make it back.
                         
          Tommy pulls his father back on to the bed. Puts his arms
          around his chest and tries to quiet the old man. It's a
          tender moment, and it seems as if Tommy is only able to
          relate to the brutal, former version of the father he knew.

          Tommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into
          the room. The end of a very long night.

          A bigger, even more bombastic FIREWORKS display than before
          explodes over Atlantic City. If it's possible, the CROWDS on

          Outside Boardwalk Hall, the giant electronic BILLBOARD has a
          new motif. Koba still swings mightily from the side of a
          ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero
          outfit, flies right toward him. On a collision course.
                         
          Mad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him
          down, and below the three of them, in miniature, is Brendan

          Josh Rosenthal calls Brendan and Koba to the center of the

          dispassionate eyes of a killer. Brendan does his best to hold
          his gaze.

          up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba

          cranks the shoulder even more. It's at the breaking point.

          and Brendan, CRACK. Dislocated. Then the HORN ending the
          round.

          Brendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if
          Tommy's alright, but Tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up
          and grabs Brendan around the throat with his one good arm. He
          shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence,
          and it takes Rosenthal and Frank to separate them.
