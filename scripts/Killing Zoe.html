<b>       FADE IN:
</b>
<b>       INT. TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY
</b>
       Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi 
       zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport.

       Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the 
       cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic 
       loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not 
       permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that 
       they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other 
       automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get 
       their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is 
       Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga".

       Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE 
       UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes 
       shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red 
       hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside.

       He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy 
       going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Hotel Mondial.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Le Mondial.  Tres bien.

       He starts driving.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un 
                 moment.  L'autoroute est ferme.  A cause 
                 du 14 Juillet.

       He drives for a while.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 [Do you mind the radio?]

       Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away.  He also 
       looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du 
       Bois.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 [Do you want me to turn the radio off?]

<b>                           ZED
</b>                     (realizing he's being asked a 
                      question)
                 I don't speak French.

       The driver turns around.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                     (in broken English)
                 Ah.  American?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 That's right.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 That's good because I speak a little 
                 English.

       Zed nods.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 I asked if you mind the radio.  Music.  
                 You know.

       Zed shakes his head "no".

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                     (with a smile)
                 Super cool.

       Zed adjusts his watch.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 What time is it?

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Time, time, time.  I don't know.  
                 Daytime.

       Zed forgets the adjustment for now.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Are you in town for business?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 It's a nice hotel.  Your hotel.  Very big 
                 rooms.

       He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Do you know Paris?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I've been here once before.  When I was 
                 younger.

       The cab driver smiles.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Those were the days.

       They drive for a while.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Married?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I beg your pardon?

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Do you have a wife?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No.
                     (then after thinking about it 
                      for a while)
                 Why?

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Well, if you need a wife for the night...
                     (searching for the right words 
                      in French)
                 Une escorte.  Pour vous faire visiter.
                     (then back to his broken 
                      English)
                 For business.  I give you my number.  
                 Very nice girl.  French.  Like when you 
                 were young.

       He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger 
       tightly extended together, then he crosses them.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Know what I mean?

       Zed smiles at this and nods.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 Speaks the language of love.  Take you to 
                 heaven and back.  You just tell me and I 
                 set it up.

       Zed shakes his head and laughs.

<b>                           CAB DRIVER
</b>                 What you laughing at?  You let Moises set 
                 it up.  She treat you right.  She treat 
                 you fine.

       Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.

<b>                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>       INT. HOTEL - HALL - DAY
</b>
       A long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel.  From 
       around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag.

       Zed is right behind him.

       They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.

<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
       The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed, 
       walks into the room.

       He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and 
       proceeds to show him the room.

       Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                     (in broken English)
                 Your package...It arrived in the last 
                 night of before last night.

       He points to the telephone.

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                 Ah...telephone, for the room service.

       He motions toward the bathroom.

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                 The toilet.

       He opens the closet door.

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                 To hang the clothes.

       He points to a control console next to the bed.

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                 From here you can operate the television.

       Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.

       Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, 
       he starts fingering through it.

       Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which 
       bills to give him.

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                     (after getting what he wanted)
                 Merci.

       He starts to leave.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Oh, wait.

       The bellboy turns around.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 What time is it?

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                     (confused)
                 What time is it?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                     (pointing at his watch)
                 Time.

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                 Ah.  Yes.  Il est presque huit heures 
                 moins dix.

       The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door.

       Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, 
       and takes a seat on the bed.

       Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit 
       and lays back on the bed next to the package.  Before he 
       dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on 
       the bedside table.

       He is asleep.

<b>                                                     FADE TO BLACK:
</b>
<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY
</b>
       Zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in.  
       Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package.  Inside 
       of it is a black steel briefcase.

       The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it.

       On the bedside table we see Zed's watch.  It reads 12:10 P.M.  
       Next to it is the phone.  Next to the phone is a piece of 
       folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads:  
<b>       45.63.53.37.
</b>
<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY
</b>
       Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his 
       face and cascade down his body.

       He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits 
       some out with a spurt.

       Then he stops, attentive, listening for something.

       He turns the shower off.

       Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.

<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
       Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower.  He makes his 
       way toward the knocking.

<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
       Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped 
       around his waist.  He opens it.

       In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than 
       twenty.  She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but 
       she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Bonjour.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                     (a little awkwardly)
                 Bonjour.

       Zed opens up the door and lets her in.  She checks out the 
       room and places her bag on the bed.  Then she makes her way 
       to the window for a view of the city.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Wow.  Vous avez une belle chambre.  Je ne 
                 suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.

       She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to 
       examine every detail of the room.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure.  Toute la 
                 nuit pour 700.  D'avance.  Et faudra 
                 porter un--

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I...don't speak French.

       She blows a bubble.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 It's okay.

       She takes a seat on the bed.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 It will be one thousand francs for all 
                 night.  In advance.

       Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 We can do it now if you want.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well, let me just dry up.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Okay, but it's not necessary.

       He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself.

       She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the 
       television from the remote console.  A French talk show comes 
       on.  She changes the channel until she comes to a station 
       playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu".  She 
       smiles and sits back to watch.

<b>                           ZED(O.S.)
</b>                     (from the bathroom)
                 What's your name?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Zoe or Zoey.  Which ever you like.

<b>                           ZED(O.S.)
</b>                 My name's Zed.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                     (smiling at this)
                 That's funny.  We both have Z names.

       Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair.  His 
       pants are on.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 What was that?

       She notices his pants.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 You can take those off.  The pants.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I'd rather watch you get undressed first.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                     (matter-of-factly)
                 Alright.

       She stands up and starts to lift her top off.  He stops her.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Slower.

       He lays down on the bed.

       She stands there looking at him and then smiles.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Alright Mister America.  Zed.

       Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she 
       slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her 
       eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Slow enough for you?

       Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the 
       bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants.

       She removes the pants and climbs on top of him.  They begin 
       to make love.

       On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays.

       Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't 
       resist during a moment of passion.

       She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp.  An IMAGE 
       overcomes her mind.

       They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both 
       satisfied.

       She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 C'etait formidable.

       She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten.

       They rest there for a while...holding each other.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 I'm cold.

       She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Zed?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Yes?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Moises told me you were in town for 
                 business.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 What kind of business?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Why?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 I don't know.  I'm just curious.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Do you ask all your clients questions?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 No.  Just the ones I like.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 So you like me?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Why?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Because you're...a good person.  I run 
                 into some real creeps.  You know.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 How do you know I'm a good person?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Body language.  We fit together.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 All men and women fit together.  Hell, 
                 even some men fit together.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 No, but you know, we clicked.  You made 
                 me orgasm.  Do you know how often I 
                 orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No I don't.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Usually never.  They're almost always fat 
                 like pigs.

       Zed laughs at this.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 And you make me feel safe.  That's 
                 something more important than the orgasm.  
                 An integral part maybe of the orgasm.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I never really thought of it like that.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Well, it's true.

       Zed nods at this.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Turn off the television.

       Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like 
                 you very much.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well, I like you too Zoe.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Honest?

       He nods.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Why?  For the same reason?  Any man can 
                 orgasm.  Even with his own hand.

       Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well, I like your honesty.  You're open.  
                 Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.

       She doesn't like the sound of this.  She slaps him.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 I am not a prostitute!

       Zed is a little surprised at this.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Really?  Can I have my francs back then?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 I'm a student.  And to pay for the 
                 classes I became an escort.  It's my 
                 choice to sleep with you.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I see.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 What?  You don't understand.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No, I do.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Hey, it's not easy.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I didn't say it was.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 I'm here because I want to.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Okay, okay relax.  What school do you go 
                 to?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 The Centre du Art, Paris.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 That's really interesting.  What kind of 
                 art do you study?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Not any of the old shit.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Oh.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 I have a day job too.  Three times a 
                 week.

       She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as 
       she talks to Zed.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 But someday there will be only my art.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 What kind of things do you paint?

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 I don't paint.  I make things.  Objects.  
                 Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with 
                 no narrative.  I want when someone looks 
                 at one of my objects for there to be no 
                 reference to the world.  Void of feeling, 
                 emotion...void of destiny.  Those are 
                 left for me.  They belong only to me.  If 
                 someone else can see into it...then it is 
                 no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I 
                 would destroy it.  I don't care how much 
                 cash they would offer me.  It would be 
                 shit.  I can't tell you how many objects 
                 of mine have been destroyed.  They told 
                 too much about me.  And if someone wants 
                 to know something about me...I'll tell 
                 them myself.  The way I'm telling you.

       She looks back at him.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 What I do I do only for the objects.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I'd like to see one of these.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 What?  So you could see the work of a 
                 whore?

       He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Zoey.  I'm sorry for calling you a 
                 prostitute.  I didn't understand the 
                 difference.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 The difference is a prostitute would have 
                 lied to you about her orgasm.

       He gives her a kiss.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 If these things you make are as true as 
                 you are...I'm sure they're as 
                 indescribable.  Perhaps, someday, you'll 
                 make one...about me.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 If I do...you'll never know which one it 
                 is.  Because I'll be the only one who 
                 understands.  I'll be the only one who 
                 can look into it and see where in my life 
                 it came from.

       Zed is unable to speak.  They look into each others eyes for 
       a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in 
       through the window.  Then she leans forward and gives him a 
       soft understanding kiss.

<b>                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>       INT. ZED'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       Zed is asleep.  Zoey is asleep in his arms.

       There is a knocking at the door.

       Zed opens his eyes.

       The knock becomes a pound.

       Zed gets up and puts on his pants.  Zoey gets up and looks 
       around.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                     (groggily)
                 What time is it?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I have no idea.  Night time.

       There is more pounding on the door.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 I'm going to take a shower.

       She trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower.

       Zed walks over to the door and opens it up.

       Standing in the hall is Eric, a Frenchman of Zed's age 
       wearing baggy French-style clothes.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (with a thick accent)
                 Hey you madman!

       Zed's happy to see him.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Eric.  Come in.

       They hug.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 What happened to you?  I thought you were 
                 going to call.

       Eric walks in and starts to notice the traces of wild love 
       making around the room.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (smiling)
                 Oh I see.  You have been busy.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a 
                 wake up call.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 That's good, but now I am here.  So let's 
                 go.  We have a lot to talk about.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 What about the girl?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Is she your girlfriend?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Fuck her.

       He peeks into the bathroom.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 She's a dishrag whore.  Kick her out.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I'll let her stay here tonight.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Don't be silly.  It's dangerous.

       Eric walks into the bathroom.

<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       Eric walks up to the shower and knocks on the door.  Zoey is 
       obviously surprised to see him.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (in French with English 
                      subtitles)
                 [Okay.  Get out of the shower.  It's time 
                 for you to leave.]

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 [Fuck you.]

       Eric opens up the door and yanks her out of the shower.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 [No.  Come on you fucking slut!]

       She shrieks.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 [Let go of me you shit!!]

       He drags her out into the room, she is dripping wet.

<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       Zed can't believe this.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Eric.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (to Zed)
                 Don't worry about her.
                     (to Zoey in French)
                 [Why don't you just go back to your pimp 
                 and suck his black dick!]

       She bites his hand.  He yells in pain.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 God damn it!

       He kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 [Get the fuck out of here you fucking 
                 whore!]

       He opens the door and throws her into the hall.

<b>       INT. HOTEL - HALL - NIGHT
</b>
       Naked, Zoey falls into the hall.

       Eric slams the door shut.

       She is instantly back on her feet and screaming as she pounds 
       on the door.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 [Give me my clothes you asshole!]

<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

       She is pounding on the door.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (looking at his hand wound)
                 God damn it.  Look at my hand.

<b>                           ZED

                 Jesus Eric.

<b>                           ZOEY(O.S.)

       Eric listens.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Oh shit.  Her clothes.

       He picks up her clothes and her bag, opens the door, and 
       throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at 
       him.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                     (almost too quick to

                 Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 La ferme!

       He slams the door shut.

       Then he turns to Zed.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 So tell me, what have you been up to?

       Zed sits down on the bed.

<b>                           ZOEY(O.S.)
</b>                 Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux!

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Eric, I liked that girl.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Oh.  Well, then why didn't you stop me.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Because you were on a rampage.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Look, your whole life you've done nothing 
                 but fuck whores.  A girl like that will 
                 give you AIDS.  Why don't you find a nice 
                 girl in the suburbs?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Because when you need to get off you 
                 don't want to have to date for months to 
                 do it.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Just use your hand like me.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Sometimes you just need honesty...and 
                 security.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 I don't understand.  Anyway, it's too 
                 late.  Get dressed, let's go out and meet 
                 the boys.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Okay, let me take a shower.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 No, in Paris it's good to smell like 
                 you've been fucking.  It will make them 
                 respect you.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Oh.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.

       Zed starts to get dressed

<b>       EXT. BOULEVARD SAINT MICHEL - NIGHT
</b>
       The McDonalds on the corner of Boulevard Saint Michel and Rue 
       Soufflot is bustling.

       Eric's Citroen screeches around the corner on it's way past 
       the Pantheon and into the heart of the fifth Arrondissment.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

       Eric and Zed are driving through the streets of Paris in 
       Eric's car.  The grooving Ryuichi Sakamoto song "Triste" is 
       playing on the radio.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - OUTER STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
       Eric and Zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where 
       Eric's flat is.  On the top landing there is a dead cat 
       laying.  Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the 
       door.

       There is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 The people next door are on holiday.  We 
                 took their phone.  If you want to make a 
                 long distance call, go ahead.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Is that cat dead?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 I don't know.  I think it's asleep but 
                 it's been there for days.

       Eric gives it a kick.  No response.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 I guess it is dead.

       They walk into the flat.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a 
       connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back.  In the 
       front of the living room there is a small balcony where the 
       sounds of the city pour in.  The room itself is a general 
       mess.  A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.  
       Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" 
       poster.

       Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.

       Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  FRANCOIS, 
       RICARDO, and JEAN.

       Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE 
       and OLIVER.

       They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Hello.

       They all return the greeting.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (to Zed)
                 Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean,

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I will.

<b>                           ERIC

                 Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au 
                 plus grand perceur de coffres.

       Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                     (with an English accent)
                 Zed, would you like a beer?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Thanks.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Don't think of it.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                     (to Zed)
                 Come.  Sit down.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
       The kitchen is an absolute pig stye.  Dishes are piled up in 
       the sink and on the counter.

       Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties 
       it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer 
       into the glass.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.

       Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam 
       costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto 
       his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.

       Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                     (to Zed)
                 Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to 
                 claim you.

       Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto 
       Claude's shoulder.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 Let me introduce you properly.  This is 
                 Enrique.

       The monkey screeches.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we 
                 don't always get what we like...do we?

       Again, the hideous creature screeches.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                     (to Enrique)
                 Tais-toi!
                     (then to Zed)
                 Do you like hash?

       Then Eric interrupts.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (jokingly)
                 Don't sit next to that junkie.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 Ahhhhhh!

       Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a 
       mass of sparks.  They laugh.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (to Claude)
                 That little shit monkey of yours pissed 
                 on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time 
                 he's out the door.
                     (to Zed)
                 Zed, come here.

       Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way 
       Oliver hands him the glass of beer.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Here you go mate.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Thanks.

       Oliver sits down next to Claude.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       Eric's bed has probably never been made.  In fact, this room 
       looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment.  But, 
       there is a certain order to all this chaos.  Eric pulls out a 
       blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Don't ask me where we got this.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Okay.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 On Bastille Day, all the banks are 
                 closed.

       He places his hand on the blueprint.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 But this one.  BIP.  The Banque 
                 Internationale de Paris.  And for being 
                 greedy capitalists perhaps they will 
                 remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes?

       Zed smiles.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 We will go in and shut the bank down.  
                 Now, look at this.

       Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 As you can see, only one person can start 
                 the alarm.
                     (he hands it to Zed)
                 The concierge, at this desk.
                     (he points it out on the 
                      blueprint)
                 We will take care of him.  Then we can 
                 close the bank.  No one will know the 
                 difference since every other bank will be 
                 closed.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                     (turning the schematic around)
                 Are you sure he won't push the alarm?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Ahhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd 
                 have to be totally incompetent not to 
                 stop him.  Don't worry about that.

       He points to the main floor vault.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Here.  This is where they keep the days 
                 reserve cash.  Okay fuck that.

       He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 There are many vaults downstairs, but 
                 this is the vault we must get into.  This

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 What kind of vault is that?

       He checks the blueprint.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Ah...Swiss made.  A Caliber.

<b>                           ZED

                     (he thinks about it)
                 It'll take three hours.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 No, that's too long.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 That's how long it'll take.

<b>                           ERIC

                 in and out.
                     (he snaps his fingers)
                 Like that.  Or there will be suspicion.  
                 A little time is okay...but too long 
                 and...

       He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well hold on a second.
                     (pointing to the blueprint)
                 What's this?

       Eric looks down at the blueprint.  There is a small passage 
       connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Another vault.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No this.

       Eric looks closely at the blueprint.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 I don't know...it connects the two 
                 vaults.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well, what kind of vault is this other 
                 one?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (reading the blueprint)
                 Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Why would those two vaults be connected?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 I don't know.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Because I can get into this vault in half 
                 an hour.  Maybe less.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 But this entry way is too small to get 
                 the platen out.  We have a lot of 
                 merchandise in there.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No, don't you see?  We get in through 
                 this secondary vault and take this 
                 passage to the other main vault.  From 
                 the inside I could open the Caliber vault 
                 in five minutes.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 You could open it in five minutes?

<b>                           ZED

<b>                           ZED

       EXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin.

       The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon 
       squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled 
       around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.

                 Enterprise as a metaphor for the human 
                 brain.

       No one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a 
       lighter and cooks it to a boil.

</b>                     (continuing)
                 It's really quite brilliant you know.  
                 That's why Star Trek is and always will 
                 be a hit show.

       Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture.

</b>                     (to Oliver)
                 [Here, shut up and hold this.]

       He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the 
       cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.

       Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 [Don't want to get air bubbles in my

       They all laugh at this.

       In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and 
       Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean 
       is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small 
       picture.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                 Do you want heroin?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.

       Jean and Claude laugh at this.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                 No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a 
                 beer...and you're just right.

       Jean snorts a line.

       Claude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head "no".

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 Okay.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                     (recovering from the snort)
                 That's good.

       Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen 
       laughing.

       Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite 
       Zed.  Francois sits on the floor.

       Eric rolls up his sleeve.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (to Ricardo in French)
                 [Hold my arm.]
                     (then to Zed)
                 My vein is like a rock.

       Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the 
       needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes 
       with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the 
       syringe, then all the way back in.

       He withdraws the needle.

       Ricardo lets go of his arm.

       Eric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He 
       looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.

       Then Jean takes another snort.

       Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting 
       up, and drinking more beer.

       Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some 
       heroin in it.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                     (to Zed)
                 Try some.  It's called chasing the 
                 dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it 
                 for centuries.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I don't think so.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                 Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel 
                 as though the rest of the world is in a 
                 bubble of glass and that you're rubbing 
                 up against it like a bad windshield 
                 wiper.

       They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to 
       his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a 
       lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon 
       of smoke.

       Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...

       Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris 
       weaving in and out of traffic.  Next to him is Oliver, and in 
       the back seat is Zed and Eric.  They're giving the very 
       stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights.

       A car speeds up next to them.  In it is Francois, and Claude, 
       with Jean driving.  They are racing with Ricardo through the 
       streets.

       The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting 
       away on the radio.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 There.  That's Notre Dame.

       But before Zed can even look it has past by.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 Do you like French cars?

       All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 
       kilometers per hour.  He tries to calculate what that is in 
       miles per hour.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                     (answering Enrique's question)
                 Yes.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to 
                 seventy-five.  Very nice.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.

       Zed is in too much of a blur.  He leans over to Eric.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Is tomorrow really Bastille day?

                 French history.  And spend the rest of 
                 our lives in Monte Carlo.

       The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers.

       Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it

</b>                 [Faster, faster...go faster.  Let's beat

       Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke.

       Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and 
       cuts off Ricardo.

       Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric.

       No, Zed doesn't see.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (into Zed's ear)
                 This is good to have you here.  We could 
                 not do this without you.

       Zed nods.

</b>                 Everyone has agreed to give you double

<b>       INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
</b>
       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are 
       all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.  
       Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.

       An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.  
       Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables 
       scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for 
       great acoustics.

<b>       ON STAGE
</b>
       a BAND is playing away.  In the audience sit about TWELVE 
       FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.

<b>       AT THE BUFFET
</b>
       In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been 
       set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it.  Behind the 
       tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and 
<b>       JOSEPHINE.
</b>
       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk 
       in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle 
       and Josephine.

       Eric hands them some money.

<b>       ZED'S TABLE
</b>
       Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club.  
       Oliver sits next to Zed.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 So, how long have you known Eric?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well, Eric's mother is American.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Yeah, and his dad's French.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 They're divorced.  And she and his father 
                 had some kind of six month split plan set 
                 up.  So every six months he would come 
                 back to the states.  We were best 
                 friends.  Eventually he and his mother 
                 had a falling out and he stayed here.  
                 It's been...years.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Well, it's good to have you here.  Eric 
                 speaks fairly highly of you.  Say, he 
                 says you're a big fan of Viking films.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well...I suppose.  I used to be, when I 
                 was young.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Oh they're the best.  Helmets with horns 
                 on them.  Shit.  That's fucking genius.

       He starts laughing.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 How 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it?

       Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Yeah...I guess.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 I love it.  It's really good, you know?  
                 Like real music.  It has a heart and 
                 culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz 
                 for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.  
                 Total purity of essence.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Yeah.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Hungry cannibals'd like it.

       Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle 
       of red wine.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 Here, you must drink some of this wine, 
                 it's good.

       He pours Zed a glass.

       Oliver passes on the wine.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                     (to Claude)

                 The fucking English.

       Zed sips some.  He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's 
       good or not.

<b>       ON STAGE
</b>
       Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.  
       The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a 
       delirium of music.

       The band stands up.

<b>       IN THE AUDIENCE
</b>
       The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats 
       then right in front of everything.

<b>       ZED'S TABLE

       Suddenly, Zed notices something...

<b>       ON STAGE
</b>
       Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the 
       band.

       Zed blinks but it's true.

       Oliver and Claude start laughing.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Look at him.  He's crazy.

<b>       ON STAGE
</b>
       And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up 
       with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.

       Eric is all smile as he plays with them.  Sweat is running 
       down his face but he's caught up in the moment.

       ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the 
       stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like 
       James Brown.

       Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back 
       to a musician.

       The set is over.

       Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, 
       Claude, and Zed are sitting.

       laying.  Zed and Eric notice the cat as Eric is opening the

                 it's been there for days.

       Eric gives it a kick.  No response.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 I guess it is dead.

       They walk into the flat.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       Eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a 
       connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back.  In the 
       front of the living room there is a small balcony where the 
       sounds of the city pour in.  The room itself is a general 
       mess.  A bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor.  
       Hung up on the wall is a huge, French "Dressed To Kill" 
       poster.

       Some Brazilian Gilberto/Getz music is playing.

       Sitting at the table playing cards are three men:  FRANCOIS, 
       RICARDO, and JEAN.

       Sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is CLAUDE 
       and OLIVER.

       They all turn as Zed and Eric walk in.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Hello.

       They all return the greeting.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (to Zed)
                 Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, 
                 Oliver, and Claude.  Got it?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I will.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 They all know who you are.
                     (to the rest of them)
                 Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au 
                 plus grand perceur de coffres.

       Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                     (with an English accent)
                 Zed, would you like a beer?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Thanks.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Don't think of it.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                     (to Zed)
                 Come.  Sit down.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
       The kitchen is an absolute pig stye.  Dishes are piled up in 
       the sink and on the counter.

       Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties 
       it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer 
       into the glass.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude.

       Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam 
       costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto 
       his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes.

       Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                     (to Zed)
                 Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to 
                 claim you.

       Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto 
       Claude's shoulder.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 Let me introduce you properly.  This is 
                 Enrique.

       The monkey screeches.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we 
                 don't always get what we like...do we?

       Again, the hideous creature screeches.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                     (to Enrique)
                 Tais-toi!
                     (then to Zed)
                 Do you like hash?

       Then Eric interrupts.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (jokingly)
                 Don't sit next to that junkie.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 Ahhhhhh!

       Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a 
       mass of sparks.  They laugh.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (to Claude)
                 That little shit monkey of yours pissed 
                 on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time 
                 he's out the door.
                     (to Zed)
                 Zed, come here.

       Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way 
       Oliver hands him the glass of beer.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Here you go mate.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Thanks.

       Oliver sits down next to Claude.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       Eric's bed has probably never been made.  In fact, this room 
       looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment.  But, 
       there is a certain order to all this chaos.  Eric pulls out a 
       blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Don't ask me where we got this.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Okay.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 On Bastille Day, all the banks are 
                 closed.

       He places his hand on the blueprint.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 But this one.  BIP.  The Banque 
                 Internationale de Paris.  And for being 
                 greedy capitalists perhaps they will 
                 remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes?

       Zed smiles.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 We will go in and shut the bank down.  
                 Now, look at this.

       Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 As you can see, only one person can start 
                 the alarm.
                     (he hands it to Zed)
                 The concierge, at this desk.
                     (he points it out on the 
                      blueprint)
                 We will take care of him.  Then we can 
                 close the bank.  No one will know the 
                 difference since every other bank will be 
                 closed.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                     (turning the schematic around)
                 Are you sure he won't push the alarm?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Ahhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd 
                 have to be totally incompetent not to 
                 stop him.  Don't worry about that.

       He points to the main floor vault.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Here.  This is where they keep the days 
                 reserve cash.  Okay fuck that.

       He flips the page to the lower level blueprint.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 There are many vaults downstairs, but 
                 this is the vault we must get into.  This

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 What kind of vault is that?

       He checks the blueprint.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Ah...Swiss made.  A Caliber.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Caliber?
                     (he thinks about it)
                 It'll take three hours.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 No, that's too long.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 That's how long it'll take.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Well shit.  It's too long.  We have to be 
                 in and out.
                     (he snaps his fingers)
                 Like that.  Or there will be suspicion.  
                 A little time is okay...but too long 
                 and...

       He shrugs his shoulders in an "I don't know gesture."

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well hold on a second.
                     (pointing to the blueprint)
                 What's this?

       Eric looks down at the blueprint.  There is a small passage 
       connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Another vault.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No this.

       Eric looks closely at the blueprint.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 I don't know...it connects the two 
                 vaults.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well, what kind of vault is this other 
                 one?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (reading the blueprint)
                 Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Why would those two vaults be connected?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 I don't know.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Because I can get into this vault in half 
                 an hour.  Maybe less.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 But this entry way is too small to get 
                 the platen out.  We have a lot of 
                 merchandise in there.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No, don't you see?  We get in through 
                 this secondary vault and take this 
                 passage to the other main vault.  From 
                 the inside I could open the Caliber vault 
                 in five minutes.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 You could open it in five minutes?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 From the inside it's easy.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (excited)
                 Hot damn.  That is our answer.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Okay.  When is Bastille day?

<b>                           ERIC

<b>                           ZED

<b>                           ERIC

<b>                           ZED

<b>       INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       EXTREME CLOSE ON:  Eric making heroin.

       The heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon 
       squeezed into it, then a little bit of tap water.  Huddled 
       around Eric are Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                     (so high he's wobbling)
                 You have to look at the Starship 
                 Enterprise as a metaphor for the human 
                 brain.

       No one is really listening to Oliver.  Eric takes out a 
       lighter and cooks it to a boil.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                     (continuing)
                 Spock is the right hemisphere of the 
                 brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is 
                 the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional.  
                 And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He 
                 drifts between the two.  Back and forth, 
                 as it might be, caught between the two 
                 thought processes.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 [Cotton.]

       Ricardo hands him a cotton ball.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                     (continuing)
                 It's really quite brilliant you know.  
                 That's why Star Trek is and always will 
                 be a hit show.

       Eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (to Oliver)
                 [Here, shut up and hold this.]

       He hands Oliver the spoon and takes out a needle.  Using the 
       cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe.

       Then, he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 [Don't want to get air bubbles in my

       In the meantime, Zed is sitting on the couch with Claude and 
       Jean.  Claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette.  Jean 
       is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small 
       picture.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                 Do you want heroin?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.

       Jean and Claude laugh at this.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                 No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a 
                 beer...and you're just right.

       Jean snorts a line.

       Claude offers Zed the spliff.  Zed shakes his head "no".

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 Okay.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                     (recovering from the snort)
                 That's good.

       Eric, Francois, Ricardo, and Oliver come out of the kitchen 
       laughing.

       Eric, Ricardo, and Oliver take a seat on the couch opposite 
       Zed.  Francois sits on the floor.

       Eric rolls up his sleeve.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (to Ricardo in French)

                     (then to Zed)
                 My vein is like a rock.

       Ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes.  Eric inserts the 
       needle into his vein and draws out a little blood.  It mixes 
       with the heroin, then he pumps it in...then back into the 
       syringe, then all the way back in.

       He withdraws the needle.

       Ricardo lets go of his arm.

       Eric is in bliss.  His eyes roll back into his head.  He 
       looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep.

       Then Jean takes another snort.

       Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting 
       up, and drinking more beer.

       Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some 
       heroin in it.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                     (to Zed)
                 Try some.  It's called chasing the 
                 dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it 
                 for centuries.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I don't think so.

<b>                           JEAN
</b>                 Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel 
                 as though the rest of the world is in a 
                 bubble of glass and that you're rubbing 
                 up against it like a bad windshield 
                 wiper.

       They stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to 
       his face.  They then light the bottom of the foil with a 
       lighter.  Before Zed knows it, he's inhaling a silky ribbon 
       of smoke.

       Suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we...

<b>       INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</b>
       Ricardo is racing Eric's car through the streets of Paris 
       weaving in and out of traffic.  Next to him is Oliver, and in 
       the back seat is Zed and Eric.  They're giving the very 
       stoned Zed a whirlwind tour of the sights.

       A car speeds up next to them.  In it is Francois, and Claude, 
       with Jean driving.  They are racing with Ricardo through the 
       streets.

       The Patrick Hernandez song "Born To Be Alive" is blasting 
       away on the radio.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 There.  That's Notre Dame.

       But before Zed can even look it has past by.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 Do you like French cars?

       All Zed can notice is that the speedometer is at 160 
       kilometers per hour.  He tries to calculate what that is in 
       miles per hour.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                     (answering Enrique's question)
                 Yes.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to 
                 seventy-five.  Very nice.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.

       Zed is in too much of a blur.  He leans over to Eric.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Is tomorrow really Bastille day?

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in 
                 French history.  And spend the rest of 
                 our lives in Monte Carlo.

       The drunken Englishman, Oliver, belches and then cheers.

</b>
       The two cars are franticly racing through traffic.

<b>       INT. JEAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</b>
       Jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it 
       is they're going to.

       Claude, in the seat next to him, gives him some advice.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 [Faster, faster...go faster.  Let's beat

       Francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke.

<b>       EXT. PARIS STREET - NIGHT
</b>
       Jean's car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and 
       cuts off Ricardo.

<b>       INT. ERIC'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</b>
       Ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to Eric.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 [Shit!  That bastard.]

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (to Ricardo)
                 Watch it!  Don't crash my car.

       Eric takes a big hit.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Over here is where the male prostitutes 
                 sell themselves.  Do you see?

       No, Zed doesn't see.

       Suddenly, everyone in the car is shouting out the windows.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                     (out the window)

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 Perverts d'homosexuels!

       Eric laughs.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                     (into Zed's ear)
                 This is good to have you here.  We could 
                 not do this without you.

       Zed nods.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Everyone has agreed to give you double 
                 shares.  That's good.

       Zed nods, delirious.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 You know I have AIDS.  From the needle.

       Zed can't believe this.  He's not sure if what he heard was 
       what he thought he heard.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Really?

       Then Eric sees something.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.

       They take a sharp turn.

<b>       INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
</b>
       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver are 
       all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar.  
       Somewhere crazy Raymond Scott Toy Jazz music is playing.

       An old wine cellar has been converted into a Toy Jazz club.  
       Nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables 
       scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for 
       great acoustics.

<b>       ON STAGE
</b>
       a BAND is playing away.  In the audience sit about TWELVE 
       FRENCH PEOPLE, all enjoying the music.

<b>       AT THE BUFFET
</b>
       In the back of the club near the doors some tables have been 
       set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it.  Behind the 
       tables are two rotund but happy French women MIRELLE and 
<b>       JOSEPHINE.
</b>
       Eric, Zed, Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Claude, and Oliver walk 
       in and immediately start blabbing away in French to Mirelle 
       and Josephine.

       Eric hands them some money.

<b>       ZED'S TABLE
</b>
       Everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club.  
       Oliver sits next to Zed.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 So, how long have you known Eric?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well, Eric's mother is American.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Yeah, and his dad's French.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 They're divorced.  And she and his father 
                 had some kind of six month split plan set 
                 up.  So every six months he would come 
                 back to the states.  We were best 
                 friends.  Eventually he and his mother 
                 had a falling out and he stayed here.  
                 It's been...years.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Well, it's good to have you here.  Eric 
                 speaks fairly highly of you.  Say, he 
                 says you're a big fan of Viking films.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Well...I suppose.  I used to be, when I 
                 was young.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Oh they're the best.  Helmets with horns 
                 on them.  Shit.  That's fucking genius.

       He starts laughing.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 How 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it?

       Zed watches the players on stage and then nods.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Yeah...I guess.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 I love it.  It's really good, you know?  
                 Like real music.  It has a heart and 
                 culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz 
                 for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen.  
                 Total purity of essence.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Yeah.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Hungry cannibals'd like it.

       Then Claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle 
       of red wine.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 Here, you must drink some of this wine, 
                 it's good.

       He pours Zed a glass.

       Oliver passes on the wine.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                     (to Claude)
                 Non merci, c'est de la merde.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                     (to Oliver)
                 La ferme.  C'est du bon vin.
                     (to Zed)
                 The fucking English.

       Zed sips some.  He's in no real shape to tell if the wine's 
       good or not.

<b>       ON STAGE
</b>
       Suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder.  
       The horns really start to scream and the room becomes a 
       delirium of music.

       The band stands up.

<b>       IN THE AUDIENCE
</b>
       The people watching start to dance, if not in their seats 
       then right in front of everything.

<b>       ZED'S TABLE
</b>
       Suddenly, Zed notices something...

<b>       ON STAGE
</b>
       Eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the 
       band.

<b>       ZED'S TABLE
</b>
       Zed blinks but it's true.

       Oliver and Claude start laughing.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 Look at him.  He's crazy.

<b>       ON STAGE
</b>
       And surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up 
       with the other musicians and sounding pretty good.

       Eric is all smile as he plays with them.  Sweat is running 
       down his face but he's caught up in the moment.

       ELISE, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the 
       stage, caught up in Eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like 
       James Brown.

       Then, the music crescendos and Eric hands the trombone back 
       to a musician.

       The set is over.

       Eric skips off the stage and walks over to where Oliver, 
       Claude, and Zed are sitting.

</b>
       The sub level teller and the sub lobby assistant walk into 
       the sub lobby just as Eric, Zed, Oliver, and the bank manager 
       start coming down the stairs.

       At the sight of Eric and his men the sub lobby guard #2 aims 
       his weapon but does not fire because of the bank manager.

       Eric presses his Uzi against the bank manager's neck.

       After a moments thought about this, and the fact that Oliver 
       has a sawed-off aimed at him, he slowly puts his gun on the 
       floor.

       Eric pushes them infront of the Calibre vault door.

       He releases the bank manager and stuffs the barrel of his

       The sub lobby teller's eyes plead with the bank manager.

       The bank manager, shocked as he is, looks at Zed.  He knows 
       he's an American.

       The sub lobby teller's body slumps to the ground.

       Eric grabs the stodgy customer and puts the gun to his 
       temple.

       the most horribly agonizing internal debate, he holds his 
       ground.

       Eric quickly removes the gun from the customers temple and 
       fires two shots into the bank manager's face.

       The bank manager falls against the vault door and onto the 
       floor.

       Zoey looks at all the people sitting around her.  They're all 
       scared.  Jean, Ricardo, and Francois are talking amongst 
       themselves.

<b>                           JEAN

                 the whole time was eating pussy.]

       Zoey looks up at them telling the joke.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 [The day finally came for his release.  
                 He walked out of the prison with a new 
                 suit and fifty francs the officials had 
                 given him, and made a bee-line for the 
                 whorehouse in the nearest town.  Slamming 
                 his fifty francs on the front desk, he 
                 said, "I wanna eat some pussy."]

       Jean is already laughing.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 [I'm not done.  Listen.  "Where've you 
                 been," said the greasy fellow behind the 
                 desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close 
                 look these days."]

       Zoey glances at all of the people.  Then her eyes lock with 
       the concierge security guard.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 ["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict, 
                 pulling him out of his chair by the shirt 
                 collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I 
                 want it now!"]

       The concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 ["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor, 
                 "I'll see what I can do."  So the ex-con 
                 followed him through to the very back of 
                 the warehouse through some stained, 
                 tattered red curtains, and into a grimy 
                 little room where a bedraggled looking 
                 whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed.  
                 "She's yours for fifty francs," said the 
                 proprietor, and the fellow went at it.]

       Zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an 
       ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it.  His fingers 
       begin to unsnap the safety harness on it.

       Her eyes widen.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 [After a little while, he came across a 
                 piece of egg.  "That's funny," he thought 
                 to himself, "I don't think I had egg for 
                 breakfast."  But he spat it out and kept 
                 eating away.  Next he found a piece of 
                 chipped beef wedged between his front 
                 teeth.  "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped 
                 beef this week," he thought, but kept on.  
                 Then he came across the corn.  "What is 
                 this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be 
                 sick."]

       The concierge security guard unsnaps the safety.  Zoey knows 
       he's going to make his move.

<b>                           RICARDO
</b>                 ["Ya know," says the whore, "that's what 
                 the last guy said."]

       Before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips 
       out the .38 and fires three shots.

       Two of them hit Ricardo in the chest.  He falls to the 
       ground.

       The other hits Francois in the arm.

       In an instant Jean is firing his machine gun into the group 
       of people huddled on the floor.

       Everyone is screaming and trying to get away.

       Machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard 
       killing him dead.

       Unfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into three 
       of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan officer, 
       killing them all.

       People are trying to flee but Claude fires his gun into the 
       ceiling.

       Francois is on the ground holding his arm.  He keeps rolling 
       back and forth in pain.

       Ricardo is dead.

       Jean, Claude, and Oliver are waving their guns around ready 
       to kill someone any second.

<b>                           CLAUDE
</b>                 [The gun!  Somebody get it!]

       Oliver goes over to the dead security guard, the whole time 
       waving his gun at people.

<b>                           OLIVER
</b>                 [Don't fuck with me!  Don't fuck with

       He grabs the gun from the dead security guards limp grip.

       Eric storms in.  He isn't wearing his mask.

       Eric looks over at Ricardo and then at the carnage.

       Eric grabs a WOMAN TELLER who is crying hysterically and 
       lifts her to her feet.

       He drags her to the ringing phone.

       Eric hangs up the phone, and then leaves it off the hook.

       Then Eric catches sight of Zoey, their eyes lock.  Eric 
       smiles and winks.  Then he turns to Jean with a whisper.

       Zed is drilling now with a hand drill.  He removes it and 
       blows into the hole.  Shavings come out.

       Eric comes trotting into the antechamber whistling.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Yes.  They're assholes.  Just having fun.

       Zed looks into the hole.

       He has drilled into the vault door, revealing some wiring.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Fucked up my drill bit.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 It's okay.  You can buy another one.

       Zed takes out a volt meter from his briefcase and inserts the 
       two prongs into the hole.

<b>                           ZED

       close behind him.

       Eric is a bit relieved.

       Zed opens it up.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Let's see.

       He looks through the fuses and then finds the one he wants.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and 
                 then back on when I call to you.  Any

       Eric smirks.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Oh, I wouldn't want to do that.

       Zed goes back to the vaults.

<b>       INT. BANK - VAULT ANTECHAMBER - DAY

       Zed trots back to the Poseidon vault door and quickly grabs a 
       little gizmo from out of his briefcase.  It is a little home-
       made black box with a series of LED's on it and two wires 
       coming out of one side with alligator clips on the end.  
       Three other wires are also coming out of it.

       He slips the alligator clips into the hole and latches them.

       He then tapes one of the wires to the vault itself.

       The two remaining wires he hooks up to a large twelve volt 
       battery.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Come on sweetie don't fail me now.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Now!

       The lights go out and then back on.

       There is a whirring sound from the vault door.

       The LED's quickly go from red to green.

       There is a loud, heavy clicking as the vault door unlocks.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Open seasame.

       Zed smiles and swings the door open revealing the interior of 
       the Poseidon vault.

       Eric comes running in like a kid on Christmas morning.

<b>                           ERIC

       He and Zed hug.

</b>                 Oh my God it worked!

       Zed looks into the Poseidon vault at the passage connecting 
       it to the main vault.  It is covered by a small locked cage.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I can get through that lock in a minute.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Then do it.  We don't have all day.

       Zed enters the Poseidon vault.

<b>       INT. BANK - POSEIDON VAULT - DAY
</b>
       Zed goes to the gated passage which isn't much more than a 
       window in one upper side of the vault, but it's enough to get 
       him into the main vault.

       Eric is right behind him.

       Zed takes a twirl at the combination lock.

       Then, there's a gunshot.  The bullet comes from the Calibre 
       vault through the window and almost hits Zed.

       Zed falls backwards onto the floor.

       The bullet ricochets through the vault.

       Another shot is fired into the vault.

       Oliver comes running in with his gun ready for action.

                 my job.]

       Oliver and Eric look at each other and shrug.  Then Eric sees 
       something in Zed's briefcase.  It looks like grey clay.

       Zed starts to grab the plastique away from Eric.  Eric 
       resists.

</b>                     (holding his voice down)

       Eric creeps into the room and activates the detonator.

       Zed and Oliver run for cover.

       Eric tosses the bar of plastique through the caged window and 
       makes a break for it.

       There is a huge explosion in the adjoining main vault.  The 
       walls quake and a fireball bellows out of the caged window, 
       blowing it open.

       The vault guard #1 screams and then goes silent.

       Dust has blown out of the vault and is settling on Oliver, 
       Zed, and Eric, who is laughing like a madman.

       Zed is looking at him like he's crazy.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 You asshole!  You could have killed us

</b>                 But I didn't!  Let's go check out the 
                 damage.

       Eric gets up and walks into the Poseidon vault.

       Before Zed follows him he looks at Oliver who doesn't know 
       what to think.

       Eric laughs.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Zed look!

       He points to the caged window.  It's been blown off it's 
       hinges.

</b>                 I beat you!  I opened it in under three

       He starts laughing and then crawls through the connecting 
       passage into the Caliber vault.

       Zed, with his briefcase, follows.

<b>                           ZED

</b>                 I'll be at the other vault waiting for

       The main vault looks like what a vault would look like if it 
       were blown up from the inside.  On the floor is the still 
       smoldering body of the security guard.  The room is 
       incredibly smokey.

       Zed squeezes through the opening.

       Then, Eric, grinning like a schoolboy, emerges from the smoke 
       with a brick sized bar of pure gold.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Look at it!  We're all rich!

       The smoke clears and we see that on the far side of the vault 
       there is a huge platen on wheels with bricks of gold stacked 
       onto it.

       Eric starts laughing.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 We're rich!

       Zed looks at him like he's crazy.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 We're rich!

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 Yes but we're rich!

       Zed takes a seat at the vault door.  The backside of a vault 
       door looks like an incredibly intricate clock.  Zed removes 
       the Plexiglass shielding.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 I'm going to show the others.

       He squirms out of the entry with the brick of gold.

       Zed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using 
       his voltmeter to test electrical points.

       Eric walks into the reserve vault area.

       He stops.  He hears something.  A scratching sound.

       He looks at it's source, TWO POLICEMEN, decked out in black 
       flak jackets and gas masks are starting to come out of a 
       sewer manhole.

       Eric's eyes widen.  He takes his silencer out of his coat and 
       fixes it to his handgun.  Then, like a man with intent to 
       kill, he rapidly approaches them.

       The one who came out of the manhole turns just in time to see 
       Eric fire into his chest.  Then, Eric aims the gun into the 
       tight crawlspace and fires into the other man.  For safe 
       measure he empties his gun into the tiny causeway.

       He drops the gun into the hole and then shoves the other 
       policeman into it.  He then pushes a large utility wagon over 
       the manhole cover to stop anyone else from coming in.

       Zed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door.  He 
       glances over what he's done and makes a calculation on a 
       calculator.

       Then, there is a groaning sound.

       Zed, terrified, spins around.

       Another groaning sound.  The vault security guard isn't dead.  
       His body is charred and he's not moving but he's very much 
       alive.

<b>                           VAULT GUARD #1
</b>                 [I'm going to die...]

       Zed can't believe what he's seeing.

       He moves over to the body, leaving his work behind.

<b>                           VAULT GUARD #1

                 die...alone.]

       Zed hovers over the body, afraid to touch it.  He gives it a 
       nudge with his foot.

       The body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever.

       Zed kneels down next to the body.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Are you still there?

       Nothing.

       Zed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard #1 and 
       checks for a pulse.

       Nothing.

       Zed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse, then, like 
       he wants to get out of there as soon as possible, he 
       scrambles to the door and starts adjusting several switches.  
       He has wired a battery to two leads.  He takes out a wire 
       cutter and snips a wire.

       There is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as 
       the vault unlocks.

       Zed calls to Oliver from the passage.

<b>       INT. BANK - STORAGE/ELEVATOR AREA - DAY

       Oliver is staring at the dead bodies of the manager and sub

       Oliver turns the large wheel and opens the Caliber vault 
       door.

       With some amount of energy the door opens.  Standing inside 
       is Zed.

       Oliver puts his gun down and they go into the Calibre vault.

       Oliver sees the huge platen of gold bricks.  Zed puts his

       The sub lobby guard #2 braces himself for gunfire.

       Eric fires into him.  He is dead instantly.

       Everybody screams.

       Eric fires into his dead corpse until his gun runs out of 
       bullets.

       Eric looks at him and gives him a soft kiss on the cheek.

<b>                           ERIC
</b>                 You can no longer be in our club.  You

       Zed laughs, there's not gonna be much of a pie to eat.

                 You hardly know me.

       He slashes Zed across the face with the switchblade.  Zed 
       falls backwards and tumbles down the stairs like a rag doll.

       Eric walks into the back office.  The others look at each 
       other.

       Suddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the 
       shadows, Francois sees it and nervously fires.

       In the background the distinctive sound of European police 
       sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank.

       Also, an UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE is blaring orders over a 
       bullhorn.

       Francois runs back to Eric who has walked up to the elevator 
       via the back office.

       Jean becomes a berzerker and runs out into a cloud of smoke 
       and throws the tear gas container into the thick cloud.

       Then he turns to the police and holds his own gun to his

       A single bullet passes through his torso.  As Jean falls to

       Oliver is still firing, his face is red like a crazed man.

       From behind the counter the sub lobby assistant grabs a hold 
       of Claude and wrestles him to the ground.

       The other customers start to flee for cover.

       Oliver sees the fracas between the sub lobby assistant and 
       Claude.  It looks like the sub lobby assistant is getting the 
       upper hand.  Oliver swings his gun around and sprays machine 
       gun fire at them...killing them both.

       Zoey peeks up the stairs just in time to see Oliver bolt for

       Then, Zed and Zoey appear from the hall to the reserve vault

       Eric turns to them with his gun raised, when he sees them he 
       lowers it.

       They all stand there for a moment, the gunfire cracking away 
       upstairs.  Eric is more casual than he should be.

       Zed rushes Eric and Zoey starts scratching.  Eric drops the 
       gun but quickly whips out his knife.

       She tries to get away from Eric but he has a hold on her 
       shirt.

       Eric swipes at her with the knife and grazes he back.

       Then Eric slashes toward Zed who jumps back.

       Zoey falls to the floor.

                 What do you say to that Zed?

       He swipes and Zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade.

       Eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor.

       Zed takes this opportunity and kicks Eric in the face.

       Eric reaches for the knife.

       Zed, his hand bloody, dives onto Eric.

       Zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on Eric's hair.  
       She plunges her nails into his face.

<b>                           ERIC

       Zed is rabbit punching Eric from underneath.

       Then, Eric grabs a hold of Zed's balls and squeezes.

       Zed lets out a shrill scream.

       Eric starts elbowing Zoey in the face.

       The three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like 
       worms, unable to move because each is putting the other 
       through such agony.

       Then, Oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the 
       room.  His body is a mass of bullet wounds.

       He clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near 
       Zoey, Zed, and Eric.

       The sight of the gun gives Eric the strength only a madman 
       could posses.  He rolls over and throws Zoey off him.

       Then, he smashes his forehead into Zed's nose, bursting it.

       Eric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun.

       He gets to his feet and cocks the pump action.

<b>                           ERIC

       Eric turns back to them.

       Then, all of the French policemen, decked out in their 
       assault gear and wearing gas masks, storm down the stairs.  
       At the sight of Eric about to execute Zed they raise their 
       guns.

       Eric stops.

       It becomes quiet.

       Then, Eric looks back down at Zed and braces for the shotgun 
       kick.

<b>                           ERIC

       The police open fire with their French made assault machine 
       guns and fill Eric with bullets.  Instead of falling he does 
       a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red.

       The wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over Zed.

       An IMAGE overcomes Eric.

       Eric's dead body slumps to it's knees and flops on top of 
       Zed.

       Zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to Zoey.

       Zoey runs up to him and holds him.

       The police all charge into the secondary vault area and 
       secure the downstairs.

       Zoey is crying as she holds Zed.

       The police have their guns aimed at the two of them.

       Zoey looks up.

</b>                 No.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 Come on.  I have a car.

       Zoey puts her arm around Zed and helps him out of the 
       bank...never to return.

       Zoey is driving.  Zed looks like he's been in a burning 
       building.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 I'm so tired.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 We'll go to my flat.  You can rest there.  
                 Do you feel pain?

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 No...it was mostly his blood.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 I have a shower.  You can clean up there.

<b>                           ZED
</b>                 Thank you Zoe.

       He looks at her.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 My name is not Zoe.  Not any more.

       He looks forward at the streets of Paris.

<b>                           ZOEY
</b>                 You'll get well.  Then I'll show you the 
                 real Paris.

       They drive away.
