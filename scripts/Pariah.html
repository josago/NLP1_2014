<b>1   EXT/INT. NIGHTCLUB- EVENING                                   1

    A disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and
    hats crosses a narrow street. Lights flare, hands are
    stamped, torsos are patted down. Money exchanges hands. We
    descend into a black, throbbing tunnel.

    Explicit music booms from bassy club speakers.   Hips, legs
    feet dancing.

    A GO-GO DANCER struts and wiggles around a brass pole.   Hoots
    and cheers.

    The dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom.
    More cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband.

<b>                        FEMALE DJ (O.S.)
</b>              Let's go! Where all my sexy
              Sagittarian ladies at?

    Arms go up.   A collection of whoops ripple the crowd.

    The dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward
    headfirst. The CAMERA ROTATES as she stretches her booted
    heels into the crowd. We realize that she has been dancing
    on the ceiling.

<b>                           FEMALE DJ (O.S.)
</b>              Oh my God!

    ALIKE (pronounced AH-LEE-KAY), 17, covers her mouth, laughing
    and wide-eyed. She tries to back away from the stage, but is
    pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar
    bills. Among them is LAURA, 18, worldly and smooth.

<b>                        LAURA
</b>              Where your singles at?!! Where your
              singles at?!! Yeah, baby!

    Laura strains over Alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the
    dancer's boot. Alike drops her beer in all the jostling.

<b>                        FEMALE DJ
</b>              Goddamn I love my job!

    Laura stuffs a bill into Alike's now empty hand and forcibly
    waves Alike's wrist in the air.
<b>                                                             2.
</b>

    Alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins
    to direct her attention at her.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              Stop! Chill!!

<b>                        LAURA
</b>              Whatchu' come here for?!

    Alike shoves the dollar bill into Laura's chest and shoulders
    her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage.
    Laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at
    the edge of the stage. Alike looks away and breaks through a
    snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Oof,
              sorry ladies.

    Finally free of the throng, Alike takes a breath and looks at
    the clock on her cell phone.

<b>                          ALIKE (CONT'D)
</b>              Shit!

    She rolls her eyes back to the stage where Laura is no longer
    visible. Not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing
    crowd, she retreats for the bar.

<b>                          FEMALE DJ

</b>
    Alike beaches at an empty spot at the bar. Her gaze settles
    on a CUTE GIRL a little ways down, staring out at the dance
    floor. Alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her
    shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl.

<b>                          ALIKE
</b>              Hi.

    The girl ignores her. Alike clears her throat and speaks a
    little too loudly.

<b>                        ALIKE (CONT'D)
</b>              Umm... Hey! How are you?!

    The girl jerks around and frowns at Alike, looking her up and
    down.

<b>                          CUTE GIRL
</b>              What?!
<b>                                                                3.
</b>

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              Umm...sorry. I was just sayin'
              Umm...hi.

<b>                        CUTE GIRL
</b>              Oh.

    The girl dismisses Alike and turns back toward the floor.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              Oh. You wanna drink or something?
              Hey! Hey! Over here!

    Alike strains, snapping at the bartender. A CONFIDENT WOMAN
    swaggers up close to the girl and extends her hand. The cute
    girl takes it and allows herself to be lead to the dance
    floor. Alike looks around just in time to see her leaving.
    The bartender finally materializes, and Alike slinks away.


<b>3   INT. NIGHTCLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT                                  3
</b>
    Alike slumps into a long line of women waiting to squeeze the
    cramped, 2 stall bathroom. A COUPLE in front of her makes out
    vigorously, and she folds her arms and looks away.

    A buff 30-SOMETHING WOMAN with locs smiles and winks at
    Alike. Alike smiles and fidgets with her eyebrows and looks
    away. The line inches forward. Alike glances around
    searching for the woman. The 30-something has already lost
    interest, her attention now fully directed at a much more
    FEMININE WOMAN strutting out of the restroom. Embarrassed,
    Alike faces front again. Two androgynous gangsters (AGs) who
    have witnessed the whole thing nudge each other and sneer.
    Alike squares her shoulders and widens her stance. One of
    the AG's breaks out in laughter and they turn around as the
    line inches forward again. Alike pretends not to notice and
    slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch
    along the wall.

    Alike dozes on the couch.

<b>                        FEMALE DJ
</b>              Give it up for Sin-A-Min ladies!!

    Alike wakes with a start. She checks the time on her cell
    phone. Cursing, she scrambles up from the couch.

    Laura dances with a cute SHORT HAIRED GIRL.

    Alike spots the pair from afar and heads in their direction.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              C'mon, we're late.

<b>                        LAURA

</b>              Hold on a minute.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              C'mon, why you trippin'?

<b>                        LAURA
</b>              What?

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              Why are you trippin', you know I
              gotta go!

</b>              You know I gotta go.   I'ma get in

</b>              Lemme dance with shortie first,
              then I'll be ready.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              What?

    Laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair
    continue their wobbling, uneven groove. Alike endures several
    moments of invisibility as a sea of women, both "feminine"
    and "butch" push past her without a second glance. Alike tugs
    at Laura's jersey. Laura, happily tangled in her dance
    partner's embrace rolls her eyes.

<b>                        LAURA

    Laura sulks, frowning out at the night. Alike extends the
    olive branch.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              How many numbers you get? One?

</b>              I could've gotten more, but your
              moms was holding me up.

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>              Oooh.   That's jacked up.

<b>                        LAURA

              that's old, I can delete that one.
              Tonya...

    Laura snatches the phone from Alike. Alike swipes at it but
    misses. Laura fends her off with one hand and scrolls through
    the numbers with the other.

<b>                        LAURA
</b>              Ain't Shelley that chick from your

              These are your damn study group
              numbers! Why you frontin'?!

    Alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her
    sleeve.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              I don't see you with no list of
              numbers.

<b>                        LAURA

    Alike shrugs it off, her smile fading a little. Laura elbows
    her and sneers.

    Alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears
    on. A middle-class Bronx landscape, well-lit with a newly
    constructed Starbucks and renovated condos flits by the
    window. Alike reaches over and presses the tape. Laura elbows
    Alike.

<b>                        LAURA
</b>              Quit playing.

<b>                           ALIKE

              stops.

<b>                        LAURA

    The bus pulls to the curb. The light flicks on over the back
    door.
<b>                                                             7.

    Alike elbows Laura sharply. The bus driver frowns in the rear
    view.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              I'm not beastin'.

    Laura climbs over Alike and swings toward the door.

<b>                        LAURA
</b>              You got a problem. Call me.

<b>                        ALIKE
</b>              I'ma call you.

    Alike turns and watches Laura stroll away. Laura drums a
    little beat on Alike's window as the bus pulls off. Alike
    waves and faces forward again. An OLD LADY sitting nearby
    shoots her a disapproving look. Alike rolls her eyes and
    moves to a seat farther away.


<b>8   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                         8
</b>
    Alike studies her reflection in the window, and takes a
    breath. She unbuttons her bulky men's shirt to reveal a
    fitting baby doll shirt that reads "Princess." She stuffs
    her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair
    of small gold hoop earrings into her ears. She slumps back
    against the seat and stares into the night.

    The bus stops at a lonely island of curb. Alike is a dark
    silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night.

    Alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip
    through. The house is dark except for the flashing microwave
    clock.

Alike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway. Her
younger sister, SHARONDA's door cracks open as she passes.

Alike shoves her sister and tries to close the door. Sharonda
yanks the door open wider.

Sharonda puts a hand to her head and does a little dance.

<b>                      ALIKE

Alike eases Sharonda's door shut.     Sharonda swings the door
open wide.

<b>                    SHARONDA
</b>          Good night Lee!

Sharonda slams her door.      The light clicks on underneath
Alike's parent's door.

     She tosses her shoes in the closet just as her mother, AUDREY

     Audrey gets cozy in the doorjamb.      Alike turns her back on
     her and slumps into pajamas.

     to the top of the closet.

     Audrey stiffens and pulls her robe tighter. Vinegar replaces
     honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice.

     it around her head.

     Audrey leaves. Alike is still. She listens for the door to
     her parent's room to shut before snatching off the scarf and
     storming to the bathroom.

     She plops down on the toilet and looks up. A crucifix frowns
     down at her from the wall.

</b>
     Alike, bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the
     perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter. STUDENTS
     horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups, chugging
     their morning Fantas and munching on snack cakes. The school
     bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building.
     Alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last
     STRAGGLERS finally trickle in. She yanks her hoodie tighter
     and launches across the lawn and into the building.


<b>13   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING                             13
</b>
     A second school bell sounds and the din of slamming lockers
     and jubilant chatter dies to a hush as students shuffle into
     classrooms. Alike cracks the back stairwell door and peeks
     out into the mostly empty hallway before tearing for the
     bathroom. One last straggler BINA, a 17 year-old girl with
     mature, but down-to-earth good looks rushes past Alike. The
     two exchange a brief, confused look then mutually dismiss
     each other as they hurry in opposite directions.

</b>
     Alike hurtles into the handicapped stall and snaps it shut
     behind her. She rips off her hoodie and the "girly" shirt
     beneath and flings them to the floor. She pulls out a pair of
     wife-beaters from her bag and pulls them over her head. She
     unwads a polo shirt and yanks it over her head.

     She stares at her reflection in the window and tries
     unsuccessfully to smooth her shirt. Her eyes scour her
     reflection again and again for any imperfections. She spots
     the earrings and yanks them out of her ears. The late bell
     beckons and Alike stuffs her "feminine" clothes into her
     backpack and bolts.


<b>15   INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY                                    15

     The MATH TEACHER glides up and down the aisles passing out
     graded tests. A chorus of groans follows in her wake.

<b>                         MATH TEACHER
</b>               As promised, I will be grading
               these on a curve.

     Alike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom.
     The desks in front her and beside her are empty. She is
     ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes.

<b>                         MATH TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>               But the highest grade on the test
               was a 98.

     The math teacher puts Alike's test on her desk and gives her
     a little smile. Alike doesn't smile back.

     The lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado, clearing the
     room in a rush of limbs, shouts, and backpacks. Alike jabs
     her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very
     deliberately, letting the eye of the storm pass over her
     before heading toward the door.

     The cafeteria is a whirl of activity and social jockeying.
     Clusters of girls and boys loud-talk, flirt, fight and
     horseplay at tables and in tight little groups against the
     walls. Alike walks alone, staying at the fringes of the crowd
     and shrugs through the cafeteria line.

     dubious nutritional value. She raps on the door of a
     classroom and slips in.

     MRS. ALVARADO, a middle aged Californian ex-hippie type
     reclines with her feet on her desk, munching on celery sticks
     and sunflower seed paste. Her small desk radio plays
     alternative rock. Sun beams into the empty classroom and
     Alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and
     pulls up a chair next to her desk.

     Alike hands over her purple and white composition book. Mrs.

     Mrs. Alvarado flips to the back of the book and her mouth
     moves silently as she reads.

</b>               I'll probably do it in class.

     another celery stick.

     cover.

</b>               I believe you can go deeper.

     Audrey is a heat-seeking missile, whipping through the sparse
     hallways of the trauma wing, her clipboard and pen in
     constant motion. NURSES and AIDES scatter in her wake,
     suddenly busying themselves with little bits of chore work to
     avoid her caustic gaze. She barks at a cluster of CLERKS chit-
     chatting in the elevator bank and all but one manage to
     escape. Audrey drills her.

     Audrey whisks her lunch bag out of the fridge and heads
     toward a table. A few lounging AIDES wad up their garbage and
     flee the break room. Audrey settles down at the table and
     pulls a fashion magazine from her work tote, pretending not
     to be hurt. She peels open a cup of vanilla yogurt and begins
     reading. A big red department store bag sits next to her work
     tote. The television suspended over the table mumbles
     corporate healthcare infomercials. MRS. SINGLETARY, one of
     Audrey's co-workers swoops in and plops a plastic grocery bag
     on the table across from her.

     Audrey's steely exterior melts away and suddenly she is all
     butterflies and giggles. She rifles through the bag and
     hoists out a pink ribbed v-neck sweater.

Mrs. Singletary takes a bite of her lunch and takes the
sweater from Audrey.

Three ROWDY CO-WORKERS burst into the room chattering and
finger popping.

The co-workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various
parts of the breakroom. Audrey shoves the sweater back in the
bag and nestles it between her feet. Somebody cranks on a
small radio and a frisky R&B beat invades the air. Mrs.

Co-worker #3 shoves a tabloid in Mrs. Singletary's face,
tapping an angry orange fingernail in the middle of the page.

<b>                    MRS. SINGLETARY
</b>          Is that her?!

</b>Told you!                       Look how big she done got!

The center of the room shifts and Audrey is once again alone
at the fringes. She collects her shopping bag and looks
around to say goodbye, but no one notices her leave.

     Audrey, Sharonda, Alike, and their father, ARTHUR, 40-
     something with a used-to-be athletic build, are all gathered
     around the dinner table for a rare family dinner. Everyone
     takes half-hearted nibbles at their food avoiding eye contact
     with each other. Sharonda picks at her food.

     Audrey wilts.

</b>               I'm expecting a call.

     Sharonda.

</b>               This is your father's night off.

     Alike casts a glance in the direction of the bedroom, where
     Arthur can be heard talking in hushed tones. She rolls her
     eyes and slinks down into her seat.

<b>                         AUDREY (CONT'D)
</b>               So straighten up.

     Arthur settles back into his chair, his mood a little
     brighter. Seeing an opportunity for brownie points, Sharonda
     pitches in.

Arthur gives Alike an approving Daddy's girl wink. Alike
beams back.

          around my daughters anyway.

     Alike smirks and takes her plate to the sink. Arthur jabs her
     on the arm as she walks by. Audrey tears into a dinner roll
     shooting daggers at anyone who dares to make eye contact.

     Laura brings a steaming cup of Ramen noodles to a worn
     kitchen table splayed with bills. Her older sister CANDACE,
     a stout 30 something with pleasant but hard-working looks
     scribbles notes on the back of an envelope while soaking her
     feet. Laura takes a sip of her soup and starts sifting
     through a pile of envelopes.

     Candace pecks on a calculator and scribbles on the envelope.

     Laura locks her hands on top of her head and leans back in
     her chair, surveying the financial carnage.

Candace reaches inside a CERAMIC HEN on the table and pulls
out a wad of money. She counts out several hundred dollars
into an envelope.

Laura sucks her teeth.

Laura pushes up from the table and glares at Candace, a
showdown. Candace stares back, unfazed. Laura caves first.

<b>                    LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>          I'll get the money orders in the
          morning.

Laura tugs at the envelope but Candace doesn't let go right
away.

<b>                    LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>          I'll look into it alright?

Candace relinquishes the envelope and Laura stalks off down
the hallway to her room.

     of the water and kneads it.

     Alike sits off to one side of the stairs, headphoned into
     oblivion and scribbling into her composition book. A group of
     FAST GIRLS strut by and encamp on the opposite wall, giggling
     and yakking on cell phones. One of the girls, MIKA cuts a
     flirty smile at Alike. Alike turns away and buries herself in
     her book, but cranks down the volume on her iPod.

attempts to look casual.

Mika smiles as her eyes travel down Alike's physique. Alike,
aware of the admiring gaze tugs and smooths at her shirt
unnecessarily. She licks her lips and readjusts the book in
her lap, fighting hard to keep the grin off her face.

swaggers up to the girls, drawing their rapt attention.

     The girls erupt into titters, and they melt into
     conversation. Alike deflates, watching them over the top of
     her book. She observes every little moment between the girls
     and the boy, every wink. Another BOY joins the group and they
     stroll off down the sidewalk.

     Alike plucks the headphones out of her ears, watching them
     leave. Mika casts a parting glance over her shoulder at
     Alike. Remnant's of Alike's grin return reflexively. Mika's
     friend jerks her elbow around.

</b>          Obviously. Why you pressed about
          this chick?

Alike shrugs.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          I wanted to ask you about something
          else too.

</b>          I need you to get something for me.

<b>                    LAURA

Alike cocks her head at Laura. Laura frowns back.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          What?!

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          Just for my image.

Alike raises her eyebrow. Laura shakes her head. The light
bulb goes off. She roars in disbelief.

     Alike stares at herself in a floor length bedroom mirror in
     her underwear.

<b>                         LAURA
</b>               I think it looks natural.

     A peach-colored dildo dangles stiffly from Alike's waist.
     The harness bunches her boxers in clumsy tufts. Alike
     appraises the racially inappropriate apparatus and shoots
     Laura a look.

</b>               I'm serious, I mean it doesn't look

</b>               Well, first of all-- I don't think

     Alike yanks at the harness and her boxers trying to pull it
     out of her bottom.

</b>               It's supposed to fit like that.

Alike struggling with the apparatus.   Laura smiles.

</b>          Ugh! You gotta take it back.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          I can't take it back.

Sharonda bursts into the room.

Laura leaps from the bed and blocks Sharonda's path to the
doorway. Alike tackles Sharonda and wrestles her down to the
floor. Laura slams the door, shuts and locks it.

          you got it.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          I just borrowed it.

Alike pulls off the dildo and harness.

<b>                    SHARONDA
</b>          Give it back.

Alike fishes the make-up case out of her backpack. She holds
it out to Sharonda. Sharonda reaches for it. Alike jerks it
back.

<b>                    ALIKE

Alike flips open the make up case and jabs the dildo at it,
stopping short of the surface of the make up.

<b>                    SHARONDA
</b>          Ughh, I hate you.

Alike jabs the dildo closer to the make-up.

<b>                    SHARONDA
</b>          OK, OK I won't tell.   Daag!

Alike tosses the case at Sharonda who scrambles to catch it.
Alike wraps the dildo back up in the bag and hides it behind
her headboard. Sharonda saunters out into the hallway.

Audrey peers into the bedroom from the hallway, still dressed
for work, shoulder stooped from the weight of her tote bag.

<b>            ALIKE                           SHARONDA

          Oh. Hello Laura, I didn't see you
          standing there.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          Hi Mrs. Freeman.

<b>                    AUDREY
</b>          How's your mother?

<b>                         AUDREY
</b>               Well I hope so. And I'm so glad to
               hear your sisters finally getting
               back on her feet. Wasn't she--

<b>                         LAURA
</b>               She's good.

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               Mom?!

     Audrey fixes Laura with another hard glance and shoos
     Sharonda down the hallway. Laura starts to shut the door, but
     Audrey stops it with her arm.

<b>                         AUDREY
</b>               I think we'll just leave this open.
               Let some air circulate in here.

<b>                         LAURA
</b>               I was just about to leave, anyway.
               So...

     Audrey lingers, looking back and forth between Laura and
     Alike. Alike frowns at her mother.

     Satisfied that the conversation is over, Audrey moves off
     toward her room. Laura checks to make sure she's gone and
     whispers to Alike.

<b>                         LAURA
</b>               Just try it.

     A group of girls approaches, one of them we recognize as
     Mika, the girl that likes Alike, from the bathroom. Laura
     stands to greet them. Nervous introductions all around. Laura
     shoots Alike a warning glance.

     Alike fidgets in her seat and keeps pulling at the knees of
     her jeans. Mika hand in chin, stares into space. Alike does
     another pull-fidget combo. Mika rolls her eyes at her.

</b>               No, no not really. I'm not really
               feeling the music.

     Mika sighs and looks around at the other dancing couples.
     Alike gives her jeans another tortured tug. Agonized minutes
     of awkward booming silence.

     closet. She unharnesses the dildo and wads the tangled mess
     up in an old t-shirt. She stuffs the wad in back of the
     closet and slams the closet door shut, staring at her
     reflection in the mirror.

     room.

     watching.

     Audrey hobbles out with one high heel on. She snatches the
     remote from Alike and snaps the TV off.

     The front door bursts open, and Arthur tromps in, his police
     uniform hanging open over a white undershirt. He slings a
     heavy F.O.P tote bag on the floor and strips off his shirt as
     he crosses to the kitchen. Audrey rushes over and buzzes
     around him.

     Audrey scuttles over to where Arthur is now digging through
     the open fridge. He pulls out a foil covered plate, tears
     open one corner, sniffs it.

     Arthur heads toward the microwave with the plate. Audrey

Alike stalks off to her bedroom. Sharonda bounces into the
kitchen.

Sharonda pecks dad on the cheek. Dad wipes his cheek and rubs
his fingers together.

Sharonda giggles and bounds back into her bedroom. Audrey
slides a steaming plate in front of Arthur.

</b>          It's Sunday morning.

</b>          It goes with the spaghetti.

Audrey lifts a beer out of the fridge and slides it in front
of Arthur. She pulls up a chair as he plows through the meal,
her expression softening as she caresses his forearm.

<b>                    AUDREY

<b>                    ARTHUR

          to restaurants and keep designer
          sneakers in the closet, yes.

Alike stomps back into the kitchen wearing the pink v-neck
that Audrey bought her and an unflattering pleat-front skirt.
Arthur stifles a giggle behind his beer can.

Audrey frowns at Arthur. Arthur stands his ground.

     Arthur slams his fork on the plate. Audrey flinches. Alike
     looks up. Sharonda appears in the doorway, looking from
     Audrey to Arthur.

<b>                            SHARONDA

     Arthur pushes up from the table.

</b>               Alike, you look beautiful.
               Everybody looks beautiful, okay?

     Arthur disappears into the bedroom. Alike snatches up her
     bible and launches out the door, Sharonda follows. Audrey
     pulls on her sunglasses and hat and slams the door behind
     her.

     Alike sits in the passenger seat of the car as Audrey chit
     chats with other churchgoers. Sharonda sits in the back
     seat, flipping through a CD case and occasionally passing
     CD's to Alike to play. Alike faces stonily forward except to
     cast impatient glances in Audrey's direction. Audrey raps on
     the window.

<b>                         AUDREY
</b>               Lee! Lee! Here's someone I want you

<b>                     ALIKE

Audrey motions to Bina standing by with her mother, Ms.
Singletary. Alike cracks the window a little wider and
acknowledges them with a half-hearted wave.

<b>                    AUDREY
</b>          Get down out the car and come

Laboriously, Alike rolls the window back up, turns off the
car radio, and climbs down out of the car.

<b>                    AUDREY (CONT'D)

</b>          So. Now that we're all acquainted,

<b>                           ALIKE
</b>               So don't.

     Bina stops short.   Alike keeps walking.

<b>                         BINA
</b>               Look Alike, Lee. Whatever it is you
               wanna be called. I'm not trying to
               hang out with you, either, but I'm
               not about to take an L for it. So
               stop dodging me, let's just go to
               school together and be done with
               it. We don't have to see each
               other any other time than that.

     Alike doesn't miss a step.    Bina yells after her.

<b>                         BINA (CONT'D)
</b>               Whatever, my mother asks me again,

               your mother, then it's whatever for
               you.

     Alike stops short. Bina crosses the street and continues in
     the direction away from school. Alike spins around scanning
     the street, then catches sight of her on the opposite
     sidewalk.

<b>                           ALIKE

<b>                    ALIKE (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey!

Alike checks for traffic then dashes across the street to
catch up with her.

<b>                    ALIKE (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey look, I'm sorry.

<b>                    BINA
</b>          Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna
          bug out.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          No for real, I'm sorry. I didn't
          mean to be that way. It's just...
          OK, I am concerned that my, my mom
          will find out, but...

<b>                    BINA
</b>          But?

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          It's not like that. It's just--
          she's just. If you knew her, you'd
          understand. She's like, I don't
          know.

The girls walk in silence for a moment.

<b>                    ALIKE (CONT'D)
</b>          So what's your favorite class?

<b>                    BINA
</b>          You don't have to make small talk.
          Let's just walk.

<b>                    ALIKE

Alike relaxes her shoulders, both relieved and surprised.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    BINA
</b>          I can tell. I've seen--I mean, a

</b>               Anyway, like I said, we don't have
               to talk. Just walk.

     Alike's cell phone chirps--it's Laura.    Alike sighs and
     stuffs the phone back into her pocket.

     Laura snaps her cell phone shut. A GED study book still
     glossy and uncreased is propped open on the bed in front of
     her. She opens her cell phone again and pulls up Alike's
     number. Her thumb hovers over the `talk' button. She snaps
     the phone shut and tosses it aside before turning the radio
     down and dragging the book closer. The cell phone rings and
     she snatches it up. A picture of a girl making a kissy face
     with the name "Tasha" underneath blinks onto the screen and
     Laura snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside. She hoists
     the GED book into her lap and lets her head hit the wall.
     There is a knock at her bedroom door and Candace peeks in.

<b>                         CANDACE

<b>                            LAURA

     Candace smiles at Laura and hesitates before closing the
     door. Candace turns the radio off before ducking back out.
     Laura sighs and flips back to the beginning of the book.


<b>38   INT. SPORTS CLUB BASKETBALL COURT - DAY                       38
</b>
     Alike and Arthur cavort in a sloppy half-court game in the
     fluorescent glare of the gym. Well-heeled clientele cross to
     and fro munching power bars and sipping Gatorade. Arthur has
     an awful shot, but Alike's is worse. Alike heaves a huge
     airball past the basket.

</b>               Yeah but at least I hit the
               backboard. Damn.

     Alike rushes to guard Arthur who dribbles clumsily around the
     key. He tries a crossover move and lobs an ugly shot toward
     the basket.

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               Brick!!

     Laughing, they tussle over the rebound. Arthur recovers.

</b>
     MACK, the store proprietor leans against the counter flipping
     through a newspaper. Arthur, in uniform mulls through the
     sports section. A ratty looking man, SOCK sips from a red
     plastic cup.

     Mack cranks the volume on the tiny television above the
     counter.

</b>          It's on again... Check it out Free.
          Channel 5 and Channel 2.

Arthur appears on the TV screen, dressed in suit, tie,
sunglasses and looking impressive. He is talking to a news
reporter and a bad news graphic reading "East Side Drug Bust--
Detective Arthur Freeman" blots out the bottom of the screen.

<b>                    SOCK

          Danny Glover!

Arthur and Mack laugh and slap hands. Sock sneers at their
revelry.

The bell over the door tinkles and a heavyset BUTCH WOMAN
strolls in. Her head is shaved and a thick wallet chain
clinks against her ample carpenter pants. All three men turn
to stare.

<b>                    MACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Been more of that since they opened
          up that new club `cross the way.

Arthur grunts and returns to his paper.

</b>          Hey, my man! You hear me talkin' to
          you?!

Mack snatches Sock's cup. Sock pivots around to protest.

<b>                    SOCK
</b>          Hey!!

<b>                    MACK
</b>          Mind your business.

Sock yanks his cup back and turns to resume his taunts. He's
caught off guard and stumbles backward as the woman pushes up
to the counter with a case of liquor. Arthur steps out of the
way and observes.

<b>                    BUTCH WOMAN
</b>          And a pack of Kools.

Mack nods and fishes under the counter.

</b>          Look I just had a simple question I
          wanted to ask. See, I just want to
          know how does pussy taste?

The woman directs her full attention at Sock for the first
time. Mack watches as he quickly punches in the sale. Arthur
stiffens.

<b>                    SOCK (CONT'D)
</b>          You know, I just wanna know if you
          go with women for the taste, or is
          it just you're too big, black, and
          ugly so don't no man want you?

Sock laughs at his own nasty joke and takes a sip from his
cup.

<b>                    MACK
</b>          $65.07 ma'am.

The woman counts out the money and smiles at Sock.

<b>                    BUTCH WOMAN
</b>          I can't lie, pussy do taste good.

<b>                     SOCK

The woman picks up her case.

<b>                    BUTCH WOMAN (CONT'D)
</b>          --ask yo' wife how she likes me!

The woman winks at Sock. Arthur chokes back a guffaw. As soon
as the woman clears the door, Arthur and Mack explode in
laughter. Sock is livid and screams after her.

Arthur slams Sock against the counter before he can finish
his sentence.

Arthur grinds Sock's collar tighter around his trembling
fist. Sock glares back, clearly punked.

     Mack sweeps Sock's plastic cup off the counter and into a
     garbage can. Sock tromps to the door.

     underneath the counter. Arthur's eyes linger on the door and
     his jaw tightens.

     only in boxers and a wife beater. Laura holds a bright orange
     polo shirt up in front of Alike's torso. Alike cocks her head
     to the side and considers.

Laura pulls away the orange polo shirt and hands Alike a
turquoise one instead. Alike hoists the oversized shirt over
her head.

Laura shakes her head as she plucks a brand new baseball cap
from the wall rack and drops it onto Alike's head. Alike
considers and takes it off. Laura puts another cap in its
place. Before Alike can object, Laura tosses her a pair of
denim shorts.

they don't fall down. Laura tosses her a belt and admires
Alike's reflection.

Alike peels out of the polo shirt.

     Laura crosses to her closet and scans its inventory. The
     jeans are arranged crisply on hangers from light to dark and
     some still have store tags. Most of the shirts are still
     enclosed in protective plastic covers from the dry cleaners.
     Laura passes Alike a perfectly folded button down shirt.

     wilts.

</b>What?

<b>             BINA
</b>Nothin'.

<b>          ALIKE
</b>No, what'd you say?

<b>             BINA
</b>Nothin'.

<b>          ALIKE
</b>Yeah, I had on a different shirt.

<b>          BINA
</b>Oh... Well, that's cool.

<b>          ALIKE
</b>So why weren't you gonna say
anything about it?

<b>          BINA
</b>About your shirt?

<b>          ALIKE
</b>About the poem.

<b>          BINA
</b>Cause you're moody.

<b>             ALIKE
</b>Moody?

<b>             BINA
</b>And quiet.
<b>                                                               61.
</b>

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               Man, I'm not moody.

<b>                         BINA
</b>               Yeah, right.

     Bina stops.

<b>                           ALIKE
</b>               What?

<b>                         BINA
</b>               This is me.

     Alike looks up at the stoop, surprised.

<b>                         BINA (CONT'D)
</b>               It's not so bad when there's some
               conversation, huh?

     Alike looks away.

<b>                         BINA (CONT'D)
</b>               You wanna come up?


<b>51   INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                             51
</b>
     Alike sits on Bina's twin bed, looking around and really
     taking in the room for the first time. She reaches over and
     picks up a little molded soldier figure off of the shelf.
     Bina fishes around in a rack of CDs.

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               Who gave you this?

<b>                         BINA
</b>               What the bear? My dad.

<b>                           ALIKE
</b>               No, this.

     Alike holds the figurine out, Bina looks at it over her
     shoulder.

<b>                         BINA
</b>               Oh that. Girl, my stupid ex-
               boyfriend gave me that.

<b>                           ALIKE
</b>               Oh. Cute.

     Bina opens a CD case and pulls the booklet out.
<b>                                                        62.
</b>

<b>                    BINA
</b>          Not really. I mean I guess it was
          at the time.

Bina lobs the little army man into a trash can across the
room and hands Alike the booklet.

<b>                    BINA (CONT'D)
</b>          Anyway, this is the other artist I
          was telling you about. Her stuff is
          like, bouncier.

A buoyant Afropunk beat wafts through the bedroom. Bina plops
down on the bed next to Alike.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          This is straight. You'll burn me a
          copy?

<b>                     BINA
</b>          Yeah, I have a bunch of other
          stuff, too.
              (beat)
          So who do you hang out with? I
          don't really see you with anybody.

Alike shrugs and rifles through her backpack. She pulls out
her composition book. Awkward silence.

<b>                    BINA (CONT'D)
</b>          I didn't mean it like that. I was
          just asking because I was curious.
          I don't really like anybody that
          goes there either.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          My friend Laura used to go there.
          Not now, but she's going back.

<b>                    BINA
</b>          Oh because, I was just gonna say--
          I'm going to this house party and
          you can come if you want to.

Bina waves her hand at the radio.

<b>                    BINA (CONT'D)
</b>          They play this kind of music.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          Sure. How'm I supposed to dress?
<b>                                                           63.

<b>                    BINA
</b>          You don't dress. You just come
          however. Come as you are.

Alike nods.

<b>                       BINA (CONT'D)
</b>          Can I see?

Bina snatches the book from Alike's hands and starts flipping
through pages before Alike can answer.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          Yeah...But that's mainly old stuff,
          though.

<b>                    BINA
</b>          This is the one you did today?

<b>                       ALIKE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                       BINA
</b>          Nice.

Bina offers the journal back to Alike. Alike reaches for it.
Bina pulls it away at the last second--an impromptu game of
keep away.

<b>                       BINA (CONT'D)
</b>          Take it.

Alike misses again. The girls crack up.

<b>                    BINA (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry, here.

Bina yanks it away again. Alike gives up, still smiling.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          You play too much.

<b>                    BINA
</b>          Seriously, it's right here.     Just
          take it.

Alike summons the courage for one last swipe. She manages to
grab it but Bina doesn't let go right away. The girls lock
eyes during the extemporaneous tug-of-war.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          Thank you...
<b>                                                             64.
</b>

<b>                         BINA
</b>               You're welcome...

     Beaming with her victory, Alike busies herself with the
     journal. Bina recruits a small stuffed moose for her next
     foray. She dances the moose up Alike's arm and plants an
     exaggerated peck on her cheek with it.

<b>                            BINA (CONT'D)
</b>               Mmmwaahhh!

     The girls erupt into renewed giggles. Bina tosses the stuffed
     animal aside and scoots closer to read over Alike's shoulder.

<b>                         BINA (CONT'D)
</b>               What's so private?

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               Nothin', just my writings...

     Bina studies Alike's profile. She leans in and pecks Alike on
     the cheek. Alike lets the kiss soak in, glancing at Bina
     sidelong. Bina leans in again, this time planting a long kiss
     on Alike's lips. Alike pulls away. Bina tenses for the
     verdict.

<b>                         ALIKE (CONT'D)
</b>               Why'd you do that for?

<b>                            BINA
</b>               Sorry---

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               No, I'm sorry. I just umm...I gotta
               go.

<b>                         BINA
</b>               I thought--

<b>                            ALIKE
</b>               Sorry.

     Alike blindly grabs up her things and rushes the door, Bina
     flounders in her wake.


<b>52   INT. LAURA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING                          52
</b>
     Laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades. A
     cute Puerto Rican girl is draped around Laura's neck like a
     PERSONAL CHEERLEADER. Music blasts from the TV but doesn't
     drown out the hoots and banter of the rollicking entourage.
     There is a knock at the door.
<b>                                                        65.
</b>

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          You'll get that for me?

One of the friends breaks away from the pack, opens the door
without greeting and walks away. Alike is left alone to
escort herself in. Laura hardly looks up as Alike stops at
the fringes of the pack.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          Wassup man.

A collective grumble of greeting goes up around the table
although no one addresses Alike directly. Laura slams the
table and raises her hands in triumph.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          Board, goddammit!! I told you!

<b>                    PIER GIRL #1
</b>          Awww, we shoulda been done set you!

Laura slaps hands with her partner. The unlucky pair of
partners argue. The personal cheerleader kisses Laura on the
neck. Alike looks away.

<b>                    PERSONAL CHEERLEADER
</b>          Good game, baby!

<b>                    LAURA

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          Just came to say wassup.

<b>                    LAURA

<b>                    PIER GIRL #2
</b>          Three, maybe four.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          We goin' eight!!

Roars of disbelief from around the table. Alike is quickly
forgotten in the ruckus. Alike circles to Laura's side. The
personal cheerleader looks her up and down.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          Can I talk to you for a second?

<b>                    LAURA

</b>

                   (to Alike)
               Yo, I'm busy right now.

     More raucous laughter from the table. Alike endures another
     few moments of card slapping, table pounding dejection before
     leaning into Laura's ear.

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               I really need to talk to you--

<b>                         LAURA
</b>               I said later!

     Wide-eyed silence and scattered snickers around the table.
     Laura resumes her hand and the game banter cranks back up.
     Alike picks up her face and slips away.

<b>                         PIER GIRL #3
</b>               Thought that was your girl?

<b>                         LAURA
</b>               Mind your business. Bam! That's
               what I thought!

     Laura slaps another card on the table and takes a deep swig
     of water.


<b>53   INT. ALIKE'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        53
</b>
     Audrey lies awake in bed. The clock on the nightstand
     indicates a little past two in the morning. She looks at the
     sliver of light underneath the bedroom door, the sound of
     Arthur's key in the door breaks the silence. Arthur's voice
     in hushed tones. Audrey rolls over and faces the wall.

     Alike watches her father's footsteps break up the light
     beneath her door. She tosses off her blankets and springs
     into the hallway.

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>                   (loud whisper)
               Hey Dad!

     She is talking to empty air. She eases down the hallway
     toward the kitchen and the sound of his muffled voice.

     Alike stops short outside the kitchen door, confused.

               Hey, I'll talk to you later,
               alright? My daughter's up.

     Arthur flips his cell phone shut and tucks it into his
     pocket. He fishes a beer out of the fridge.

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               Who was that?

     Arthur sips his beer and walks over to the kitchen table. A
     foil covered plate with a little pink sticky note waits.

<b>                         ARTHUR

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               Just wanted to talk.

     Arthur crumples the sticky note and tosses it into the trash
     without reading it. He peels up one side of the foil, peeks
     at the food underneath, and launches it into the trash, too.

<b>                         ALIKE (CONT'D)

     into the living room.

Alike rescues the plate from the garbage and carefully lays
it in the sink so it doesn't clatter.

Arthur explodes.

chair for her.

Arthur offers her the beer. Alike takes it to the head.

Arthur snatches the beer from her. They laugh. Alike picks at

Arthur scents the heavy news packed in Alike's expressive
pause and scrambles to intercept her at the pass.

<b>                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)

          Ha-ha! Wait `till your mama finds

Alike plays along, swallowing her disappointment.

<b>                    ALIKE
</b>          Yeah.

Arthur pushes back from the table and pulls a fresh police
uniform out the hall closet. He lays it across the back of
the couch and unzips his pants. Alike turns her back to give
him privacy.

<b>                    ARTHUR

          store--have you--do you--you

Alike shakes her head no. Arthur tucks his undershirt into
his pants.

</b>          Good. I know you will.

Alike glances back at Arthur and sees that he's decent. She
scoots back around to face him. Arthur smooths his uniform
shirt into his pants.

<b>                    ALIKE

     Arthur picks up his work tote and kisses Alike on the
     forehead.

     Laura jams a pillow into a t-shirt as a makeshift pillowcase
     as she escorts one of the pier girls to the couch. The pier
     girl looks slightly unkempt and is relieved to plop her
     knapsack on the floor. Laura tosses the pillow onto the
     couch.

     Laura pulls up close to the kitchen table. The GED test prep
     book, now dog-eared and worn is on the table in front of her.

     She finds her place and copies notes and multiple choice
     answers into a spiral notebook. A stack of old Math and
     English textbooks are in a chair next to her and the room is
     peaceful and still save for the scratching of her pencil.

     her breath and approaches.

     in front of Mack's liquor store.

     out of the car.

     Arthur shouts a greeting to Mack who lounges on a plastic
     chair outside his door. Sock and TWO OTHER MEN chit chat
     nearby. Their chatter lowers as Arthur approaches. Alike bops
     into the store.

<b>                            MACK

     Arthur claps Mack on the shoulder and glimpses Sock
     whispering to one of the men.

     Arthur follows the men's gazes over to Alike at the potato
     chip rack. She twirls the string of her basketball shorts
     round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t-
     shirt up over her nose. The smile evaporates from Arthur's
     face.


     Sock peers back at him, smirking. Arthur starts toward him,
     when Alike saunters out between them.

</b>               I'll holler at you later.

     Arthur crosses the lot in a bound, snatches the car keys from
     Alike's hand, and hustles her into the car.

     Alike frowns, then catches sight of the men in front of the
     store. She slumps into the car and slams the door. Arthur
     piles into the driver's seat. They sit in silence for a
     moment, Alike traces the lines in her hands.

Arthur slips in and lays his holster on an armchair, not even
bothering to approach Audrey's sleeping form.

Arthur peeks inside the fridge and inspects one of Audrey's
foil covered plates. He tosses it aside and gathers sandwich
ingredients instead. Audrey yawns and props herself up on one
elbow.

     performers, guitar riffs rock the large loft apartment and
     render their voices practically inaudible.

     surrounded by dozens of other clamorous bodies

     --One performer beckons Alike up onto the table, Alike demurs

     Lights glisten across the Hudson River--distant orbs
     reflected in a thousand shimmering faux stars in weak
     defiance against the night sky. A sodium vapor glow veils
     everything in generous haloes, making the night more
     beautiful than it really is.

     Dancing silhouettes, laughing, playing, yelling, flying,
     always dancing silhouettes punctuate the summer breeze with
     clapping set to the rhythm of soulful house. Like Puck on a
     midsummer's night, like Peter Pan and his lost boys. Among
     the silhouettes is Laura, enthroned atop a railing. Laura,
     smoking a joint grandly, surrounded by an adoring circle, a
     sycophantic harem of four.

</b>

     Laura, completely miserable as she watches two other
     silhouettes drawing closer, spinning, collapsing, now
     righting, always connected. Alike and Bina. Bina smiles and
     snakes her arms around Alike's neck. Alike too shy to react,
     giggles and folds. Laura watches the pair spin and passes to
     the left before stalking off toward the connected shadows.


<b>65   EXT. THE PIERS- CONTINUOUS                                65
</b>
     Laura cuffs Alike on the neck, pulling Alike's hoodie up over
     her face. Alike's laugh is tentative at first, not sure
     whether this is play or for real. Laura chuckles, breaking
     the ice. The pair slapbox and rough house, both missing with
     wild arcing blows. Laura aims a mini charge at Alike that
     lifts her off the ground and deposits her a short distance
     away. Alike swipes Laura's hat. Laura claps Alike on the
     shoulder and Alike waves to Bina. Bina waves and smiles.

</b>               So whatchu you think? She's cool
               right?

     Laura looks around and shrugs. Laura plucks a fresh joint out
     of her coat and lights it.

<b>                         ALIKE (CONT'D)

     Laura takes a puff and offers it to Alike.

<b>                         LAURA
</b>               This one's just for me and you.

     Alike waves it off, oblivious and intoxicated with the night.

<b>                         ALIKE
</b>               And she's smart, too. She does

     Laura stops walking and Alike skips ahead, still chattering.

Alike shakes her head. Her mouth moves but nothing comes out.

</b>          Because I love you, alright? And
          I'm sayin'...I'm right here.

Alike is stopped cold, as the light bulb finally goes off.
Laura takes a long drag on the joint. Bina and Mika stumble
over giggling. Bina hooks Alike's arm. Mika kisses Laura on
the neck. Laura snaps out of her gaze, her familiar smirk
creeping back.

<b>                    MIKA

Laura pinches out the joint and hands it to Mika who tucks it
away.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          That's for later. Bina, nice to

     Laura gives Bina a polite hug, pounds Alike on the shoulder
     and starts to lead Mika away.

     Laura pumps a lazy    fist in the air in acknowledgement. Bina
     takes Alike's hand    and slowly drags her away. Alike keeps
     looking back, then    finally gives up. Laura looks back just as
     Alike turns around    and disappears around the corner.

     Music videos play on the TV. Alike and Bina lay stretched out
     on pillows, a plate of brownie crumbs between them. Alike
     dozes. Bina smacks her with a pillow.

     Alike folds her arms behind her head. Bina strokes Alike's
     stomach. Her finger's dance at the top of Alike's pajama
     bottoms. Their eyes meet. Alike sits bolt upright.

     Alike leans in and kisses Bina on the lips. Bina considers
     and takes Alike's chin in her hand and kisses her back. Bina
     places Alike's hand on her chest. Alike lets her hand linger,
     then traces Bina's shoulders.

     Laura stands over the kitchen table shuffling through the
     mail. She pauses at a stiff envelope with her name on it. The
     return address reads "NYS Educational & Testing Services".
     She flips the envelope over and looks around, she rips the
     top off and eases the top of a slip out of the envelope. The
     top of the slip reads "'Campbell, Laura' GED TESTING

     Laura shifts her weight on a painted concrete porch outside a
     small wooden frame home. The paint is peeling and the flowers
     in the window-box are dead. A rusted metal mailbox next to
     the door overflows with circulars. Laura lifts the circulars
     out of the box and trashes them. She picks up a discarded
     fast food bag and tosses it too. A dog barks from a
     neighboring yard. Laura pulls open the screen door and tries
     to peer in through the diamond shaped window in the main
     door, but it's covered over in aluminum foil. More barking.
     Laura surveys the street and bangs hard on the door. She
     snaps the screen door back and takes a big step backward.
     Laura shifts her weight and smooths her shirt. LAURA'S
     MOTHER, 54, and no-nonsense opens the door and frowns down at
     Laura through the screen.

<b>                         LAURA

     down.

Laura's mother frowns up and down the block before refocusing
on Laura. Laura takes a step closer to the door.

          You look healthy, yeah you look

Laura's mother starts to close the door. Laura backs away.

Laura fishes the stiff envelope out of her pocket and
advances on the screen door again, holding it out.

<b>                    LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>          So, I did it. I took the test and--

Laura's mother slams the door. Laura stands on her tiptoes
and yells at the diamond shaped window.

<b>                    LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>          I got my GED!

The lock on the door snaps into place. Renewed barking from
across the street. Silence from the door. Laura brushes a
fist across her eyes and stuffs the envelope into the
mailbox.

               you.

     Laura backs off the porch and starts down the walkway. She
     stops halfway and bounds back onto the porch. She yanks the
     envelope out of the mailbox and jams it into her pocket.
     Laura storms off the porch and out of yard, never looking
     back.

     Alike is asleep on the bed. Bina cleans up feverishly,
     "accidentally" bumping Alike awake. Alike yawns and rolls

     hamper, and then begins making the bed with Alike still in
     it. Alike pulls Bina down beside her.

Alike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it
around on the bed. Bina recoils and snatches it away.
Recognition seeps across Alike's pained face. Bina moves away
from the bed and turns her back on Alike.

Alike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on.
She pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a
sweatshirt down over her nightie. She flings her backpack
open on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering
her things. Alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an
armful of toiletries, dumping them in the bag. Bina watches
her, arms folded. Alike takes one last look around the room
and heads for the door, running a sleeve across her face.

     She kicks over a cluster of garbage cans and cyclones out
     into the street, narrowly missing getting hit by a car. She
     continues her zag to the other sidewalk, her pace quickening.
     She rips open her backpack and launches a baseball cap into
     the air. She tears a handful of wifebeaters from the bag and
     flings them into the street. Spinning and thrashing she
     wrenches out a football jersey and jams it into another
     garbage can. She circles back and kicks the can over. She
     hurtles her backpack into the trees like a discus and sheds
     her hoodie like a skin before disappearing into the scream of

     Audrey melts back against the doorjamb. Alike slings off her
     shirt and slams the door in Audrey's face. A livid Audrey
     bangs on the door and jiggles the handle.

     Alike attacks her closet, ripping all the "girly" shirts from
     the hangers and hurling them toward a small vanity trashcan.
     She plunges back in and slams an armful of blouses to the
     floor. She launches a pair of pumps into the wall, followed
     by a chunky pair of Timberlands. Silent sobs rack her body as
     she tears off her own shirt and slings it at the mirror. She
     strips off her jeans and kicks them brutally into a corner.
     Alike considers her unclothed form in the mirror before
     collapsing onto the bed. She writhes against the pillows and
     covers her eyes with her elbow as darts of grief twist
     through her body. Blackout.

     Alike jerks awake in her bed, a pillow pulled down around her
     ears. The sound of a muffled argument leaks from her
     parents's bedroom. The shouting gets louder, and Alike sits
     upright in her bed as her father's footsteps boom past her
     doorway and into the living room. Audrey's voice trails him
     down the hallway, and Alike scrambles into a t-shirt and
     shorts.

Arthur spasms as though he's been stabbed. Out of nowhere,
Audrey's backhand pistons Alike to the ground. She raises her
hand high and slaps it down hard on Alike's shoulders and
arms. Alike yells. Arthur turns to stone.

Alike fends off Audrey's blows with her hands. She kicks
angrily as Audrey towers over her.

Audrey's blows become more manic and vicious. Arthur wakes
from his trance and tries to wrestle Audrey off of Alike.

Alike's head snaps back and hits the floor.

     a foil-covered plate, dumps its contents into the trash can

     table. Audrey's make-up fails to cover the dark circles
     beneath her eyes and Arthur has a week's worth of stubble.
     There is a jagged hole where Alike usually sits. Noticing
     the asymmetry, Audrey bundles up Alike's place setting and
     sweeps it onto the floor. Sharonda looks from Audrey to
     Arthur then into her plate.

<b>                         AUDREY
</b>               You want to say grace?

     Arthur clears his throat.

<b>                         ARTHUR
</b>               Heavenly Father...

     Audrey thrusts her hands out to Arthur and Sharonda.   They
     each take her hand and Arthur begins again.

<b>                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)

               pray... we pray for your continued
               blessing...

     Arthur stops talking but his head remains bowed. An awkward
     silence ensues. Audrey and Sharonda look up at him still
     holding hands.

     Audrey switches to an overly cheery auto-pilot mode, babbling
     to no one in particular.

     Sharonda, staring at her father doesn't reach for the bowl.

     Alike and Laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart
     of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Sunset paints the cityscape
     pink and orange. The faint cadence of children playing drifts
     in and out on a fickle breeze. Alike's wounds are healing and
     she seems happy. The friends exchange wordless smiles and
     soak in the peacefulness around them.

     Laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate.
     Arthur is standing in the doorway. Laura calls out to Alike.
     Alike looks up and the smile fades from her face. Arthur
     tries to move around Laura, but Laura stares him down. Laura
     looks back at Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods.
     Laura steps out of the way and watches Arthur pass.

     Alike rises to face her father. She stands tall, her weight
     is centered. Arthur struggles to find her eyes, and she turns
     away from him. Distant playground voices fill the pause.

     Alike sits at the edge of the roof writing in her notebook.
     Laura swings open the door and Alike looks back in greeting,
     her smile fading as Arthur appears behind her. Laura motions
     to Alike. Alike considers, then carefully nods. Laura steps
     aside and watches Arthur pass.

     Alike wanders to the edge of the roof, Arthur follows.
     Distant playground voices fill the pause.

Alike shakes her head and peers into the rusty skyline.
Arthur slumps his hands in his pockets and edges closer.

Alike makes no sign.

          you thought they were alive. You'd
          get so scared. You'd cry and you'd
          scream and beg for us to pick you

Arthur is silent beneath the weight of his memory. He dares a
glance over at Alike.

     Audrey is cleaned up, well-dressed and freshly put together.
     She sits alone at the lunch table, crunching an apple. A
     bible and a daily devotional guide are spread open in front
     of her. Alike knocks on the glass, and Audrey looks up
     stunned. Alike comes in and sits across from her. Audrey
     glances around, concerned about passing coworkers.

     from the curb.

     Alike leans forward to keep Laura and Sharonda in sight as
     long as possible. As she faces front again, she glimpses
     Arthur, standing in the doorway of the terminal. A passing
     van blots him from view and she leans back in her seat. An
     OLD KOREAN WOMAN next to her offers her a piece of ginger
     candy. Alike pops the candy into her mouth and takes a deep
     breath.

     Reflections of the retreating city landscape replay across
     Alike's face and she is able to hold back neither the smile
     nor the tears that come.
