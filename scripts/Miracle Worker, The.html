</b>          We see three faces in lamplight, looking down. They have
          been through a long vigil and it shows in their tired eyes
          and disarranged clothing. One is a young gentlewoman with
          a sweet girlish face, KATE KELLER; the second is an elderly
          DOCTOR, stethoscope at neck, thermometer in fingers; the
          third is a gruff gentleman in his forties with chin whis-
          kers, CAPTAIN ARTHUR KELLER.

          KATE closes her eyes.
          I can tell you now, I thought she
          wouldn't,

</b>          I've brought up two of them, but
          this is my wife's first, she
          isn't battle-scarred yet.

</b>          Doctor. Will my girl be all right?

</b>          Oh, by morning she'll be knocking
          down Captain Kellerfs fences again.

<b>          KATE
</b>          Is there nothing we should do?

</b>
<b>          (JOVIAL)
</b>          Put up stronger fencing, ha?

<b>          DOCTOR
</b>          Just let her get well, she knows
          how to do it better than we do.
          These things come and go in infants,
          never know why. Call it acute
          congestion of the stomach and brain.
          KELL ? moves after the DOCTOR, we hear them off-camera;
          we see only KATE'S face hovering over us, her hand adjust-
          ing the blanket.

</b>          I'll see you to your buggy, Doctor.

</b>          0 Main thing is the fever's gone.
          I've never seen a baby, more
          vitality, that's the truth --
          Their voices and footsteps fade. KATE is bent lovingly
          over the crib, which emits a bleat; her finger is play-
          ful with the baby's face.

<b>          KATE
</b>          Hush. Don't you cry now, you've
          been trouble enough. Call it
          acute congestion, indeed, I don't
          see what's so cute about a con-
          gestion, just because it's yours?
          We'll have your father run an
          editorial in his paper, the wonders
          of modern medicine, they don't know
          what they're curing even when they
          cure it. Men, men and their battle
          scars, we women will have to --
          Helen, Helen Captain, Captain,
          will you come.

          KELLER standing lamp in hand watching the doctor's buggy
          recede in the night. Suddenly from the house behind him
          comes a knifing scream. KELLER wheels, the scream comes
          again and the CAMERA follows KELLER's run with the lamp
          across the yard.

          KELLER bursts into the bedroom where KATE is screaming
          at the crib, her look intent on the baby and terrible.

          The stairs in the Keller House. In the foreground we see
          the bannisters, in the background the wall. A shadow.of
          the erratic, staggering figure of 5 year old HELEN appears
          on the wall, moving slowly. The two Negro children
          scamper past -- their excited laughter coming to us, in
          contrast to the mute HELEN. In CU, in the FG, HELEN'S
          little hands come into the frame, grasping the bannister

          ing out, struggling, buffeted by the damp, blowing sheets,
          CRANE DOWN towards the figure. HELEN lashes out, her
          face frightened, unknowing --- she pulls down a sheet, be-
          comes tangled in its folds, almost hysterical. In the BG
          KATE comes rushing from the house -- to help her.

          There is a Christmas tree with decorations and in a WIDE
          SHOT we see HELEN, 7 years old, reaching up into tree.
          At a window we see the faces of Percy 8 years, and Martha,
          7 years, looking in. HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball
          and rips it down, shattering at her feet. CRAB IN AND
          AROUND coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS
          hands, another ball, she pulls it down. We see her face,
          blurred out, through the pine branches and needles, and
          beyond her the other children watching.

          0 a low grass sprouting up, in the BG is the Keller house
          perhaps. Going slowly across the field is the figure of
          the child HELEN, Patty Duke. From in under CAMERA comes

          The dog is a setter named BELLE, and she is sleeping. Two
          of the children are Negroes, MARTHA and PERCY. The third
          child is HELEN, quite unkempt, in body a vivacious little
          person with a fine head, attractive, but noticeably blind,
          one eye larger and protruding; her gestures are abrupt,

          0 paper-doll cutouts, and while they speak, HELEN'S hands
          thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the
          movements of their lips. The CAMERA is on this; the
          dialogue is only background.

          But HELEN is poking her fingers inside his mouth, to feel
          his tongue; he bites at them, annoyed, and she jerks them
          away. HELEN now fingers her own lips, moving them in
          imitation, but soundlessly. Again the CAMERA on this.

          HELEN nods energetically.

          Another kind of silence now, while KATE takes pins and
          buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the
          doll as eyes. KELLER stands, caught, and watches
          morosely, AUNT EV blinks and conceals her emotion by
          inspecting her dress.

          HELEN now has the doll with eyes, and cannot contain

          kisses it.

          her throat such as an animal in a trap might make; and
