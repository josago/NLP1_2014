</b>                         The HARBOR at Miami Beach fades in, 
                         providing quick views of yachts, aquaplanes, 
                         and luxurious ship-craft lying at anchor 
                         in the calm, tranquil waters of tropical 
                         Florida. This dissolves to the NAME 
                         PLATE on the side of a yacht, reading 
                         "ELSPETH II," and this in turn to a 
                         YACHT CORRIDOR where a steward is standing 
                         in front of a cabin door, near a small 
                         collapsible table upon which there is 
                         a tray of steaming food. He lifts lids 
                         and examines the contents. A heavy-set 
                         sailor stands guard near the cabin door.[1]

                         over to the window seat, while the waiters

                         the pursuing boats come near, Ellie 
                         ducks under the water again and the 
                         boats scoot right by the fisherman. 
                         Then Ellie's head bobs up; she peers 
                         ahead of her, and seeing that her pursuers 
                         have passed her, she smiles victoriously.

                         busy opening their basket of food prepared 
                         for the long journey. A surly-looking 
                         hoodlum traveling alone is slumped in 
                         his seat, his cap drawn carelessly over 
                         his eyes. The moving view passes these 
                         and other characters until it reaches 
                         one unoccupied seat in the car, unoccupied 
                         except for several bundles of newspapers.

                         and continues talking to the superintendent. 
                         A close view of PETER shows him arching 
                         his eyebrows, an amused acknowledgment 
                         of the disdainful attitude of the driver. 
                         He drops his suitcase and starts forward.

                         around them heaving a sigh of relief. 
                         Ellie flashes him a devastating look 
                         and deliberately turns her back on him. 
                         But Peter suddenly looks down toward 
                         the floor, following which a close-up 
                         AT THEIR FEET reveals that Ellie's bag 
                         on the floor annoys Peter. With his 
                         foot he slowly moves it over to her, 
                         and Ellie's foot is seen pushing it 
                         back, whereupon Peter viciously kicks 
                         it over to her side again. Next we see 
                         Ellie glaring at him, picking up her 
                         bag, and standing on the seat depositing 
                         it on the rack overhead. But just then 
                         the bus starts forward with a lurch 
                         which unbalances her, and she falls 
                         backward right in Peter's lap. Their 
                         noses almost touch. Their eyes meet, 
                         and they glare at each other hostilely. 
                         Ellie quickly scrambles off and gets 
                         back in her seat, turning her back on 
                         him.

                         the direction of Ellie. And a view, 
                         from his angle, reveals Ellie in the 
                         shadow of the bus, her bag at her feet. 
                         She slowly turns her head toward Peter 
                         and then quickly averts it.

</b>                         PETER (seen close) speculates about 
                         her. He glances around the place, and 
                         the scene moves about, following his 
                         gaze. It takes in the other passengers, 
                         all obviously poor and uncultured. The 
                         moving view reaches Ellie. The contrast 
                         is perceptible. Thereupon, we see Peter 
                         reacting with comprehension: No doubt 
                         about it! She doesn't belong with these 
                         passengers. Then suddenly he sees something 
                         which startles him, and we see what 
                         it is: Directly in back of her, the 
                         young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts 
                         her overnight bag from the ground and 
                         starts running with it. Ellie is oblivious 
                         of his actions. PETER springs forward.

                         by her, and this amazes her even more. 
                         She shrugs her shoulders, perplexed, 
                         and resumes her smoking. In a few seconds 
                         Peter returns, puffing breathlessly.

                         scrutinizes her, soberly and appraisingly.

                         of Peter—and is startled to find him 
                         gazing at her. She turns forward, her 
                         jaw set forbiddingly.

</b>                         The scene dissolves to the view of a 
                         ROAD. It is dawn, and in the distance, 
                         against the horizon, the bus, a mere 
                         speck, makes its lone way over the deserted 
                         country. This dissolves to a large SIGN, 
                         reading "JACKSONVILLE," and then into 
                         the BUS affording a close view of ELLIE 
                         and PETER. They are both asleep, her 
                         head resting comfortably on his shoulder, 
                         Peter's topcoat thrown over her. Then 
                         the view draws back. The bus is empty 
                         except for Ellie and Peter, the last 
                         few passengers are just leaving.

</b>                         PETER's eyes slowly open. He looks down 
                         at the head on his shoulder and grins. 
                         With a sigh, he shuts his eyes again 
                         and resumes his slumber. Next, at the 
                         front of the bus, the DRIVER stands 
                         staring at Peter and Ellie in this intimate 
                         position and his mouth twists knowingly.

                         to recall where she is. Apparently she

                         and she lifts her head. Finally (in 
                         a scene including Peter), Ellie realizes 
                         that she has been sleeping on his shoulder, 
                         whereupon she straightens up, embarrassed.

                         right from the start, you're the spoiled 
                         brat of a rich father. The only way 
                         you can get anything is to buy it. Now 
                         you're in a jam and all you can think 
                         of is your money. It never fails, does 
                         it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? 
                         No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred 
                         to you to just say, "Please mister, 
                         I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; 
                         that'd bring you down off your high 
                         horse for a minute. Let me tell you 
                         something; maybe it'd take a load off 
                         your mind. You don't have to worry about 
                         me. I'm not interested in your money 
                         or your problems. You, King Westley, 
                         your father, you're all a lot of hooey 
                         to me.

                         People scurry around to get into the

                         BUS, which is practically filled. Peter 
                         is in his seat, reading a magazine, 
                         while Ellie enters hurriedly from the 
                         rear door and starts forward. As she 
                         approaches Peter, she hesitates a second, 
                         and deliberately passes him, plunking 
                         herself into a seat in the opposite 
                         aisle. Peter turns just as she gets 
                         seated. He glances at her indifferently.

                         to a man who sits reading a newspaper 
                         which covers his face. Her eyes are 
                         fixed forward, her lips set adamantly. 
                         A close-up of the MAN next to Ellie 
                         makes it plain that he is a typical 
                         drummer.[3] At the moment he is absorbed 
                         in a serial story, but suddenly he becomes 
                         aware of something at his feet, and 
                         without lowering the newspaper, his 
                         gaze slowly shifts downward. At this, 
                         the view moves down until it reaches 
                         Ellie's trim ankles. Her feet beat a 
                         regular tattoo on the floor; her extreme 
                         agitation is evident. The view moves 
                         back slowly, taking in Ellie's shapely 
                         leg as far as the knee. Then we see 
                         ELLIE and the DRUMMER as his gaze is 
                         still fixed on her leg. Slowly his face 
                         breaks into a lascivious grin, he lowers 
                         his paper, and turns for a scrutiny 
                         of her face. What he sees apparently 
                         delights him, for he drops his paper 
                         completely—and smiles broadly.

                         into a dame—not a bad looker, either—but 
                         boy, was she an iceberg! Every time

                         on me. It sure looked like cold turkey 
                         for old man Shapeley. I sell office 
                         supplies, see? And this hotsy-totsy 
                         lays the damper on me quick. She don't 
                         need a thing—and if she did she wouldn't 
                         buy it from a fresh mugg like me. Well, 
                         says I to myself—Shapeley, you better 
                         go to work. You're up against a lulu. 
                         Well, I'm here to tell you, sister, 
                         I opened up a line of fast chatter that 
                         had that dame spinnin' like a Russian 
                         dancer. Before I got through she bought 
                         enough stuff to last the firm a year. 
                         And did she put on an act when I blew 
                         town!

                         and has divided her attention between 
                         glancing back at Peter and staring at 
                         Shapeley as if he were insane—none of 
                         which bothers Shapeley. He goes on with 
                         his merry chatter, blowing rings of 
                         smoke in the direction of the ceiling.

</b>                         The scene dissolves to DYKE'S AUTO CAMP. 
                         Ellie stands alone on the porch of a 
                         small bungalow, sheltered from the rain. 
                         Over her head is a sign reading:

</b>                         She looks about her restlessly, giving 
                         the impression that she has been waiting 
                         for someone. Suddenly she is attracted 
                         by something and gazes in its direction. 
                         Then, as seen by Ellie in a long view, 
                         there appears, about twenty yards away, 
                         a small cabin, lighted on the inside; 
                         and from it Peter emerges accompanied 
                         by a man—presumably Mr. Dyke. We cannot 
                         hear what is being said; from their 
                         movements, however, it is apparent that 
                         an exchange of money is taking place. 
                         Dyke waves his hand in departure and 
                         starts toward Ellie. At the same time, 
                         Peter calls to her:

</b>                         Ellie hesitates a moment, then starts 
                         toward the cabin. Now she is hurrying 
                         across the open space. En route she 
                         passes Dyke.

</b>                         Ellie keeps on running, but suddenly 
                         she stops dead and looks back at Dyke, 
                         following which a close-up of ELLIE 
                         shows her eyes opening wide with astonishment. 
                         Her impulse is to call Dyke back, to 
                         make him repeat what he said—to make 
                         certain she heard him correctly. But 
                         Dyke is gone, and she turns and glances 
                         thoughtfully in the direction of the 
                         cabin. Then slowly the corners of her 
                         mouth screw up in an attitude of cynicism. 
                         So that's it, is it! He has given her 
                         no previous evidence of being "on the 
                         make"; yet now, with the first opportunity—. 
                         Her thoughts, however, are interrupted 
                         by Peter's voice:

                         close-up view of PETER standing in the 
                         doorway of the cabin, looking toward 
                         Ellie.

</b>                         For a long moment, ELLIE is lost in 
                         speculation as to how to proceed. Then, 
                         tossing her head defiantly, with her 
                         lips set grimly, she starts toward the 
                         cabin until she reaches it, stops in 
                         the doorway and peers in. As she does 
                         this, there is a view of the inside 
                         of the CABIN, as seen by her at the 
                         door. Except for two cots on either 
                         side of the room, a few sticks of cane 
                         furniture, a small table upon which 
                         stands an oil burner for cooking, the 
                         place is barren. At the moment Peter 
                         is attaching a clothes line across the 
                         center of the room. His suitcase is 
                         already open. And now Ellie steps inside, 
                         surveying the place contemptuously. 
                         But Peter, with his back to her, is 
                         oblivious of her presence; and as he 
                         works, he hums his favorite melody. 
                         Ellie finally breaks the silence.

                         and we see, or rather sense, her dress 
                         dropping to the floor. She now stands 
                         in her chemise; this being white silk, 
                         it stands out more prominently against 
                         the darkness. She picks up the pajamas 
                         and backs into a corner, following which

                         the pajamas in front of her with one 
                         hand, with the other she slips the strap 
                         off her shoulders. She flings her "slip" 
                         over the blanket.

                         conscious of her proximity. The situation 
                         is delicate and dangerous; the room 
                         is atingle with sex. He turns his gaze 
                         toward the blanket. The view moves to 
                         the BLANKET, remaining on it a moment. 
                         It is a frail barrier. The view then 
                         moves back to Peter, whose eyes are

                         blanket, a little fearfully. She turns 
                         her head and gazes at the ceiling for 
                         a moment. Then suddenly her eyes widen—and

                         several cottages on her way to the showers. 
                         Several people stop to stare at her 
                         until she reaches her destination. There 
                         are two wooden shacks adjoining, each 
                         having a sign on them; one reads, "Showers—Men"—the 
                         other, "Showers—Women." In front of

                         at her, whereupon Ellie sticks her tongue

                         Ellie and Shapeley, who are then seen 
                         (from his angle) talking. Thereupon 
                         PETER is seen again as his lip curls 
                         up a little jealously; he returns to 
                         the cabin, following which we again 
                         see Ellie and Shapeley walking. He notices 
                         the robe she is wearing, and he looks 
                         down toward her feet, the view moving 
                         down to show Ellie's legs and feet. 
                         The pajama legs are seen protruding 
                         below the robe, the cuffs of which she 
                         has turned up. Then the view moving 
                         back up to Ellie and Shapeley, he lifts 
                         her robe playfully.

                         their own way. I never have. On the 
                         contrary, I've always been told what 
                         to do and how to do it and where and 
                         with whom. Would you believe it? This

                         of game to try to outwit father's detectives. 
                         I—I did it once; actually went shopping 
                         without a body-guard. It was swell. 
                         I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't 
                         last long. They caught up with me in 
                         a department store. I was so mad I ran 
                         out the back way and jumped into the 
                         first car I saw. Guess who was in it?

                         of ruts, and at the moment wavers dangerously 
                         at an angle. The left front wheel is 
                         stuck in a deep hole, and the engine 
                         roars and clatters as the driver feeds 
                         the gas. Finally the bus moves forward, 
                         extricating the wheel; but just as it 
                         does, the right front wheel falls into 
                         another mud hole on the other side, 
                         and this time the bus seems hopelessly 
                         stuck, a close-up of the RIGHT WHEEL 
                         showing it revolving desperately, but 
                         in vain. The mud splashes in all directions, 
                         and the wheel seems to sink deeper and 
                         deeper. Thereupon this view cuts to 
                         the inside of the BUS. The bus

                         or fuss, he flops down on his bed, following 
                         which Ellie goes to her bed and lies 
                         down, too. Then a close view of ELLIE 
                         appears, and at the moment she looks 
                         far removed from the spoiled, pampered, 
                         self-reliant brat of Alexander Andrews. 
                         Instead, she is a helpless baby, clinging 
                         to Peter's protective wing. She'd be 
                         ever so grateful right now for a little 
                         civility on his part, for a little tenderness 
                         and understanding, and she glances over 
                         at him, hopefully. PETER, however, stares 
                         up at the stars, dreamily; and we then 
                         see ELLIE turning away from him, disappointed. 
                         Still, the minute Ellie turns her head, 
                         Peter looks at her out of the corner 
                         of his eye, and it's a long and steady 
                         gaze. Then suddenly he gets an idea 
                         and rises. He finds his topcoat and 
                         goes to her.

                         faces are seen in close proximity. Ellie, 
                         tremulous and fearful, has her eyes 
                         peeled on him. The situation is imminent 
                         with danger; anything is likely to happen 
                         at this moment; and she is frightened 
                         and expectant—she knows how weak she 
                         would be, if he suddenly crushed her 
                         in his arms. Peter avoids her gaze. 
                         He, too, is a bit shaky. The temptation 
                         is there and his resistance is waning. 
                         He tucks her in and quickly turns away. 
                         Ellie's eyes, however, never leave him. 
                         Immediate danger has vanished, and it 
                         leaves her a little regretful.

                         herself falling in love with someone 
                         who is practically a stranger to her,

                         both of them and we see that Peter, 
                         too, fights valiantly against a mounting 
                         interest in this girl, who epitomizes 
                         everything he dislikes. He creates the 
                         impression in the following scene that

                         to dissuade himself from something he 
                         is bound to regret. His attack on her, 
                         consequently, is overly vicious.

                         of her eye, her face expressionless. 
                         Peter continues his arm waving—but slows 
                         down like a mechanical toy which has 
                         run out. He finally gets down to just

                         and then thoroughly wearied, he flops 
                         down on a rock near Ellie.

                         which reads.

                         from his suitcase and lays them on the 
                         bed. There is a strained silence between

                         blanket. Peter remains motionless. Then 
                         a close view shows Ellie, as she gets 
                         into bed, sobbing quietly. She hides 
                         her face in the pillow to suppress her 
                         sobs. It is the first time in her life 
                         that she has been so deeply hurt. A 
                         close view next shows Peter reaching 
                         over for a cigarette, which he lights. 
                         All his movements are thoughtful, meditative. 
                         He leans back and stares at the ceiling, 
                         until we see only the cigarette in his 
                         mouth as it emits slowly rising puffs 
                         of smoke. This dissolving, the cigarette 
                         is seen to be burnt three quarters down, 
                         a long, frail ash hanging perilously 
                         on. Peter is then seen as he removes 
                         the cigarette from his mouth and crushes 
                         it in a tray. He leans back on the pillow 
                         and for a moment he is quiet. Then glancing 
                         over in Ellie's direction, he calls 
                         to her:

                         and peers over it. She is asleep. Her 
                         tear-stained face rests on the pillow, 
                         her arm extends over her head. It is 
                         a childlike posture.

                         whether to awaken her and decides against 
                         it. He starts away. Peter tiptoes around 
                         the room for a few moments, deep in 
                         thought. Then as an idea which he has 
                         been turning over in his mind begins 
                         to take form, he hastily begins dressing.

                         the door when he thinks of something. 
                         He turns back, grabs his suitcase, stops 
                         to throw a kiss to Ellie, and goes out 
                         into the night. Thereupon the scene

                         of astonishment and bewilderment in 
                         his eyes. Slowly he turns his head forward, 
                         staring ahead of him blankly; he can't 
                         quite make it out. Then gradually the 
                         significance of it all strikes him—and 
                         his mouth curls up bitterly.

                         my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, 
                         statesmen, foreign ministers—some of 
                         the most powerful people in the world—but

                         her. She's been too much for me. I'm 
                         glad you think it's easy.

                         a beach. The title over the picture 
                         reads: "Where they met." The second 
                         picture shows them in the cockpit of 
                         a plane, the heading reading: "Where 
                         they romanced." The next picture is 
                         of a small frame house with a shingle 
                         on it reading: "Justice of the Peace." 
                         Over the photograph is a caption: "Where 
                         they were married." The next picture 
                         is of the Andrews Yacht, and the title 
                         reads: "Where she was taken." Finally, 
                         the view moves down to the bottom of 
                         the page to a picture of Ellie and King, 
                         with her father between them, in front 
                         of Sheriff's office. Caption reads: 
                         "Where love triumphed." Over these pictures 
                         the phone bell has been ringing.

                         a dozen men and holding a cocktail in

                         frustrated, looks at her helplessly. 
                         Thereupon the scene dissolves to a full 
                         view of the LAWN. The orchestra is playing 
                         Mendelssohn's Wedding March. The lawn 
                         is crowded with guests. In the background 
                         we see the autogyro idling. A closer 
                         view shows a small platform, serving 
                         as an altar. Over it there is an arbor 
                         of roses. Back of the altar stands a 
                         minister, ready. A reverse view reveals 
                         a long, narrow, carpeted pathway leading 
                         to the house. Both sides are lined with 
                         guests, who are murmuring excitedly. 
                         At the moment, King Westley and his 
                         best man are marching solemnly toward 
                         the altar. Back of the altar we see 
                         a high platform upon which are several 
                         newsreel men who are grinding their 
                         cameras.

</b>                         The guests, of whom close glimpses are 
                         caught, are now peering over each other's 
                         shoulders. King and his best man have 
                         reached the altar, and the music of 
                         the wedding march comes to a stop. The 
                         orchestra leader is looking around, 
                         apparently waiting for a signal. At 
                         the DOOR of the HOUSE a very "prissy" 
                         middle-aged man waves his handkerchief 
                         and nods his head to the orchestra leader. 
                         The orchestra leader acknowledges the 
                         signal by nodding his head—turns to 
                         his men—waves his baton, and the orchestra 
                         starts playing, "Here Comes the Bride."—The 
                         guests whisper to each other excitedly. 
                         A great deal of stirring takes place.

                         a parade of small flower girls emerges. 
                         They march, taking each step carefully, 
                         while they strew flowers along the path. 
                         They are well out of the way when Ellie, 
                         on the arm of her father, appears in 
                         the doorway. A view of the guests shows 
                         that they cannot contain themselves. 
                         Murmurs of "Here she comes," and "Doesn't 
                         she look beautiful?" are heard. The 
                         newsreel men on their platform behind 
                         the altar bestir themselves. This is

</b>                         The scene moves to the cabin occupied 
                         presumably by Peter and Ellie. The windows 
                         are lighted. There is a blast from a 
                         trumpet, and as the lights go out a 
                         blanket is seen dropping to the floor, 
                         and the scene fades out.
