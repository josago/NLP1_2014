</b><b>          EXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A small caveman community made up of five large caves, all
          facing out towards a crackling fire.
<b>          
</b>          Slack-jawed, yet strong and confident CAVEMEN stumble about,
          dragging haunches of meat, pounding the dirt with sticks,
          dragging the women.
<b>          
</b>          WE PAN OVER to a small cave. Not even really a cave at all,
          but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in.
          Stepping out of this "cave" is a small, weak, nerdy-looking
          caveman.
<b>          
</b>          The chief caveman, set apart by the large mallet he wields,
          steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the
          beginning of a caveman meeting.
<b>          
</b>          "Loser caveman" steps forward apprehensively, only to be met
          with laughter from the other cavemen. "Loser caveman" sighs
          and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them
          from the shadows.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
</b>                        (grunting; subtitled)
                    Me see beast today. Beast scary.
                    Beast danger for caveman.
<b>          
</b>          The rest of the cavemen look nervous.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
</b>                    If caveman kill beast? Caveman
                    safe. Caveman have food.
<b>          
</b>          The cavemen grunt in understanding.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
</b>                    Who kill beast?
<b>          
</b>          The cavemen grunt amongst themselves. The toughest of the
          bunch steps forward, pounds his chest and grunts.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
</b>                    Grob kill beast. Good Grob.
<b>          
</b>          The chief notices "loser caveman" watching from a distance.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHIEF CAVEMAN

<b>          
</b>          All the cavemen turn and laugh at the "loser caveman".
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHIEF CAVEMAN

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          All the cavemen laugh hysterically.

</b><b>                              CAVEMAN #3
</b>                    Fuck that guy!
<b>          
</b>          All the cavemen pick up rocks and begin throwing them at the
          "loser caveman", who dives out of his cave and runs around
          the camp, dodging their blows.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Everyone in the village is asleep. Everyone, that is, but
          "loser caveman" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little
          cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable.
<b>          
</b>          A stirring in the trees causes "loser caveman" to sit
          upright. There's something outside of the village. Something
          big.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly a GIANT TUSKED BOAR pushes through the trees and
          stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the
          village fire.
<b>          
</b>          "Loser caveman" is practically shaking with fear. The boar
          makes eye-contact with "loser caveman" and charges directly
          towards his tiny little cave.
<b>          
</b>          The giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the
          opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside.
          "Loser caveman" screams like a girl.
<b>          
</b>          The boar backs up to strike again -- this one sure to be the
          end of "loser caveman" -- when a large boulder, knocked loose
          by the Boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the
          Boar's head, killing it instantly.
<b>          
</b>          The entire village runs out to see what has happened. The
          "Loser caveman" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself
          off.
<b>          
</b>          The chief steps forward.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHIEF CAVEMAN

                    Look he scared!
<b>          
</b>          Everyone laughs. The Chief looks towards Loser, standing
          nervously near the corpse of the Giant Tusked Boar.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHIEF CAVEMAN

<b>          
</b>          Everyone laughs hysterically. WE PAN over the many laughing
          faces, pointing and hooting at loser caveman's cowardice. We
          watch as the "loser caveman's" face turns bright red, the
          veins in his neck pop out and his fists clench up tightly.
<b>          
</b>          SUDDENLY WE FLY into the caveman's skull, traveling through
          his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his
          small, homo erectus brain. Sparks are flying back and forth
          across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession.
<b>          
</b>          There is a SMALL EXPLOSION.
<b>          
</b>          We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face
          contorted in rage.
<b>          
</b>          He interrupts everyone's laughter.
<b>

</b>          Loser caveman stands up straight and tall -- all of a sudden
          the Bruce Willis of cavemen.

</b>                      That lowly caveman who stumbled

                    Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early
                    and not really looking forward to
                    tonight in general, but the thought
                    of being alone the rest of my life
                    scares both my mother and I
                    equally.

                    I have an erection now because I

                    I'm embarrassed because I think the
                    restaurant I've made reservations
                    at might not be expensive enough or
                    hip enough to impress you, but it
                    was the best I could do because I
                    don't make very much money. You
                    see, I'm forty years old and have
                    no real financial assets to speak
                    of, I've never owned a home, and
                    never had a significant
                    relationship. My boss even told me
                    today that I'm most likely going to
                    get fired tomorrow and...

                    In fact, I think my best trait is
                    the fact that I've made very few
                    mistakes: socially, academically,
                    financially or romantically. I take
                    very few risks and therefore lead a
                    relatively happy and light-hearted
                    existence. Mostly though, I'm a
                    kind, sweet person with the
                    potential of genuinely becoming a
                    vital and interesting human being
                    the day I take the energy I expend
                    on hyper self-reflexivity and apply
                    it to actual action in the reality

          uninspired and completely furnished by the cheapest stuff
          found in an IKEA catalogue.

</b><b>                              JIM
</b>                    Hi, I'm Jim and I'm the
                    spokesperson for the Coca-Cola
                    company. I'm here today to ask you
                    to continue buying coke. I'm sure
                    it's a drink you've been drinking
                    for years, and if you still enjoy
                    it, I'd like to remind you to buy
                    it again sometime soon. It's
                    basically just brown sugar water,
                    we haven't changed the ingredients
                    much lately, so there's nothing new
                    about it I can say. We changed the
                    can around a little bit. See, the
                    colors here are a little different,
                    and we even put a polar bear on it
                    for the kids. Also, coke is very
                    high in sugar, can lead to obesity
                    in children and adults who don't
                    sustain a healthy diet, and has a
                    Ph acidity level high enough to
                    dissolve teeth and bones over
                    extended periods of time. Coke also
                    works great at removing corrosion
                    from car batteries and loosening
                    rusted bolts. So that's it, it's
                    coke. Everyone knows it. It's very
                    famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke,
                    and I'm asking you to not stop
                    buying coke. That's all. Thanks.

          at him. There is a whispered hubbub from the many cubicles
          and offices.
<b>          
</b>          Mark passes his old office, stopping to read the sign on the
          door: "14TH CENTURY -- CLOSED."

                    all the way out of town. And then I
                    walked into the desert and I fell
                    asleep under a tree.

                    strange old chest sticking out of
                    the ground. So I started digging.
                    And I unearthed a very old and
                    ancient box. Probably, oh...
                    about... seven hundred years old.
                    And inside the box...

</b>          Mark places his muddy, dirty, manuscript down on Anthony's
          desk. Anthony is scared to touch it.

                    fourteenth century, a momentous
                    occasion occurred. It began as a
                    day much like any other. The sun
                    rose, the people awoke, workers
                    began to work, babies began to cry.
                    But all of that was interrupted
                    when a giant flying space ship
                    crashed down from the skies and
                    landed in the heart of Babylon.

                    mind-wipe on all of the humans,

                    someone to suicide just hearing
                    about it, so I'll keep it simple.

</b>                    I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want
                    to die. You know, people don't talk
                    about it much, but death is a
                    horrible thing. One minute you're
                    alive, there's a whole world around
                    you, humming and jumping, people
                    coming in and out, doors opening
                    and closing, love and anger and the
                    whole mess of it all, and then like
                    that, it's all gone.
<b>                        (CRYING)
</b>                    This is it Mark, only a few hours
                    left of this until an eternity of
                    nothingness.
<b>          
</b>          The wheels in Mark's head are spinning again. Suddenly the
          heart monitor starts beating rapidly and Martha lurches in
          pain.
<b>          
</b><b>                               MARK

<b>          
</b>          Mark immediately slams on the big red "call nurse" button,
          holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain.
<b>          
</b>          Seconds later three nurses burst into the room.

<b>          
</b>          Nurse #2 begins filling a syringe. Mark sits by his
          grandmother's head, they're both looking right at each other.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          We focus on Mark and his grandmother, inches from one another
          as the paramedics busy themselves around Martha's dying body.

                    all of the people you've ever loved
                    and who have ever loved you. And
                    you're going to be young again, and
                    you'll be able to run through the
                    fields and dance and jump, and
                    there will be no sadness, no pain,
                    just love and laughing and
                    happiness. There will be ponies

                    live in giant mansions, and
                    everything will smell like cookies.

<b>          
</b>          Tears are rolling down Martha's face as a glimmering smile
          overtakes her face.
<b>          
</b>          Mark looks up to see the nurses, paramedics and doctors all
          staring at Mark in total shock.

<b>          
</b>          Mark gets out of his car to find a wild scene: hundreds of
          people camped out on the lawn of his apartment building.
<b>          
</b>          Standing by his door is the NURSE from the hospital. She
          immediately points at Mark and screams.

</b>                    My grandmother was dying, and she

                    She didn't want to just become
                    nothingness. So I told her that
                    when she died there wouldn't be
                    nothingness. That she would be with
                    all of the people she loved who had
                    died and that she would live an

</b>          CLOSE ON COKE CAN: The warning label is extremely long and
          written in very small type. It starts with, "COKE IS VERY BAD

          general health issues that coke might cause:"

          simply, "If you still want to drink Coke, do so at your own
          risk."

</b>          Mark looks over to find Greg staring at the depressing label

          hand he covers everything on the label except for "Please
          Enjoy Coke."

                    some very big news for you all
                    today.

                    the way you all do business...
                    forever.
<b>          
</b>          Mark hits a button and a projection screen comes down on the
          far wall. Mark starts a slide show.

</b>                    Up until now, all products sold
                    worldwide have warning labels
                    printed on them. Warnings like
                    these.
<b>          
</b>          SERIES OF SLIDES: We see the same warning we just saw on the
          Coke can, a commercial jet with "This Plane Might Crash --
          Four Of Our Other Ones Did" printed on its side, a car
          dashboard light reading "This Car will Ignite Upon Impact -
          Always", and a sticker on a grocery store package of ground
          meat that reads "Injected with hormones that make it taste
          better -- but will eventually give you cancer".

</b>                    As you can see, a lot of these
                    products can be very depressing.
                    They remind people of all the
                    horrible things that can happen to
                    them in life. People hate thinking
                    about horrible things.

</b>                    Nothing's really changed. I gave
                    people the Man in the Sky, made
                    myself rich and successful, told
                    the world they can eat whatever
                    they want and feel good about it.
                    Everyone's happy but me. Because
                    I'm the only one who knows it
                    all... isn't. I made it all up.

                    ground. That's all. And I'm the
                    only one who knows that.
<b>                        (PAUSE)
</b>                    And the one thing I want I can't
                    have. Because the world is too
                    stupid to change. The world only
                    cares about what they can see, and
                    what they can know, and what
                    they're used to and what... makes
                    sense. No one listens to what they
                    really want. And that's why I'll
                    always just be a loser, grandma.
                    And that's why I'll always be
                    alone.
