</b>          Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go
          the other way.

<b>          
</b>          Tom walks a few more steps.
<b>          
</b>          And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even
          noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED
<b>          HIM INTO A KISS!
</b><b>          
</b>          It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure
          if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out
          of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually
          happening.

          down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes,
          winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out
          his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.
<b>

          loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom
          singing the song.

</b>          Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also
          pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last
          night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up
          every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean".

          gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make
          anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal
          for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it.
          Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world.

                      I kinda like what Nietzsche said:
                      "There is always some madness in
                      love, but there is also...always
                      some reason in madness." Think
                      about it. Pretty smart. Although,
                      Nietzsche also said "Kill the
                      Jews." So there's that.

</b>                    I think we do a bad thing here.
                    People should be able to say how
                    they feel, how they really feel,
                    without some strangers putting
                    words in their mouths. The truth. A
                    card is a nice thought but it
                    shouldn't do the dirty work for
                    you. You love someone, tell them
                    yourself, in your own words. Maybe
                    it's not love at all. Maybe there's
                    no such thing as love. Maybe
                    it's... "galoogoo."

</b>          LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we
          first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while
          holding a phone with the other.

</b><b>          
</b>          Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,
          reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building
          design.

</b><b>          
</b>          Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing
          soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
          his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
          futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and
          Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also
          crossed off.

</b><b>          9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,
          crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He
          sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
          in thought.

          he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.

</b><b>          
</b>          Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal
          interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In
          the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took
          Summer ages ago.

<b>          
</b>          Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She
          may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.
          Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to
          do.

</b>                    One day I'm reading a book at the
                    corner deli and this guy sits down
                    and starts asking about it. Now
                    he's my husband!

</b><b>                               SUMMER
</b>                    What would have happened if I went
                    to the movies instead? If I went
                    somewhere else for lunch? If I
                    showed up to eat ten minutes later?
                    Tom, it was meant to be, just like
                    you said. And as it was happening,
                    I knew it. I could feel it, sure as
                    the sun. And I kept thinking to
                    myself "Holy shit. Tom was right."
                    You were right about all of it.

</b>                    It just wasn't me you were right
                    about.
<b>          
</b>          Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her
          wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact
          shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a
          few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.

</b>                    Anyway, I should probably be

                    you. I'm glad you're well.

          for the last time ever.

</b><b>                                 TOM

          Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every
          second.

          They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's
          during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we
          can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
          girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her.
          And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.
