<b>          EXT. FITZGERALD HOME -- NIGHT
</b>
          The house is dark. The moon is almost full. A dog barks.
          A melancholy voice, worn for its age, narrates:
          BRIGITTE (V/o)
          Ever try bein' different? An, I
          don't mean jus' thinkin' about
          it, either. Ginger an' me - I
          mean I...
          The house numbers read 669. The 9 slips: the number now
          reads 666.

<b>          BRIGITTE (CON'T/V/O)
</b>          Ginger an' I? Went for different.
          Big time.
          There's a light on in a basement window. We creep up to it,
          crushing the tulip. borders on the way. The window is propped
          open with a sneaker: it looks like somebody's foot is caught
          in it. Music plays inside-

<b>          INT. GIRLS' BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Gyrating in her underwear to bad-girl grunge, BRIGITTE
          FITZGERALD (15) straddles GINGER FITZGERALD (also 15 and in
          underwear) on one of the twin single beds. Both girls have
          cigarettes lolling on their lower lips. Both girls have
          pierced eyebrows, pierced noses and streaked hair. Brigitte
          has blue nail polish on. Ginger has breasts.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Brigitte. Quit dickin' around.
          Jus' do it.
          Brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton
          ball in rubbing alcohol.
          Without looking up from her TANK GIRL comic, Ginger hauls her
          own shirt up to expose her navel.
          Brigitte swabs Ginger's navel with the wet cotton ball. Her
          eyes drift to Ginger's chest, then back to what she's doing.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          Ginger's ten months older than
          me. we're seriously tight. Share
          everything. Everything.
          Around them, many candles burn. There's a dead bolt on the
          door. An attached full bath. The floors are thick with
          paranormal books. The walls are covered in images of UFO's
          and horror flicks. A framed photo of Kurt Cobain with
          Courtney Love has a place of honor. There's an old Polaroid
          of the girls at five in Halloween costumes; Lill Red Riding
          Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. Ginger is the wolf.
          Brigitte produces an enormous darning needle. It glints. she
          levels it at Ginger's navel, her hand shaking.

<b>          BR IG ITTE
</b>          Ready?

<b>          GINGER
</b>          (without looking up)
          Uh-huh.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          .I can't.
          Ginger gives Brigitte a look over the top of her comic.
          Brigitte takes a deep breath, and lines the needle up again.
          Brigitte swallows hard and applies pressure. The needle
          pierces Ginger's skin. Her stomach muscles flinch.

<b>          GINGER
</b>
<b>          OUCH!
</b>
<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          You said it wouldn't hurt!

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Jus' hurry up!
          The needle has stopped moving half-way through the skin.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Uh-oh .
          Brigitte wiggles the needle. Blood wells up around it.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Um. I think it's stuck. Oh man.
          There's blood...
          Ginger lowers her comic. she takes one look at the needle
          half-.in, half-out of her belly button - and cracks up.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          snot funny, Ginger!
          Laughing her head off, Ginger gives the needle a good tug
          from her end. The skin tugs with it, resisting.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Ali, gawd, gross.
          Ginger yanks the needle, hard. This time it moves.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          I got it, I got it.
          Ginger grits her teeth. The needle begins a slow progress.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          It's goin', it's goin'- gimme
          the ring
          Brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but
          knocks it to the floor. Brigitte scrambles after it. Ginger
          yanks the needle.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Bee?! C'mon!
          Brigitte finds the ring and hands it to Ginger. Ginger sets
          the ring on the end of the needle, looping it not-so-neatly
          through.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Oh, groo-oo-o-ss!
          The bloody needle pops clear. Ginger grinds on the ring to
          close it. Ginger wipes her bloody hands on the bed. Brigitte
          is taking deep, gulping breaths.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Bee? Feeb. Y'okay?

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Yeah. I think so.

<b>          GINGER
</b>
<b>          (TEASING)
</b>          Yeah, I think not.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          If you din't say it hurt, I'd a
          been fine!
          Ginger beams at her new piercing.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Pretty cool, unh?
          The flesh around the navel is hot pink and bruising. Brigitte
          grins too.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          very cool.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Now I'll do you.
          Brigitte bravely hangs onto to her smile.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          We do everything together. But,
          at fifteen? A chick can change.
          Ya know?
          [3A! You got no idea.

<b>          EXT. THE FTTZGERALD BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
          It's a beautiful autumn day in suburbia. Birds sing. The
          terrier next door (NORMAN) barks and barks.
          A pierced navel is stretched taught, filling with blood.
          Ginger's limp body is bent backward over a low fence. Blood
          is flowing from where she's been speared through her chest:
          Ginger's impaled on a white picket.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          Don't get me wrong. It's not
          like we were all happy or
          nothin' to begin with.
          Brigitte takes a long, ponderous drag on her cigarette as -
          unmoved - she takes in Ginger's mortal wound. Brigitte eyes
          the identical homes and gardens that stretch on to the
          horizon.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          The suburb of Bailey Downs?
          Basically a well lit black hole.
          The Kingdom of cul du sac.
          That's French for Dead End.
          Brigitte flicks her smoke into a pile of neatly raked leaves.
          It smolders then goes out. She scowls.

          out here? Life bit the big one.
          A truck with COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM on its side pulls up a
          few houses over. Brigitte watches a shirtless sun-bronzed
          Adonis - SAM -- climb out of the cab.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          Of course I'm generalizing.
          A tarty teenage girl - TRINA - bounds up to Sam and gives him
          a big wet one.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/0)
</b>          No I'm not.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          The fuck, Bee. Take a picture
          already.
          Brigitte raises a 35mm still camera to her eye and frames her
          sister's corpse in the viewfinder.

          The Fitzgerald sisters stand over a slide projector in art
          class, just finishing the slide show from the credit
          sequence. An empty frame of blinding white light snaps onto
          the collapsible screen at the front of the room.
          The homely ART TEACHER looks very concerned as she hits the
          lights. The other STUDENTS â€¢-- all about fifteen, middle-class
          and raging conformists -- sit in stunned silence. As Brigitte
          and Ginger return to their side-by-side seats,

          freaks. For as long as I can
          remember, there was Us. And
          there was Them. Like from
          kindergarten.

<b>          ART TEACHER
</b>          Very -um. Class? Comments?
          The students trade constipated looks.

<b>          ART TEACHER
</b>          Brigitte. What does it mean for
          you?
          Brigitte shrugs and squirms.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Means there's more to life than
          -- well, li.fe.
          The Fitzgeralds look expectantly at row after row of blank
          faces. Brigitte shakes her head.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          Attempts at communication wore
          futile.
          JASON McCARDY- a good-looking high school Casanova - looks
          Ginger over appraisingly. Ginger ignores him.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          Some of Them did seem to wanna
          reach Ginger?
          Brigitte glances from Ginger's breasts to her own flat chest.
          Brigitte takes a deep breath.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          But nobody wanned to reach me.
          The bell goes.

</b>
          TEENS clog the halls. Judging by the herd, Bailey High is not
          big on individual identity, or at least its outward
          expression.
          Ginger and Brigitte slip down the crowded corridors, sticking
          out like sore thumbs. Ginger holds her forehead.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Gawd, People! They hurt my
          brain!

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          They didn't even get it.

</b>          They're retards.

</b>          They're cretins.

          The girls stop before their locker. A folded up piece of
          loose leaf has been crushed into it, its end sticking out.

          Ginger opens the locker. She unfolds the paper. There's a big
          fat joint inside, and a note that says: GINGER, CALL 555-

<b>          4636.
</b>          Ginger pockets the joint, crumples the paper into a ball and
          tosses it at a near-by trash can. She misses.
          The girls head down the hall..

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Somebody leaves you all. these

          A FAT JANITOR scoops up the wad of loose leaf with great
          resentment and jams it into the trash.
          Brigitte and Ginger pass a NECKING COUPLE practically dry-
          humping, GIRLS applying make-up to one another, and BOYS
          snapping each other with their sports cups.
          Jason and his fellow jock-pals TIM, FRANK, and JEREMY are
          scoping babes.
          Ginger bends to tie her boot lace and a collective groan
          swells from the guys.

<b>          JASON
</b>          See? She's weird, but hot.

<b>          TIM
</b>          Anybody poled Fitzy yet?
          Brigitte gives them a disgusted look.

<b>          TIM
</b>          Not that one. The cute one.
          Brigitte's face falls. Ginger gives them a Death Stare. The
          boys try flirty smiles.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          (to Brigitte)
          Sad. Must be hard to think with
          yer brains slappin' around yer
          thighs like that all day.
          Brigitte laughs. Ginger pulls her on, past a sign: GYMNASIUM.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          We didn't do guys. Guys were too
          gross. Everyone at Bailey High
          was just too incredibly gross.
          Ginger applies her boot to a swinging door and they enter,

          The Fitzgeralds stop dead. They take in a menagerie of 90210-
          wanna-be GIRLS changing for gym class. The background chat is
          all sex and mascara.
          There is only one free spot: next to Trina and her TRINA
          CLONES. The Trinas slide into a-size-too-small shorts while
          parading hefty chests. The Trina acts like she owns the
          goddamn planet.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          The only thing worse than most
          teenage boys are most teenage
          girls. Trinas are the limit.
          Ginger digs at her lower abdomen painfully.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          I feel sick.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Me too.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          No, J. mean really.
          Gingler opens a locker and tears off her clothes. Other girls
          glance at her navel piercing with disgust..
          Brigitte is very self-conscious: she steps almost inside the
          locker, hiding behind the door while she changes into the
          revolting school gym outfit. She eyes the buxom bubble heads
          with contempt, as

<b>          BRI.GITTE (V/O)
</b>          There was really only one Trina,
          but they were all the same.
          Trina finds the Fitzgeralds' open locker door a nuisance.
          She pushes it out of her way, hard enough to whack Brigitte
          in the head on the other side.

<b>          TRINA
</b>
<b>          (FAKELY)
</b>          Ooops. Sorry.
          Ginger gives Trina a very dirty look. Brigitte tries to rub
          her sore head while clutching her uniform to cover her chest.
          Trina and her posse cackle as they prance out, their butt
          cheeks waggling. The sisters continue changing.

          until she's like shredded to a
          bazillion pieces from the inside
          out...
          Ginger grips her sides painfully and bends double.

</b>          I got gas...Maybe I'll try an,

          They slap hands, laughing. They look down at their gym
          outfits, which are SO unflattering. Brigitte and Ginger
          exchange identical looks of agony.

<b>          EXT. BAILEY HIGH SPORTS FIELD - DAY
</b>
          The twenty or so participants in this all-girl gym class
          stand ready at centre field in lacrosse padding and helmets.
          Brigitte and Ginger stand apart from the others, sharing a
          smoke. Brigitte looks scared. Ginger looks ill.

          The gym teacher. M7.,. SYKES - an aging former-traffic cop -
          hucks the players sticks with nets on one end. Sykes is given
          to screaming.

          lacrosse scrimmage begins.

          sticks and bodies, pushed, kicked, and punished by the

          IN RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE: Brigitte visibly cowers as a tangle of
          marauding, ball-whacking bodies descend on her. She takes a
          number of direct hits from the hard rubber ball.
          on a powerful press for a goal, Trina slams into Brigitte so
          hard Brigitte flies right out of the net area. And skids
          face-first .into a mangled dog's body.
          The whistle blows and play stops. Ginger lopes over,
          breathless, gripping her sore stomach.

          The proper form of protection is
          a personal choice, and may have
          a lot to do with your menstrual
          flow, which naturally changes
          during the time you'll have your
          little miracle of nature. It
          could start thick and syrupy,
          move to a straight-forward basic
          bright red bleeding and then
          perhaps a deep brownish to
          blackish slime, signaling the
          end of the flow. Twenty-eight
          days later or there abouts,
          it'll start all over again and
          continue every month until
          menopause, in about thirty
          years' time.

          doors and windows. There is an occasional FLASH! from within,
          and the whir of the Polaroid's motor.

          In the moonlight, the joint's cherry burns hell-fire red. A
          couple of Polaroid buddy-shots sit at their feet. Brigitte
          tokes and passes the jay to Ginger..

<b>          BRIGITTE

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Wish I was an unsolved mystery.
          Brigitte reflects on this heavy thought, nodding - stoned.

<b>          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT
</b>
          The girls sniff around the playhouse. Ginger steps on
          something that makes an evil squeeshy sound. She skids and
          ends up on her ass.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          This is so not my day.
          Brigitte helps her to her feet. Ginger shakes what she
          slipped on off her shoe. It's a long, ropy intestine. She
          drags her shoe to get the blood and goo of it.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Nice. Dog shit.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          (thrilled to
          recognize the smell)
          That isn't shit... it's death.
          A line of blood and gore trails across the grass to a back
          lane. Brigitte follows it. Ginger looks around for something
          on the ground.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Great. Lost the jay. Great.

<b>          EXT. SERVICE LANE - NIGHT
</b>
          Ginger joins Brigitte, who's squatted before another dog's
          body. This one's a fresh kill.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Ack, it's still warm, gross.
          Brigitte takes its picture FLASH! with the Polaroid, which is
          strung around her neck.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Why every dog but the mutt next
          door to us?

<b>           23
</b>          Ginger indicates a construction dumpster on the end of the
          lane. Disappointed, Bee rolls down her sleeves to cover her
          hands. Ginger does the same and they shovel the body onto
          their arms.
          They trot the dog over to the dumpster. Brigitte sulks.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          What.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          We never do what I wanna do.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Oh, c' mon. Would stink up the
          whole room!
          They hoist the dog up and dump it in the dumpster. It's hind
          end sticks out. Brigitte climbs into the dumpster, dragging
          it all the way in.
          Dusting herself off, Ginger notices some blood on her thigh.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Nice.
          Ginger wipes at the blood with her hand. More appears. She
          lifts up the hem of her skirt. Her face falls. She looks
          around. She slips her fingers up to her crotch. Her hand
          comes out bloody.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Bee. I JUST got the curse.
          Brigitte stops rooting garbage over the dog.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Serious?
          Ginger wiggles her wet fingers at her.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          We gotta go home.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Eeew, 'kay.
          Brigitte catches her kilt on a nail sticking out of a plank
          in the trash.
          Something is crunching through the leaves toward them. Ginger
          peers out into the darkness.

          A few homes down, a garage's motion-sensitive security lamp
          trips on. Ginger squints, blinded.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Bee?:
          Brigitte contorts to deal with the nail. Brigitte tears her
          hem free and jumps down. The light snaps off.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          (indicating the
          opposite direction)
          Let's go this way.
          Brigitte dips a hand back into the dumpster for the plank
          with the nail. Off Ginger's look, Brigitte shrugs.
          They start walking down the lane. The greenery behind them
          starts swelling again. The leaves crunch, faster.
          Brigitte and Ginger look at one another, and walk faster. The
          lane empties behind a deserted strip mall.

<b>          EXT. STRIP MALL LOT - NIGHT
</b>
          Whatever is behind them knocks an empty trash can over.
          Brigitte grabs Ginger's arm, scared.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          This is stupid. We're getting
          farther from home.
          Ginger is pissed off now. she turns to confront their
          stalker.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          (to the darkness)
          All right you ass-/
          She's cut cold by a roaring blur of speeding fur and teeth
          and claws: SOMETHING takes Ginger down hard.
          We cannot see it as a whole, we can't make out what it is.
          It's big, heavy, and raging. Immense jaws snap vicious teeth,
          going for Ginger's jugular. Brigitte drops her plank.

<b>          BRIGITTE/GINGER!!!
</b>          Brigitte grabs and kicks at the creature. Ginger raises her
          arms and covers her head, screeching and kicking. The thing
          grabs Ginger by the scruff and shakes the living daylights
          out of her.

<b>          GINGER
</b>
<b>          BEEEEEI HELP MEEE! BEEEEE!!!1!
</b>          Brigitte snatches up the plank with the nails. Brigitte
          brings it down hard on the thing, screaming. She smacks it
          once, twice. The plank pops a shot off the camera: FLASH! A
          horrible set of jaws and one golden eye are caught for a
          split second in the light.
          The third hit evokes a yelp and the thing backs off,
          snarling.. Brigitte quakes with the board raised, ready. The
          thing skitters before her as she screams.
          Ginger scrambles to her foot and grabs Bee with bloodied
          hands.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Go-go-go-go-go-go!!!!
          Brigitte drops the plank and they run like hell.. for a main
          thorough-way ahead. It pursues them.

<b>          EXT. THE THOROUGH-WAY - NIGHT
</b>
          The late-night traffic is light but consistent. The thing is
          still, coming.
          At a dead run Brigitte and Ginger sail between moving cars.
          The thing burns behind them.
          The girls are barely missed by an approaching truck. There is
          a long blast of a horn.
          Then a sickening thud. Brakes squeal incto a stop as a
          horrible dragging/ scrain fills the night air.
          The girls crash to the sidewalk, spilling over top of one
          another. They glance over their shoulders, even as they
          disappear into a new residential stretch.
          The COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM truck sits at a right angle in
          the road, it's front end smashed.

          He looks under the truck, and follows a wet trail of gore
          back behind it to the mangled furry mass about twenty feet
          back. He takes it in, stunned.
          Then Sam vomits.

          Brigitte scrambles through the window and helps Ginger
          through after her. They're bloody, sweaty and tearful. They
          slump shaking, side by side on Ginger's bed, catching their
          breath.
          Brigitte notices the rivulets of blood trickling down
          Ginger's arms. Ginger's shirt is soaking with growing red
          stains.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Ginger, shit!
          Ginger looks at herself. Ginger starts to cry.

</b>          The fuck was that, Bee?

</b>
          Brigitte flings open the vanity and collects various first
          aid items: gauze, tape, band-aids, iodine. She snags a
          washcloth and wets it at the tap.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          I couldn't remember Ginger
          crying, ever.
          Brigitte flies out to,

</b>
          where Ginger is painfully pealing off her shirt, shaking and
          sobbing.
          Brigitte offers Ginger the wet cloth, but Ginger's helpless.

</b>          Ginger, sshhh, don't, 'kay.
          Don't cry.
          Carefully, Brigitte begins to dab at Ginger's arms with it,
          wiping off the blood. Ginger flinches.
          The damage is gradually revealed: massive claw marks, deep
          scratches, and puncture wounds - BITE MARKS. Brigitte's eyes
          fill with tears.

          Brigitte starts tearing off strips of gauze and taping it on
          thick. Oblivious, Ginger fumbles for a smoke. She can't get
          the lighter to work.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Wanted to kill me! I could tell.

<b>          BRIGITTE

          Brigitte doesn't look convinced. Brigitte snaps the port of
          an internal vacuum system open and reaches into the tube.
          She withdraws a sample-size of Jack Daniels.

<b>          BRIGITTE

          Ginger glugs some down, and passes the last mouthful left to

          and shuts the door. Brigitte eyes the Polaroid camera: a
          picture sits ready to be dispensed.
          She pulls it free. We do not see the photo. Brigitte's eyes
          bug out as she examines it.
          The toilet flushes in the bathroom and Brigitte pushes the
          photo under the pillow on her bed. Shaking her head.

</b>          I woke up later, I thought the

          Brigitte peers at Ginger: she's snoring. Brigitte pulls out
          the Polaroid and fires up her lighter to see by. This time we
          see it too. A streak of fur, fangs and a golden glinting eye.

          It's noon hour. The grounds are full. of teens.
          Brigitte is eating as she ticks off the fourth day in
          Ginger's feminine hygiene calendar. Brigit:Le counts 28 days
          from the first check mark. Her pen hovers over the date:
          Halloween, arid the next full moon. The first day was a full
          moon. Brigitte slowly circles them both.
          Ginger wears long sleeves to hide her bandages, and shades.
          She's looking BOYS up and down as they pass. Ginger's stomach
          is growling. An untouched sandwich sits on her lap.

<b>          BRIGITTE

          Ginger heads off toward the boys - without waiting. Brigitte
          is in mid-,mouthful, and has to scramble to catch up.

          Jason and his pals' butcho conversation sputters as Ginger
          strides up like a cat in heat. Brigitte stumbles up behind

          Brigitte hesitates before a rusted-out old boogie van, it's
          rear door open and waiting. Blue smoke billows out. of the
          interior. Brigitte looks confused.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          I was all like, so who are you,
          an' what have you done with my

          Brigitte climbs in.

<b>          INT. VAN - DAY
</b>
          Ginger, Jason, Tim, Frank and Jeremy sit toking a gagger. The
          guys are giddy with lust. Brigitte is huddled in a corner,
          attempting invisibility.
          Jason hands Ginger the joint, making sure their fingers
          touch.

</b>          Jason and Ginger exchange a coy smile that makes Brigitte
          toke really hard on her pass.
          Brigitte passes the dube to Tim, who winks at her. Brigitte
          sneers and looks at her watch. She makes a pained face at
          Ginger, but is ignored.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          This home-grown?

<b>          JASON

<b>          JASON
</b>          Yeah, whatever.
          Brigitte gapes at Ginger, who does not respond. Brigitte
          hides beneath her hair and presses even further into a
          corner. She starts quietly ripping up the corner of the old
          shag rug.
          There is a codified knock on the vain door. Brigitte jumps.

<b>          JASON
</b>          speak of the devil. Enter!
          The back doors open and Sam (the tree planter) stands in
          silhouette, backlit by the day. His battered county truck
          waits behind him. He has a pit bull with him - MORELY.

<b>          BOYS
</b>          Sam the Man! Hey Morely!
          Sam and Morely hop in and close the doors. Brigitte is frozen
          at the sight of Sam up so close.

</b>          Whoa dude. What happened to

          Morely stomps into Brigitte's lap, sniffing her crotch.

          alone any more. Ya know, dog

          Brigitte's mouth is hanging open. Morely slobbers all over
          her hands.

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          I know, I look like an asshole.
          Ginger's perma-smug smile fades as she makes eye contact with
          Morely. Morel growls at her. Sam is about to resume his
          accident story when,

<b>          JASON
</b>          Watcha got for us?
          Sam produces several baggies of grass. Morely's hackles rise.
          Brigitte looks from the dog to Ginger, Ginger squirms.

          What's your problem? Never seen
          a pretty girl before?
          Ginger sneers at Morely and Morely bares his teeth.

<b>          JASON/TIM/FRANK

          Thanks, man.
          Morely bursts out barking and charges at Ginger.
          Mayhem as the guys try to contain the dog in the small space.
          Jason uses the opportunity to shield Ginger for a free body
          press. Brigitte gets banged and shoved.
          Ginger kicks and screams at the dog, her boot connects
          squarely with his snout. Morely keels back, and Sam snaps
          him up.

<b>          SAM
</b>          Sorry, he's not really like

          And in another flash of daylight, Sam and Morely are gone.
          Brigitte looks longingly at the closed door.
          The stone has set in, and everyone but Brigitte giggles as
          they settle. Brigitte takes in the Lesser Mortals like
          they're lepers.

<b>          JASON
</b>          You okay?

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Yeah. Just hate dogs.
          They give one another this corny smile. Brigitte bugs her
          eyes at Ginger. Ginger rises reluctantly.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Well. Thanks for the smoke.

          Ginger places a finger to her lips, then makes a finger gun
          and shoots him.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          I'll letcha know.
          Ginger grins ear-to-ear, elbowing Brigitte. Ginger kicks the
          van doors open and saunters out. Brigitte :Follows, trying not
          to laugh.

<b>          INT. SCHOOL CAN - DAY
</b>
          Brigitte stands stoned out of her bean in the girls'
          washroom. She imitates Ginger's cavalier farewell from the
          last scene.

<b>          BRIGITTE

          No answer. Brigitte squints at the tampon dispenser next to
          her. She tries to work it without putting money in. She
          smacks her dry lips. Brigitte bends over the sink and drinks
          from the tap.

          Brigitte doesn't hear her over the roar of the tap in her
          face. It shuts off automatically over her gaping mouth.
          Brigitte puts her finger up the spout and almost gets it
          stuck.

          Brigitte shuffles to the wrong door, opens it and finds it
          empty. She giggles and moves to the next one.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          That smoke fucked me _up._ up.
          Brigitte finds Ginger with her shirt and all, the bandages
          peeled off. she is dabbing at herself with wads of toilet
          paper.
          The scratches and bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo,
          under which a fine film of dark hairs have sprouted.
          Brigitte steps into the stall agape. The door hits her on the
          way in.

<b>          INT. BATHROOM STALL - DAY

          Ginger and Brigitte stand nose to nose in the stall. Brigitte
          has not fully closed the door. Ginger is just as stoned as
          Brigitte.

          The Trinas prance in to powder their noses. The Trina grabs
          the first stall door -- Brigitte and Ginger's.
          Brigitte and Ginger stand frozen like the proverbial deer in
          headlights. Trina does not see Ginger's transformation. But
          Ginger Is just doing her top up.

          Trina backs away, her hands to her mouth.

          Trina, licking her lips in a grotesque mock-lust. The Trinas
          shrink back against the farthest wall.

</b>          Yeah, who's next? I'm still

          Brigitte's jaw drops. Ginger turns to leave and the Trinas,
          start to relax. Ginger whips around again:

          time.
          Trina stares Brigitte down as she folds up a note and passes
          it to a classmate. It is read and passed on by every kid in
          the room during this scene.
          Brigitte holds her scalpel over the over their piggy -
          hesitating. Ginger's attention is riveted on the little
          carcass.

</b>          They're all looking at us.

          Ginger looks up at Jason, who is reading the note. Jason
          smiles at Ginger and destroys the note. Trina seethes.
          Ginger grabs the knife from Brigitte. she makes a deep
          incision in the pig's belly.

</b>          So! You're growing fur an,

          Ginger spies two girls giggling at her. Using both hands
          Ginger cracks the carcass. wide open like a clam. Ginger digs
          in, gouging out the pig's parts with her bare hands. Ginger
          breaks into a sweat, her breathing gets heavy.
          Brigitte cautiously looks around at their classmates. she
          moves to shield Ginger from prying eyes.

</b>          hold on, I'm goi.n' for the

          Ginger has begun scraping away at the pig's cranium with her
          finger nails. A sickening creak, snap, and the brain is
          exposed. Ginger - unconsciously - licks her fingers as she
          admires its frontal lobe.

          Before Brigitte can answer, Ginger lifts the brain out on her
          finger tips, gently pushes Brigitte out of her way and...
          Whap! The brain lands squarely on Trina's head. Trina

          Brigitte is dying a thousand deaths on the examining table
          with her feet in stirrups. The GYNECOLOGIST is examining
          her.
          A NURSE stands next to him, smiling benignly as she passes
          him the contraption used to take a pap smear. Brigitte is
          almost in tears.

          in their seats.
          The doctor is gulping cups of water from the water cooler,
          his hand shaking. He talks to Pamela like the girls aren't
          even there.

          Its persistence is making her mental.

          the euphoric high of his
          murders."
          Ginger shaves the delicate area around her ankles. She cuts
          herself and freaks. Ginger snaps the Lady Bic in half and
          throws the pieces hard against the shower wall.

</b>          Fuck fuck fuck FUCK
          There are two other broken razors in the stall, stuffed with
          hairs. Blood mixes with the water and swirls around her
          toes.

          The doq is still barkin .outside. Brigitte closes her book.

          beat.

          Ginger is over the fence with ease. Norman barks more,
          harder.

<b>          EXT. FITZGERALD YARD - MEANWHILE/NIGHT
</b>
          Brigitte can't vault the fence. She clambers up a shared tree
          at the fence line to see.
          Ginger tries to grab the dog but he dances around her,
          barking like crazy. She grabs his snout with her bare hands
          and he bites her hard.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Sonnovabitch!
          Now livid, Ginger takes up a dead tree branch.
          Up in the tree, Brigitte hides her face in her hands.
          Ginger (:racks the stick over the dog's head. The yelping
          stops but Ginger keeps hitting. Blood splatters over her
          face. And Ginger tastes it.
          Ginger drops her stick. She drags the body into the hedge
          next to the fence.
          Brigitte lowers her hands from her eyes. Ginger is directly
          below her, concealed from the house by the shrubs.
          Ginger falls to her knees before the corpse. She lifts a
          rattling hand to touch him. She lowers her face to the bloody
          mess. She's sweating, vibrating, physically resisting an
          irresistible drive. Ginger's tongue slips between her lips.
          And Ginger licks Morely's body.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Oh. No. G-ginger -!
          Ginger begins to eat the dead dog. The feed. quickly becomes
          a ravenous frenzy.
          Above her, Brigitte leans over the branch she's barely
          balancing on, hyperventilating.
          Vomit sails down from Brigitte's perch.

          Brigitte scrambles down the tree and yanks Ginger off the
          dog. Ginger's face is smeared in blood. Ginger's stunned, and
          reels dizzily. They crouch, waiting.
          Their NEIGHBOR opens the screen door, shaking a box of dog
          biscuits.

          The neighbor steps into the yard. Approaches the hedge.

          twitching in the grass. Then they disappear, the porch light

          Bailey Downs sleeps soundly as the hunt begins. The moon is a
          sliver of its former self.
          Ginger cocks her head at the sound of a dog barking. She
          lifts her nose into the wind and sniffs. Ginger is prowls
          like a wild cat through yards and service lanes, as
          A study in much less stealth, Brigitte stumbles, trips and
          slips after Ginger. Splits her sweats climbing fences. Loses
          a shoe over garage roofs, gets caught in automated lawn
          sprinklers, falls into hidden cellar window troughs, as
          A series of dogs perk their ears and snarl from their dog
          houses, chains, and porch perches...
          Low whistles and smoochy sounds lure the dogs into bushes,
          behind cars, around fences. Strings of dogs' chains strain
          tight, then slacken...
          Ginger - wild-eyed, bloody-mouthed, and euphoric - tosses
          collars at Brigitte. Brigitte misses most of the tosses. She
          picks up the collars and fingers these souvenirs with

          The grossly over-weight guidance councilor, MR. WAYNE, is
          perched on the edge of his fake wood desk, holding their
          death slides (from the credit sequence) up to the fluorescent
          light. His arm pits are stained with sweat.
          Ginger slumps in a chair before him. There is a fish bowl
          full of condoms on his desk. Ginger picks one out, unwrapping
          it, examining it as he talks.

          Brigitte turns the music off and creeps up to Trina. Blood
          trickles out of Trina's ear and swirls into the milky glass
          mess at her mouth. Her open eyes stare at nothing. She's
          dead.

          Trina for a pulse. Brigitte snaps her hand back as though it
          were burned. A tremor wracks Brigitte's body and she
          convulses. Brigitte runs to the bathroom. OFF SCREEN,
          Brigitte throws up.
          Meanwhile Ginger raises her afflicted hand. The hand is
          nowsomething clearly on the way to being a wolfen paw. The
          nails are black, curling claws.
          Oblivious, Brigitte climbs back into bed and covers her face
          with a pillow.

          sickened.
          Grass and dirt spray out of the playhouse. Ginger is digging
          up the ground inside doggie style. She emerges, shaking the

          Something starts to crack.
          With ferocious effort, Ginger contorts herself through two
          inches of space. The cracking is coming from Ginger as she
          squeezes her body bizarre-ly out of joint, as a contortionist
          might.
          Once through, she snaps and clicks her distended bones back

          Brigitte wheels a large cloth cart full of basket balls
          around a corner.
          The janitor crawls toward her, his hands lifted to her for
          help, blood spurting from his slashed throat. He tries to
          cry out, but only makes a gurgling whistle, the air in his
          Qi s passing through blood.
          Ginger walks behind him as he crawls. Ginger applies her boot
          to his ass and makes him slip face first in his own gore.
          Ginger giggles.
          Ginger looks up and sees Brigitte gaping in utter revulsion
          at her. For a split second, Ginger stops cold. Ginger seems
          to falter before her sister's horror.
          Then, without breaking their locked gaze, without even
          seeming conscious she's doing it - Ginger steps on the man's
          fingers and breaks them with a series of snaps.
          Brigitte tries to pry her eyes away, but can't.
          Still staring at Brigitte, Ginger extends her claws. Ginger
          shakes her head, as if to say I can't help it.. .Ginger
          pounces on the man. Brigitte turns her face to the wall.
          The lanitor makes a final horrible noise. The halls fall
          silent.

          as Brigitte stuffs Mr. Wayne into the gym basket and covers
          him with balls,
          Ginger runs madly up and down the halls screeching and
          whooping, slamming her monster arm into the lockers bashing
          them in.
          as Brigitte pushes the janitor's body into a ground level air

          unleashes foam into the halls.

          Brigitte mops up the janitor's blood with his own cart stuff.
          The Guidance office is already clean.
          Ginger lifts the fire extinguisher over her head. She starts
          running with it toward through the frosted glass window of
          the main office with a triumphant war whoop.
          Brigitte steps between Ginger and her target.

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Move!

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          STOP IT! Just stop. Enough,
          Ginger. Please. Please.
          Ginger throws the canister any way, forcing Brigitte to dive
          out of the way. SMASH! Glass rains down over. Brigitte.
          Brigitte lifts her head in time to see Ginger burn down the
          hall looking for more mischief.
          Brigitte curls into a fetal position, burying her face in her
          lap and rocks herself. Brigitte sobs.
          OFF-SCREEN we hear Ginger cont.inuing her ram a e else where
          in the school. Brigitte wanders up to the janitor's cart,
          looking like a plane crash survivor - dazed and wretched.
          Brigitte picks up a bottle of cleaning fluid. She sniffs it.
          She closes her eyes and tips it back. She washes it around in
          her mouth and lifts her chin to swallow. She spews it into
          the air, the taste making her heave instinctively. she dry
          heaves a couple of times. She throws the bottle at the wall.

          Exhausted, Brigitte trails Ginger who is tired too, and
          heading for the exit. They stop dead at the doors.

<b>          EXT. SCHOOL STEPS - NIGHT
</b>
          A truck's headlights pin them in full view. Ginger rolls her
          sleeve down over her paw. Brigitte swoons as if she might
          black out on the spot.
          The truck's engine cuts and the doors slowly open.

          Ginger prods a claw into Brigitte's chest, pinning her in

          Ginger's claw pricks Brigitte's skin. Brigitte cringes.

</b>          What.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          I'm sorry, but...!
          Brigitte writhes in pain as Ginger's claw slices in deeper.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Ginger?! This is me.
          Ginger retracts the claw, and Brigitte grabs the wound.

</b>          Ginger hurls Brigitte against the wall. Ginger throws herself
          on top of Brigitte. Ginger raises her killing claw to

<b>          GINGER
</b>          Who needs you?
          Brigitte is helpless and looks terrified. Ginger's face is
          contorted with intensity, with madness. Ginger's drooling. A
          drip of gob drops onto Brigitte's face.

          Brigitte backs out of Ginger's way.
          Ginger steps up i.o the window and climbs through.
          Brigitte rubs her throat, trying hard to keep breathing.
          Brigitte dashes to her own bed and drags an Adidas gym bag
          from under it. Brigitte starts grabbing clothes off the
          floor and jamming them into the bag.

          Light streams from inside the yard, multi-coloured, strobing.
          It looks like a UFO has landed on the other side of the
          fence.
          She peers through the slats. She sees the playhouse, lit up
          like a Christmas tree. She sees gloved hands and police
          uniforms. Then sliding past, the long - almost endless -
          shape on a stretcher being drawn out of the playhouse:
          they've found Trina's body.

          hard.

          Brigitte opens her eyes. The bus is almost here. Brigitte
          grips her Adidas bag.

          fills frame. when its tail lights pass, Brigitte is far down
          the street, running like a champion in the direction she came
          from.

          Brigitte carefully unlocks the bedroom door and slowly opens
          it. The room is dark and just as she left it. Ginger's hed
          has not been slept in, and she is no where to be seen.

          and pushes a bureau of drawers in front of it.

          Brigitte climbs into bed, snuggling the bat in with her. She
          lights a smoke. She finds the feminine hygiene calendar on
          the bedside table next to the photo of the girls as kids at
          Halloween, taken many years before.
          The calendar tells us it is about to be Friday. Friday is the

          Brigitte snaps to, gripping the bat. Ginger snorts, and
          climbs into her own bed.
          Brigitte swings her gaze to the window. It is still shut and
          locked. The bureau is still in front of the door. Brigitte
          holds her hat tightly and watches her sister's back in the

          them on the grass. Brigitte plows through.
          Ginger rides past, piggy-backed by Jason. Ginger completely
          ignores Brigitte. Brigitte looks very worried.

          Their eyes meet, their faces are inches apart. Brigitte

          runs a few steps toward Sam. Brigitte looks back at Ginger,
          who drills her with an evil warning glare.
          The cops shove Sam into the back of a cruiser. They roar

          her shirt and has a good scratch where it was itching her.
          OFF-SCREEN are the sounds of slurp kisses and Jason's moans.

          the SNAP-WHAP of one being fitted on pretty roughly.

          Brigitte - now in ZOMBIE-face - rubs the monkshood between
          her fingers, crumbling it into a neat pile on the counter.
          OFF-SCREEN from the bedroom, the sounds of Ginger having
          rough sex continue.
          Brigitte peels a centimeter of paper off the end of an unlit
          smoke and wiggles the cigarette, creating a second pile of
          tobacco. She reaches into the radiator vent and withdraws a
          package of rolling papers.

          One BOY in a skeleton costume creeps along the shrubs toward
          the Fitzgerald sisters' bedroom window. He stumbles over a
          demon, a Frankenstein and a mummy. They curse one another.

          OFF-SCREEN, from the rec room part noise grows as things get
          under way outside.
          Ginger waves good-bye to Jason as she undoes Frank's shirt
          buttons. The bathroom door is now inching open a crack.

          On the counter at the sink, all evidence of Brigitte's
          project with the monkshood are gone.
          Brigitte peers out the cracked door and then looks away,
          fighting an urge to watch in spite of being grossed out. The
          sounds of sex drift in from the bedroom.
          She catches sight of herself in the mirror. As a ZOMBIE. She
          tugs her shirt tight over her breasts. Nothing to see.
          She smoothes her shirt with her hands, then moves her palms
          down over her waist, her hips. Over her crotch. Brigitte's
          fingers skip under her skirt.
          Brigitte's face tells us she's searching for something under
          there. She's trying this out. But nothing's happening.
          She frowns. She draws her hands out of her skirt and quickly
          washes her hands in the sink. She checks her watch and sighs.

          Brigitte creeps out of the bathroom on all fours. Above her,
          Ginger's feet and some guy's writhe on the bed.
          Brigitte reaches up to the bedroom door knob. She opens it
          and crawls out.

          Ginger glances at Brigitte, who tries to pretend she's not

<b>          EXT. STREETS/TRAVELING - NIGHT
</b>
          The truck speeds down the street a tad erratical ly. Sirens
          rise around it.

<b>          INT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT
</b>
          Brigitte slows, looking left, right and in the side mirrors
          trying to see where the sirens are coming from.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Fuck, fuck fuck, FUCK.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>           105
</b>          Then suddenly, four cop cars blast past them in the opposite
          direction. Heading back to the Fitzgerald house.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Ha! All rightie then.
          Brigitte drives on.
          What she cannot see behind her in the grate are the glimpses
          of Ginger in the flickering lights of the passing street
          lamps. Her final spurt of transformation is taking place:
          FLASH! Her face is filling in with fur.
          FLASH! Her eyes glow golden, yellow, wolfen.
          FLASH! Her face pulls into a wet snout.
          FLASH! A long pink tongue lolls out between glistening white
          fangs.

<b>          EXT. THE HILLCREST - NIGHT
</b>
          The truck rolls to the crest of the hill over Bailey Downs -
          the sight of the bush party. The moon is immense up here.
          You could almost touch it.

<b>          INT. THE TRUCK - NIGHT
</b>
          Brigitte eases the truck to the edge of the hill. The lights
          of the homes below them creep into view.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          okay, Ginger? They'll think that
          Sam took us from our room,
          right? 'Cause of his record an,
          the arrest, right? We're gonna
          make this look like he did, any
          ways. He got us, maybe killed
          us, took our bodies to do some
          unspeakable thingy. But then?
          Sam killed himself. You follow?
          Ginger doesn't answer.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          So boom, diversion. Meanwhile
          you an, me hit the highway. we
          can hitch, get you cleaned up.
          By the time the find out we
          weren't in Sam's clutches at
          all, we could be any wheres.
          Yeah? Whatcha think?
          Ginger doesn't answer.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          It'll work. (I hope.)
          Brigitte puts the brake on but does not cut the engine.

<b>          EXT. THE TRUCK/HILLCREST - NIGHT
</b>
          Brigitte climbs out of the cab. She moves to the back doors
          of the truck, and opens them. In the inky darkness inside,
          she hears heavy panting.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Ginger? C'mon, we got move.
          Shove Sam down here.
          Brigitte climbs up into the truck, reaching for something on
          its floor. Brigitte f itids Sam's prone feet.
          An animal/Ginger launches out at her, knocking her back, out,
          clear of the truck. Ginger isn't Ginger any more - what we
          can glimpse in the darkness is an attack by a creature much
          like the one that bit Ginger. And it's attacking Brigitte.
          Brigitte flails, kicks and punches at it. She breaks free
          and clambers at the tool rack on the inside panel of the
          truck. She grabs a shovel as the creature comes snarling up
          at her.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Stop. I mean it.
          It lunges at her again and Brigitte clocks it. It slides,
          dazed, off the back of the truck to the ground.

<b>          JUMP TO:
</b>          Brigitte drags Sam's body into the front seat. She sets her
          Adidas bag on the gas pedal. She releases the brake.
          The truck rolls forward. off the top of the hill. Brigitte
          watches as it crashes down, down, rolling and twisting into
          the suburb below. It lands in a heap and bursts into flames.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Nice one.
          Brigitte returns to where It/Ginger was last seen on the
          ground. The shovel and blanket are there. A bloody pool
          trails off into the woods. Brigitte hefts the shovel warily,
          shoulders the blanket, and follows the wetness shining in the
          moonlight.

<b>          INT. TREES/HILLCREST - NIGHT
</b>

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Fuck Ginger. Leave a fuckin'
          trail much? Could leave
          everybody a fuckin' map...
          Tense seconds pass as she searches through the scrub and
          trees, shovel ready. we can hear panting and growling.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          I won't hurt you if you don't
          hurt me. 'Kay? Ginge'? 'Kay?
          Brigitte spots something ahead and lowers the shovel as she
          approaches it.
          It/Ginger cowers in the brush, collapsed. Her head and tail
          are bleeding. Brigitte drops to her knees nest to her
          sister, frantic with grief.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          Oh no. Ginger. I didn't mean

<b>          TO
</b>          It/Ginger is gasping, fading. Her eyes start rolling back in
          her head. Brigitte's hand is shaking as it reaches out but
          can't touch her. Ginger licks Brigitte's fingers, slowly.
          Brigitte buries her face in Ginger's ruff, moaning.

<b>          BRIGITTE
</b>          You can't, you can't, we're out.
          You can't, don't don't do this
          to me. Not now. Look, look it's
          all taken care of. we're
          Unsolved Mysteries!

          The sunrise has the sky this bloody red.

</b>          Brigitte drags Ginger a few feet past a sign next to the
          road: THANK YOU FOR VISITING BAILEY DOWNS!

<b>          BRIGITTE (V/O)
</b>          We made it out. There was this
          road? An' the space between
          here and where ever. I did it.
          Brigitte opens the blanket. Ginger has returned to human
          form. Because Ginger is dead.

<b>          EXT. A HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING
</b>
          In a small grove of trees, Brigitte pushes the last pile of
          dirt over Ginger's shallow grave.
          Brigitte wipes her caked hands off in the dewy grass. Beneath
          the dirt and dried blood, she finds puncture wounds. BITES.
          Brigitte looks TO CAMERA. She rolls her eyes wearily.
          Brigitte stands and heads to the side of the road. A semi
          appears on the horizon, coming her way. Brigitte lifts her
          thumb.
          The semi's turn indicator comes on as it slows and veers to
          arrive before her.
          ROLL TAIL CREDITS as:
          Excerpts from an episode of the television program UNSOLVED
          MYSTERIES roll. It tells the story of the mysterious
          disappearance of two teenage girls - sisters - who
          disappeared under strange circumstances in the normally quiet
          suburb of Bailey Downs.
          Brigitte and Ginger LOOK-A-LIKES re-enact the summarized
          events of their flight from justice. The cops figured out
          their faked deaths, of course.. Henry and Pamela have
          reportedly denied comment. It is seen from the community's
          perspective as two delusional young women gone totally wrong,
          a grotesque tragedy of youth wasted by mental illness. No one
          can explain though the non-human blood trails leaving the
          scene of their last crime...
          At the segment's close and the credits roll. out, we see the
          traditional high school photos of Brigitte and Ginger.
