<b>          EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY
</b>
          An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in
          front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with
          flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We
          see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a
          company of about 50 - 75 employees.

<b>          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY
</b>
          We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line
          production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge
          vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring
          products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a
          high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big
          windows overlooking this manufacturing area.
          We PAN up to the main office.

<b>          INSIDE THE OFFICE
</b>          JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the
          phone with his friend DEAN.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          You should come by tonight. Half
          price well drinks while the game's
          going.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          You always give me free drinks
          though.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Oh yeah. Well come by anyway.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah?... Might as well. No action
          going on at my house, that's for
          sure.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Really? The wife out of town?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          No... I just haven't been laid in
          a month.

          You guys having problems or
          something?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          No. This is pretty much normal
          these days...
          As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the
          manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down
          through various stages of assembly line production, then
          follows several bottles of orange extract moving past
          HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The
          camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,
          beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and
          mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he
          says sound as macho and important as possible.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          You get this job through Manpower?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          I started here with Manpower too.
          Started out on the line just like
          you.

<b>                         (DEAD-SERIOUS)
</b>           Only I did better... 40 crates a
          day. 
          Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.
          STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only
          polite reaction would be one of total amazement.

<b>                         STEP (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm the best sorter in here.
          That's why they made me full time
          with benefits. I'll probably be
          floor manager this year.
          A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with
          too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail,
          lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of
          pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought
          to be out of style by now.

<b>          3.
</b>          Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He
          flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
          application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping
          each box when he's done, generally making the activity look
          like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step
          and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets.

<b>                         RORY
</b>          (hands them each a flier)
          My band's playing this Friday, come
          check us out.
          Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties
          clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, "God's
          Cock". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much
          English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the
          flier.
          AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,
          sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-
          wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,
          and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-
          shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always
          shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a
          clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her
          head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her
          forties.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          You see that... That new guy.
          He's holding us up. It's not my
          job to tell them to hold the line
          either.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          And then Joel's gonna come yell at
          us, cuz he's not doing his job.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          (folds her arms, fed up)
          I'm just gonna sit here.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          You're not gonna shut it off?

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I'm not gonna hold the line. If
          they're not gonna do their job, why
          should I do mine.
          Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause
          the conveyor belt.

<b>          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Joel is still on the phone with Dean.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          If I don't get home before about
          8:00, she puts on the sweatpants
          and once the sweatpants are on,
          it's over -- I get nothing.
          (notices something down

<b>                         BELOW)
</b>          Shit. I'm gonna have to call you
          back.
          Joel hangs up and runs downstairs.

<b>          ON THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR:
</b>          Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line.
          Step sees this, runs to shut off the line, yelling at Mary.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          What are you doing?!

<b>                         MARY
</b>          What are YOU doing?!
          (pointing at Hector)
          What is he doing?
          A YELLING/BICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory
          and Gabriella. Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt.

<b>                         JOEL (CONT'D)
</b>          All right. Now, what's the
          problem?
          They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING.

<b>                         JOEL (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay! Okay, everyone settle down.
          Now Mary. Hector here is new okay?
          It's gonna take him a couple of
          days, maybe his English isn't so
          good. You gotta be patient.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          That's what I was tryin' to say.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          And Step, if you wanna be Floor
          Manager, this is the kind of thing
          you're going to have to deal with.

<b>

</b>          Exactly.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's
          get this cleaned up, and get
          rolling again. We can't afford to
          fall behind today.
          Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts
          right back up with Gabriella.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          You see that? We always get the
          blame.

<b>          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER
</b>
          Joel sits in his swivel chair, looking down at the production
          floor, shaking his head. BRIAN, Joel's second in command,
          walks in. He's a little older than Joel, neatly trimmed
          beard, aviator glasses, and a bit of a gut. He wears a
          Reynold's Extract golf shirt and Khaki pants. He walks over
          to the window, joins Joel, looking down at the employees.

<b>                         JOEL 
</b>          Jesus... They're like a bunch of 
          goddamned children. 

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          Tell me about it. Sorry I missed
          the drama; I was showing boy-genius
          down there how to back up a
          forklift.
          ANGLE ON Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as 
          he passes someone. 

<b>                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
</b>          That's his whole career, driving
          that damn forklift. You'd think
          he'd wanna learn how.

<b>                         JOEL 
</b>          Well, I guess he's got that band 
          he's in too... 

<b>                         BRIAN

          name but can't)
          Dinkus down there...

<b>                          JOEL 
</b>          Who, Mary? 

<b>                          BRIAN
</b>          No, the other one -- what's-her-
          face -- she asked me -- or rather
          "axed" me -- for more personal
          days. Just like that. I told her
          maybe if she figures out how to
          fill out the time sheets correctly
          I'll give her more personal days...
          (Off Joel's look)
          Don't worry, she will never fill
          out her time sheets correctly.
          Joel looks down at the production floor. Joel's POV: 
           ANGLE ON: Mary and Step bickering. Step walks off. Mary and 
           Gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of 
          old hens. 

<b>          JOEL (O.S.)
</b>          Look at 'em... I am so sick of baby
          sitting these assholes.
          (looks at his watch)
          I better get going...
          Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about 
          "sweatpants." 

<b>          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
          Joel drives home, in a hurry, checking his dashboard clock.
          It's an upscale neighborhood of McMansions in a town like
          Lincoln Nebraska. He turns a corner, slows down suddenly
          when he sees something.

<b>                         JOEL'S POV:
</b>          NATHAN, a middle-aged, overweight, annoying guy is going out
          to the street to get his mail.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          (to himself, praying)
          Please go back inside... Please

<b>          7.
</b>          It's too late. Nathan turns, sees Joel's car and waves, then
          crosses the street to Joel's driveway and waits to talk to
          him.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>
<b>                         (TO HIMSELF)
</b>          Shit!
          Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down. Joel
          begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan
          can talk to him.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya...
          Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while,
          leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car,
          trapping Joel.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          How've ya been? I left you a
          message last week. I don't know if

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of
          in a hurry here.

</b>          Yeah, in fact...
          (checks his watch)
          I should go right now actually. I
          gotta call the office before they
          leave.

<b>                         NATHAN

          uncomfortable.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Oh no -- It's not like that. She
          won't be uncomfortable. I
          guarantee it. No, it's not like
          that at all. It's not formal or

          tickets, since they're gonna sell
          out fast. You talk to Suzie. See

          right there in his garage.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Sorry, I almost forgot -- the

          I know that's a little steep, but
          the food is fantastic and it's for
          a good cause. So that'd be eighty
          dollars total. There's no tax or

          talk about this another time.
          Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door,
          waiting for Nathan to get out. Nathan stops, just inside.

          Nathan finally steps out of the garage. Joel breaths a huge

<b>          ANGLE ON THE GARAGE DOOR:

          goes down.

</b>          Oh, Joel one more thing--
          Joel lets the door shut on him, and bolts into the house.

          Joel walks into the living room just as his wife, SUZIE,
          enters from the bedroom pulling on her SWEATPANTS. A look of
          disappointment on Joel's face. Suzie is a decent looking
          woman, about Joel's age.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Man, that Nathan won't shut up.

          Joel puts his arm around her, caresses her shoulder. She
          doesn't seem to notice as he starts getting fresh.

           Delayed reaction -- she notices Joel is getting frisky. He 
          gets closer, starts kissing her neck.

          Suzie jumps up with newfound energy, runs for the remote and
          turns on the TV. Joel just sits there.

<b>          INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY
</b>
          CINDY, a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter
          looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of
          the really nice ones. The price tag says $3,950. She's
          beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something
          vulnerable and sweet about her as well.
          Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired,
          goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much
          attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women
          this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each
          other trying to help her.

<b>                         SALESMAN #1
</b>          Yeah, it's expensive but it's
          sweet... Are you familiar with the
          Gibson humbucking pickups?

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          No, sorry. I don't play. It's for
          my Dad actually -- for his
          fiftieth birthday. My sisters and
          I are all pitching in.

          love these humbuckings. They
          really kick ass.
          An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy,
          trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible.
          He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side.

          room.

<b>                         CINDY

<b>                         SALESMAN #2
</b>          Well this is an excellent jazz
          guitar. It's what Pat Metheny
          plays.

<b>                         SALESMAN #1
</b>          Is your Dad into Metheny at all?

<b>                         CINDY

<b>                         CINDY

<b>                         CINDY

          colors?

<b>                         SALESMAN #1

          The salesmen practically trip over each other, going into the
          back to find the other guitar.
          Cindy stands there alone for a beat. She looks around. Then
          casually picks up the four-thousand dollar guitar and walks
          out the front door with it.

          The two Salesmen return -- one carrying the sunburst-finish
          guitar and the other with the hard-shell case. They look
          around, notice she's gone. They stand there for a beat,
          disappointed, before they realize what just happened.

</b>          Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Yeah it is, but I find it's good
          for just about any phsychological
          problem. I mean, basically it just
          makes you feel good, so it sort of
          works for anything. I even take it
          when I have a cold. It's probably

          licenses. On one, her name says MISTY PATTERSON. It's a

          with the name CINDY METZLER on it and puts that in front,

          "several million dollars" then back to "no testicles" then
          quickly back and forth several times -- "million dollars" "no
          testicles" "million dollars" "no testicles"
          ON CINDY'S FACE - A look of determination. She looks one
          more time at the name under the picture -- Don "Step"

          in a couple of days. Speaking of
          which, the guys at General Mills
          heard about this whole Step thing.
          They're worried. If Step decides
          to sue us -- beyond the insurance
          settlement -- it could be a serious
          liability. They don't want to make
          an offer until this thing has
          settled.

<b>                         JOEL 
</b>          Really? They think it's that big 
          of a liability? 

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          Well yeah. Don't you? I mean,
          think about it. Imagine if you
          asked a bunch of jurors how much
          you'd have to pay 'em to cut their
          balls off? I mean, I wouldn't let
          someone cut my balls off for a
          billion dollars. Seriously --
          unless there were some kind of
          really expensive operation that
          could give you artificial balls or
          something. Would you?

<b>                         JOEL 
</b>          No, I guess not. 

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          Anyway, I wouldn't worry. He says
          he's not going to sue us. Says he

<b>                         (CRUDE IMITATION)
</b>          "don't want somethin' fer nothin "'
          and "What's right is right." If we
          can just get him to sign something
          to that effect we should be fine.

<b>                         JOEL 
</b>          Boy, Step sure is being mellow 
          about all this. 

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          Yeah, well I think when you lose
          your balls it mellows you out. You
          don't get as pissed off and

</b>          Yes Step... That's why I called a
          lawyer for you -- that guy on all
          the bus stop benches.

<b>                         STEP

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          I'm sorry Step, your doctor said
          you shouldn't get aroused.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          No he didn't.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          Maybe it was your lawyer, but he
          talked to your doctor. And your
          doctor said it's very important not
          to get aroused until after the
          trial... I'm sorry.

<b>                         STEP

</b>          Look Step, you're getting me turned
          on, I'm getting you turned on... I
          better just go.

           blonde, super good-looking, but clearly a complete airhead.
          Joel looks really messed up now.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          So it's two-hundred dollars then?

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Yeah, two-hundred.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Well yeah, but don't forget, I'm
          getting ten percent.

<b>                         JOEL

</b>          I don't think they're called

          prostitutes, okay. There's some
          other word for it -- it's not a
          "john," but it's something like
          that. Besides, I'm the one who
          hooked all this up. And don't worry

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          No no no. God no! It's not like

          be at work. Remember? We already
          talked about this.
          Brad looks blank, like he's not getting it.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          What you'll do, is come to my house
          pretending to be the new pool
          cleaner. Then you simply try to
          seduce my wife. Okay? If she
          doesn't respond, you simply clean
          the pool and leave. That's all.
          It's that simple.
          Hold on Brad for a long beat.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          So, uh, you're not gonna touch my

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          NO! Try to pay attention okay? I
          will not be there. I will be at
          work. You come over to my house
          while I'm not there, posing as the
          new pool cleaner and then try to
          seduce her...

          you know -- what I do, like you
          know, lonely housewives and shit,
          maybe you could tell 'em about me,
          you know...
          Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad can't seem to stop
          talking.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Cuz like, I figure if I did a
          few jobs and I was, like, really
          good? Then maybe they'd tell their
          friends, you know, and they'd give
          me a... what do you call those
          things?

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Referrals.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Yeah yeah, those things. Then
          those women could tell more women
          and then it'd be like I was, like,
          uh... branching or..

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Networking.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Yeah, networking! Totally. Then
          if I got enough of 'em, maybe I
          could quit my landscaping job and
          do this full time. That would be
          awesome! Cause I hate landscaping.
          I like getting laid a lot better,
          and my boss is a total dick...

</b>          Hmm... it's something like,... I
          think it's a Mexican name.

</b>          Yeah, I thought it was weird too --
          a guy like that with a Mexican last
          name... It's like Lopez, or Sanchez
          or something.

           As Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's
           telling. It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax.
           We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag.

<b>           BRAD (V.0.)
</b>           .I don't know anything about pool
           cleaning, so I was just faking it.
           She was in her bathing suit...
          Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs.

<b>           BRAD (V.0.)
</b>          .So I struck up a conversation...

</b>          No. It's ours.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Wow, you look so young to be living

<b>          BRAD (V.0.)
</b>          I thought that was pretty smart
          of me -- to ask her to borrow
          sunscreen. See, 'cuz that way,
          once she gave me some, I could ask
          her if she wanted some too, and rub
          some on her back, instead of just
          coming out and asking her to rub
          some on her. Pretty smooth huh?...
          We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face-
          down on the chair.

<b>          BRAD (V.0.)
</b>          Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on
          her, the rest was easy...
          We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back.
          Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel
          interrupts, YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK.

</b>          NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye.
          Joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair, in a

           car in an attempt to hide, but Nathan notices him, waves and
           crosses the street. Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his
          driveway.

</b>          Yeah. Well I won't keep you. I
          just wanted to let you know, I got
          those tickets to that dinner we
          talked about on the 7th. I think I
          told you they were forty dollars a
          piece, but it turns out it's a tad
          more this year -- fifty-five -- so
          if I could go ahead and just get a
          check from you guys...

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          No, this is the 7th. You said
          you're going out of town on the
          17th.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah, but remember, I told you we
          didn't really want to go to this
          thing.
          Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about to snap.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          But I already bought the tickets.
          I know you said something about her

          might've talked to a lawyer.
          Joel goes to his desk, sits down.

          going to make their offer official
          until this settles.
          Joel considers this.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I think Step is just chest-beating.
          He does this all the time. He gets
          all wound up, talks big, then he
          always backs down. And that's with
          his balls.

<b>          INT. PAROLE OFFICE - AFTERNOON
</b>
          It's a bleak looking office with rows of cubicles. We PAN
          past several cubicles where hardass parole officers meet with
          their parolees -- various gang-bangers, drug dealers,
          junkies, a hideous transvestite prostitute, etc. As we pan,
          each officer is giving them nothing -- "this is your last
          chance," "You expect me to believe that?", etc. We continue
          past officers giving them nothing, giving them nothing,
          ending on a cubicle with Cindy, where a PAROLE OFFICER is
          giving Cindy everything -- almost apologetic.

<b>                         PAROLE OFFICER
</b>          I'm sorry to even bring this up,
          but you're not living with the drug
          dealer anymore are you?
          Cindy's parole officer is a sad schlub of a guy, about 50
          with bushy grey hair and a mustache, he has a badge and a gun
          on his belt.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          Nope. I'm staying at Extended Stay
          until I can find a place...
          She smiles, flirtatiously waves her key/card.

<b>                         CINDY (CONT'D)
</b>          See?

<b>                         (SINCERE)

</b>          It's okay. I'm just glad to see
          you're doing so well... Ah, one
          more thing I just need to ask you:
          We had a little incident up in
          Templeton a couple weeks back where
          someone stole an expensive guitar
          from a music store? Someone who
          fit your description. You know
          anything about that?

<b>                         CINDY

</b>          Look Cindy, you realize you can't
          screw up anymore right? I mean,
          even something minor, and you could
          go back to jail for a while this
          time. I'd hate to see that happen.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          Well yeah, but why would I steal a
          guitar? I've got no musical
          talent. I'm tone deaf.
          They both laugh.

<b>                         PAROLE OFFICER
</b>          Heh heh, So am I. I can't carry a
          tune to save my life.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          Really? Wow...
          Cindy acts fascinated by Parole Officer's lack of musical
          talent. He happily goes on about it, forgetting about the
          guitar...

<b>                         PAROLE OFFICER

          Joel blushes awkwardly, like a junior high school kid.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Um... Okay. Sure.

<b>          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING
</b>
          Joel pulls into the driveway and is STARTLED as he
          practically runs over Nathan, flagging him down.
          Joel MUTTERS obscenities as he reluctantly stops and rolls
          down the window.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Hi there. Almost missed ya.

<b>                         JOEL

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Hey, I noticed you guys got a new

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          No. It was today. The new guy.

<b>                         JOEL

          I came home for lunch. I was gone
          all day yesterday. Anyway, you
          think I could go ahead and get that
           check from ya? Like I say, it's 55
           dollars a plate, so that'd be 110
           total. There's no tax...
          Nathan leans up to scratch his back. Joel seizes the
           opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber.

<b>          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Joel is on his cell phone, yelling in hushed tones at Brad.
          He has the door shut so Suzie won't hear him.

<b>                         JOEL

<b>          BRAD (V.0.)
</b>          Look, don't worry about it bro'. I

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Won't charge me for...? You had
          sex with my wife again?!

<b>          BRAD (V.0.)
</b>          Well, I figured we already did it
          once, so what's the big deal? I

          sex with my wife for free! And I
          better not ever catch you anywhere
          near my house ever again!
          Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone,
          picks it back up and hits the "End" button.

<b>          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Suzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants. Joel walks
          through, mumbles something about going to a party.

<b>          INT. JOEL'S CAR -- NIGHT
</b>
          Joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on. He
          stays in the car, checking it out.
          Scanning Joel's POV, we see the band, Godscock, playing in
          the backyard, with Rory on bass. They are set up on the
          patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house. Most of the
          people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is on
          the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band. The band
          sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired. The
          lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but even
          more loud and overly dramatic. Rory acts all intense, in
          stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music.

          It's downright pathetic.
          There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head,
          playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes.
          Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling. He
          watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away.

          (like a doctor)
          You should try smoking a little

          Right on.
          Willie finally exhales. The exhale seems to go on way longer
          than humanly possible, endless amounts of pot-smoke billowing
          out (accomplished with special FX). He finally hands the
          bong and lighter to Joel.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Oh, I don't know... I'm kind of a
          light weight. I think that's too
          much for me--

          bong and lighter)
          Bullshit.

</b>          Come on Joel. Don't worry, this
          stuff isn't that strong.

          Joel looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong,
          partly out of being intimidated by Willie.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Ah, what the hell.
          Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same
          condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would.

<b>                         WILLIE
</b>          Okay, now this is a gravity bong.
          Have you ever used one before?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Umm, I think... no.

</b>          Okay, pay attention. Put your
          thumb right here on the carburetor.
          When I pull the plunger up and say,
          "let go" I want you to let go and
          inhale hard.
          Joel's POV: Looking down the barrel of the three-foot bong
          with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the bowl.

          Mostly out of fear, Joel exhales. Willie puts the bong up to
          Joel's face, lights it and starts lifting the plunger. Then
          pushes it down.

</b>          Huh?
          Joel's POV: looking from Dean to Willie. Willie sits there
          with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to Joel.

          Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to
          Joel's paranoia. He stares at Joel for a long beat. Then,
          in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face.

          Joel gets the phone number out of his pocket.

          Beat. Once again, Joel doesn't know whether to shit or wind
          his watch. Willie stares at him, then

          looks at it, starts to dial, then pauses, realizing
          something.
          Willie looks up at Joel, with slowly building rage, then
          hangs up the phone.

</b>          Oh... You're joking right? Trying
          to make me paranoid?
          Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up. He doesn't. He
          just continues glaring at Joel. We hear the FRONT DOOR
          UNLOCK. Everyone looks.
          CINDY enters.

</b>          Joel? What are you doing here...?
          Willie stands up and walks over to Joel's chair. Dean
          suddenly stands up.

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          Well, it looks like you guys got a

          Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts to
          leave, but Willie blocks him.

<b>                         WILLIE
</b>          Kinda slutty?
          Willie grabs Joel and throws him against the wall. Joel
          tries to make a break for the door, but Willie hauls off and
          punches him across the face. The ass-kicking begins as we

           from the ass-kicking. He looks awful.
           As he limps into the bedroom as quietly as possible, he trips
           on something, waking up Suzie. She turns on a light and sees
          Joel.

</b>          Yep. And if it's okay with you,
          I'd like to go ahead and fire
          Hector.

<b>                         JOEL

          Joel looks down at Cindy with growing suspicion.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          No. Don't fire him. Just trust me
          on this. Give him another week.
          If anything else is stolen, then
          you can fire him.

</b>          Joel, Dean is on line one for you.

          that I don't like to get involved
          in other people's personal shit,

<b>                         DEAN
</b>          I didn't even know Willie had a

          Willie looked pissed.

</b>          He did take a swing at me Dean.
          Several swings. In fact, he beat

          Joel hangs up and walks out of his office, past his

</b>
          Joel turns the corner to his house and does a double-take as
          he sees BRAD'S TRUCK going the opposite direction.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Shit!
          Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck
          down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They both get out
          of their vehicles. Joel is livid.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          What the hell were you doing on my

          Joel is stumped -- Brad actually has a point.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          What the hell is wrong with you

          Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          You wouldn't do that.

          driveway.

</b>          Hi.
          Joel walks over to the sliding glass door, looks outside at
          the pool. It's filthy.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          So how was that new pool cleaner?
           Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but
          she plays it cool.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Um... What do you mean?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          What do you think I mean?... Did
          he do a good job cleaning the pool?

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Ah... well--

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Did he get all the... leaves? It
          doesn't really look that clean. I
          mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say
          it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the
          guy even clean it at all? It sure
          doesn't look like it.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>
<b>                         (NERVOUS)
</b>          Well yeah, I guess he didn't do a
          very good job.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I think he did a horrible job. I
          don't think we should use him
          anymore.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Okay.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Okay.
          Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Are you all right, Joel? You want

           In a WIDE SHOT we see Joel's car is parked on the street. He

          Step and Joel enter. Step's 300 POUND HALF-BROTHER sits on a
          ratty couch watching TV, drinking a huge plastic bottle of
          Pepsi. He looks like he's been sitting there for years. The
          TV is deafeningly loud.

<b>                         STEP

</b>          No Brad, we can't. I'm sorry, but

          Besides, I think Joel's getting
          suspicious. And you gotta start

          This was all a big mistake. I'm
          sorry. I don't know what got into
          me, but we have to stop this. I
          want to make my marriage work
          again. I'm going to tell Joel
          about the whole thing and just hope
          he forgives me. And even if he
          doesn't, at least I won't be

          JOE ADLER, is holding court with the various lawyers and
          paralegals waiting for the meeting to start. As promised, he
          is awful. He looks like Henry Winkler with an extra Y
          chromosome and a lot of steroids. (Maybe cast Gene Simmons
          with his hair pulled back in a pony tail.)

<b>                         ADLER
</b>          .You see, if both his balls had
          been knocked clean off, he would be
          a good case, but not a great case:
          A man with no balls is no man at
          all. He's a freak. He's barely
          human. He's gross. And a jury will
          never feel like they can walk in
          the shoes of a ball-less, neutered,
          he/she freak. But Step. He's
          still got one ball - barely. He's
          still a man. A man who's very
          manhood has been jeopardized, but
          still a man. And that manhood,
          that very sense of what you are as
          a human being is hanging by a
          thread. Jesus, you can't get more
          dramatic than that. That brave
          ball, hanging on for dear life,
          hanging on for justice, is going to
          be the hero of this trial. I'm
          tellin' ya this Step guy is the
          fuckin' Holy Grail, the Powerball
          Jackpot. And you all laughed at me
          when I bought those bus bench ads.

</b>          That's why what we should do is, is
          we should all go on strike --
          demand stock in the company before
          it sells. If General Mills knew
          we were on strike, they wouldn't
          buy this place until the strike was
          over. That way they'd have to give

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah?... What?
          But they are ill-prepared. No one knows who should talk
          first. It's incredibly awkward. They all look at each other
          and mutter things like, "go ahead" "you first". Finally...

          Joel's in no mood for this. He goes off on them.

          Joel storms out, leaving the employees standing there.
          A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed to do the
          talking, who said they would say what, who backed down first,
          etc. "I was gonna say something but you interrupted," "You
          didn't say anything when he was leaving, so I thought you
          were quitting. I would've stood up to him."
          As the argument dies down, one by one they all go back to
          their posts, muttering.

</b>          I hired him to have an affair with

</b>          Yeah, didn't work out.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Boy, you just can't get good help,
          eh?

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          So, did you get a chance to write
          that check?

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't
          going to that dinner okay?
          Nathan acts deeply disappointed.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Well gee, I wish you would've told
          me that before I went and bought
          the tickets.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Joel never agreed to this Nathan,
          and neither did I.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Well, it sure sounded like you guys
          were going. Leslie was gonna talk
          to you about it, but you didn't
          return our calls. I mean, I
          already bought these tickets.
          They're nonrefundable. I really
          wish you guys had been a little
          more clear with me...
          It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes
          all her pent-up aggression on Nathan.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Okay, let me be really clear with
          you then. When we say "I don't
          think so," or even "I'm not sure,"
          that means "no." Why can't you
          understand that?

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>          Well, I just--

<b>                         
</b>

<b>          91.
</b>
<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Shut up! In fact, let me be even
          more clear with you. We don't like
          you! Is that clear enough? You're
          dull, you never shut up, you never
          listen, and we don't want anything
          to do with you ever again!
          Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts to
          shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too good
          to stop.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Is that clear enough for you
          Nathan?! Is that...?
          Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure.

</b>
<b>                         (WORRIED)

          Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses.
          Suzie SCREAMS.

          something on the other side of the lot that gets his

          From JOEL'S POV, we see Cindy pull up and get out of her car.
          Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up
          the stairs. Joel gets out and watches her from a distance.
          He sees her go into a room and shut the door.
          He stares up at the door for a beat. Then, with a look of
          determination, Joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her
          door.

          Joel enters, stands in the living room. Cindy heads in to
          the kitchen.

<b>          CINDY (O.S.)
</b>          Do you want something to drink? I
          think all I have is Diet Coke.
          Joel notices MARY'S PURSE lying on the coffee table. He
          stares at it.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          No thanks.
          Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke.

          Joel remains standing, looking at the purse.

</b>           Cindy acts like he's being silly. There's nothing about her
          demeanor that would make anybody think she's lying.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          No. It probably just looks like
          it. There's a lot of those.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I've never seen another one. You
          probably have Sylvia's wallet in
          here somewhere too, don't you? And
          everything else that's been stolen
          from my employees.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          Joel, are you okay?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          No, I'm not. That's Mary's purse
          Goddammit! Okay? Everyone blamed

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Hector! Hard working guy, never
          did anything wrong. And what are
          you doing with Step? You're trying
          to screw him out of his settlement
          money aren't you?

<b>                         CINDY

</b>          Yes you do! You're the only reason
          he's suing us aren't you? You know
          how much work it took for me to
          build up that company? You just
          don't care about anybody do you?
          What are you, some kind of
          sociopath?
          Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her.

          Cindy turns away from him, looking down at the floor.

          Cindy, still looking away, doesn't answer.

<b>                         JOEL (CONT'D)
</b>          You can't answer can you? Because
          if you said one true thing, you'd
          have to tell the truth about
          something else and then it would
          all unravel wouldn't it? Then
          you'd have to admit that you stole
          this purse and God knows what else.
          Beat. Cindy still looking away, down at the floor. We see
          her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice.

          Joel picks up the purse.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          And I'm taking this purse with me.
          If it really is yours, you can call
          the police and tell 'em I stole
          it... In fact, I'm gonna call the
          police and report it...
          Joel walks towards the door. Then Cindy slumps down on the
          couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor,
          her voice cracking slightly.

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          Please don't...
          Joel stops.

          Please don't report it to the
          police. I'm on probation. I'll go
          to jail. For a long time.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Well... Maybe you should've thought
          about that before you started
          ripping off my employees.
          Joel starts to open the door.

</b>          Joel? Please? I'll leave Step
          alone. I promise. He'll drop the

          Joel considers this.

</b>          How do I know that?

<b>                         CINDY
</b>          You can keep the purse. If I don't
          leave him alone; if he doesn't drop

</b>          Hmm... I guess that ah... Do you
          have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's
          watch? Can I get those too?
          Beat. Cindy nods, still looking down. Joel considers it.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Well... Okay then. I guess that
          works.

<b>                         (REALIZING)

          you stole the purse. That's good,
          I guess... A step in the right
          direction...
          Joel sits down on the couch also. With her head still down,
          Cindy is weeping quietly. Joel doesn't notice, looking
          straight ahead.

          Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying. He's
          caught off guard.

</b>          .Ah... Cindy?
          Cindy breaks down and starts bawling.

</b>          Okay, now you see... that's what
          I'm talking about. You're trying
          to manipulate me now, and I'm not
          gonna fall for it...
          Cindy starts bawling even harder.

<b>                         JOEL (CONT'D)
</b>          I really hope you're not faking
          this right now, because I'm feeling
          really bad. Are you faking it?
          Cindy shakes her head "no."

          this...
          Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically.
          Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or
          comfort her in any way.

</b>          Never mind. I'm sorry...
          Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she
          leans in to him, crying on his chest.
          He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even
          closer. As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in
          even more. Finally, she lifts her head and they start

          We PULL OUT to reveal that he's alone in Cindy's bed. He
          sits up, yawns. He has a big satisfied smile on his face.

<b>                         JOEL

          He looks around, realizes he's alone. Then suddenly looks
          worried.

          He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he
          realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down the pants,
          then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the
          wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards. Then he
          looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse,
          Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side.
          He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Really? Bring him in.

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          No, he's outside. At the loading
          dock. Wants to talk to you alone
          back there for some reason.

<b>                         (CRUDE IMMITATION)
</b>          "Man to man."

<b>          EXT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - LOADING DOCK
</b>
          Step is pacing around, waiting. Joel comes out.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Hi Step...

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Hey.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          How you doin'? How's your, ah...

<b>                         STEP
</b>          (looking down at his

<b>                         CROTCH)
</b>          Oh it's okay. Some days it still
          hurts, but they've got me on some
          pills. It's not too bad I guess...

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          99.
</b>
<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Well... that's good.
          They both sit down on the edge of the dock.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Look, ah... Cindy left me.
          Joel's nods, not surprised, but sympathetic.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Wow... Bummer...

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Yeah, it is a bummer... You know, I
          thought the worst part was having
          my balls knocked off, but you know
          what the worse part is? Dealin'
          with all this bullshit... I'm sick
          of that Adler guy tellin' me what
          to do. He's a real dick.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah, he sure is.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          The truth is, I just want to have
          my old life back -- I just want to
          go back to work. I'm a workin'
          man; that's what I do.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah... I'm beginning to think I
          might be the same way... I'm a
          little worried about what I'd do
          with too much time on my hands.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          I just lay around and watch TV all
          day.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          The problem is, if I bankrupt the
          company, there won't be a job to go
          back to.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          You don't have to bankrupt the
          company.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          100.
</b>
<b>                         STEP
</b>          Yeah, but then if I drop the
          lawsuit, you'll sell the company,
          and the new company might not hire
          me.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Well, maybe I don't have to sell
          the company... You know I've been
          thinking; all these years I've been
          building this company, dreaming
          about the day I could sell it and
          retire, but what would I really do
          if I retired? It's like that old
          saying -- it's not about the
          destination, it's about the
          journey?
          Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I guess what I'm saying is, too
          much free time might not be such a
          good thing -- like that old saying,
          idle hands are the Devil's
          playground?
          Step's never heard that one either.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          I'm sorry, I don't do much book
          readin'.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          What I'm saying is, I'm thinking
          maybe I won't sell the company...

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Really?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          that is, if you dropped the
          lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll
          still get that insurance money --
          probably a couple hundred thousand.
          What do you think?

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Hmm. That sounds fair... But
          under one condition...

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          What's that?

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          101.
</b>
<b>                         STEP
</b>          You make me floor manager.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Deal.
          They shake hands.

<b>          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA
</b>
          Joel walks in with Step at his side. Addresses the
          employees.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Hold the line!
          Mary shuts off the conveyer belt.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Okay, listen up everybody.
          (Waits for them to settle)
          I've decided not to sell the
          company...
          Gasps and murmurs among the employees.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          And I'm making Step the new Floor
          Manager.
          More gasps and murmurs.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          And if anyone doesn't like it, I
          hear they're hiring over at
          Gemco... But just remember, at
          Gemco, the owner doesn't know your
          names; you never even meet him,
          he's at an office up in Chicago
          somewhere and you get an auto-
          response if you try to email him to
          complain about anything. Here, you
          can come up to my office any time
          you have a problem. Thanks.
          Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him.

<b>                         BRIAN
</b>          Huh? You're not selling?

<b>

<b>

</b>
<b>          102.
</b>
<b>                         JOEL
</b>          It's about the journey Brian. The
          journey.
          ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          You know, if Joel's going to put
          him in charge, we should go on
          strike. You know, at Gemco, the
          union handles the strikes and you
          don't even have to--
          PULL OUT as Step cuts her off.

<b>                         STEP
</b>          Quit yapping and get back to work
          or you're fired.
          Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and
          Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads.
          LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory.

<b>          INT. CHAPEL - DAY
</b>
          We are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OUT
          to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body.
          Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment and
          then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE,
          sitting by herself, dressed in black.

<b>          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
          Quick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the ground
          as the priest says the last few words.

<b>          EXT. CEMETERY - A LITTLE LATER
</b>
          People hug and console each other. Joel sees Suzie, walks
          over to her.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Hi... You doing okay?

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Yeah, I'm okay.

<b>

<b>          103.
</b>
<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I heard you were right there when
          it happened. That must've been
          rough.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          It was horrible Joel. He came over
          to ask for that check, and I
          just...
          Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING.

<b>                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
</b>          .I just lost it. I started
          yelling at him. I said horrible
          things. He had an aneurism and I
          probably caused it.

<b>                         (CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY)
</b>          I think the last thing I said to
          him was "shut up." Those were the
          last words he heard.
          Joel hugs her, consoling.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          It's okay, it's not your fault...
          It's not your fault.
          Suzie's crying subsides a little.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          It could happen to any of us Joel.
          Any of us could have an aneurism.
          We could die at any moment.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah, I know... I know... But we
          probably won't. It'll be alright.
          Suzie starts to regain her composure.
          They stand there for a beat.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          You wanna go get something to
          eat... or something?
          Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Yeah, okay. Sure.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>

<b>                         
</b>
<b>          104.
</b>          They walk off towards the cemetery gates. After a while,
          Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Here...

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Thanks.
          They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Maybe we should've been married in
          a Church like that one. Instead of
          the Botanical Gardens.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          I thought you liked the Botanical
          Gardens?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Yeah, but... a church just seems
          more -- I don't know -- official.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          You think it would've made a
          difference?

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I don't know... So, are we still
          married?

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Well, legally yes.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          I mean otherwise.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Hmmm... We can talk about it I
          suppose.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Alright.
          They walk for a beat.

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          You know, this is really bad,
          but... Oh never mind.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          What?

<b>

<b>                         JOEL
</b>          Well, as I was looking down at
          Nathan there, I was thinking...
          That's the longest I've ever seen
          him with his mouth shut.
          Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself.

<b>                         SUZIE
</b>          Joel!
          They walk off into the distance as we
