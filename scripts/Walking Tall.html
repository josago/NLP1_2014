               Inspired by a true story.

               We home in on a boat coming in to shore. Off walks a man, he 
               is carrying a backpack and wearing shades.

</b>
               He walks through a town, passing various stores and the general 
               bustle of the people there. He notices a baby in a pram left 
               out on the sidewalk, then sees the mother is in an alleyway doing 
               what looks like a drug deal.

               Chris reads a closure notice on the door. A police car rolls 
               up.

                         accepting bribes, setting speed traps 
                         all over town, cuttin up trucks. Not 
                         to mention the cavity searches.
