</b>
                             Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Amber and Jack head off towards the booth. CAMERA stays with Maurice,
follows him to the bar area, where he shouts some orders to a WAITER.

                      Clams on the half shell to Jack

                       and Amber -- over there -- go!

The WAITER takes off to the kitchen, Maurice walks onto the dance floor and
greets three people;

REED ROTHCHILD, 20s, tall and skinny, BECKY BARNETT, 20s, black girl in
silk, BUCK SWOPE, 20s, black guy in cowboy gear.

                            Great, great, great.

Maurice moves away to greet some more people. CAMERA stays with Reed, Becky
and Buck, does a 360 around them. Reed and Becky Disco Dance. Buck does
some Cowboy-Type Moves.

Moments later, the WAITER carrying clams on the half shell passes and
CAMERA picks up with him, follows him to Jack's booth, where he presents
them;

                             Seven-Up, here --

The WAITER exits, CAMERA PANS with him for a moment, leading to a young
girl wearing rollerskates, ROLLERGIRL (aged 18). She always, always wears
rollerskates. CAMERA PANS with her back to Jack's booth.

<b>                                 ROLLERGIRL

                              (to Rollergirl)

                       Did you call that girl today?

<b>                                 ROLLERGIRL

                                 I forgot.

<b>                                   AMBER
</b>
                   If you don't do it tomorrow, then it's

                  the weekend and you'll never be able to

                            get in to see her --

<b>                                 ROLLERGIRL
</b>
<b>                                    OK.
</b>
Rollergirl scratches her crotch as she speaks. Amber notices;

<b>                                   AMBER
</b>
                       What's the matter down there?

<b>                                 ROLLERGIRL

</b>
                               Well go, then.

CAMERA stays with Rollergirl, following her across the dance floor. She
passes Buck, Becky and Reed, says hello, dances a moment, then continues on
-- into the clearing off the dance floor, heading for the bathroom. She
passes something, CAMERA moves away towards this something:

A bus boy cleaning a table, EDDIE ADAMS, aged 17. CAMERA moves into a CU --
blending to SLOW MOTION (40fps) for a moment.

(Note: In the text Eddie Adams will be referred to as Dirk Diggler.)

<b>ANGLE, JACK'S TABLE.
</b>
Jack turns his head, looks across the dance floor and sees this kid
cleaning the table.

<b>ANGLE, DIRK DIGGLER.
</b>
He looks up, catches Jack looking back at him, then turns away, disappears
into a back room.

CAMERA DOLLIES in on Jack, who at that moment, is approached by a figure
entering FRAME. Short, buffed out LITTLE BILL (late 40s). This is Jack's
Assistant Director.

                       For sure? 'Cause I wanna call

                 Rocky, Scotty, Kurt and all those guys --

Jack's attention is with the backroom that Dirk entered. He stands and
heads away.

</b>
                   Absolutely. But I wanna keep it small.

                 women . . . the whole thing wraps up with

                  the Landlord, I'd like to get Jeremy if

                          I'll see you out there.

Scotty J. exits. Dirk stands, takes a deep breath. CAMERA follows as he
exits the room and walks through the house and into --

<b>54 INT. GARAGE/FILM SET
</b>
The crew is ready and waiting. Jack is there to greet him.

                               Let's do this.

They walk through the scene with Amber.

</b>
                  So we know the scene, we know the thing.

                    You're gonna start outside the set,

                   through that door, I'll call your name

             and action, that'll be your cue . . . come through

                the door, straight to the desk, right here,

                    boom, you and Amber do the scene --

Little Bill takes Dirk and walks him off the set, explaining things one
last time to him . . . CAMERA HOLDS ON DIRK. Little Bill walks away and
he's left standing alone a moment, waiting for his cue behind a closed
door. SILENCE. HOLD.

                          and . . . action, Dirk.

CAMERA blends to SLOW MOTION (30fps) and FOLLOWS Dirk through the door and
into the set -- lights flare into CAMERA/DIRK and we focus in on Amber,
seated behind a desk. CAMERA blends back to 24fps.

KURT LONGJOHN'S 16mm CAMERA POV:

Dirk enters. A light shines straight at him. He walks into a two shot with
Amber at the desk. BEAT, THEN:

                 Well, I spent three years in the Marines.

                    I just got back from a tour of duty.

                 I'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment.

                        My landlord is a real jerk.

</b>
                     Why don't you take your pants off?

              It's important that I get an idea of your size.

<b>                                    DIRK
</b>
                                No problem.

Dirk starts to remove his pants . . . just before they come off we go to:

<b>JACK AND THE REST OF THE CREW
</b>
Kurt Longjohn takes his eye away from the viewfinder for a moment. Rocky
frowns slightly. Scotty J. is in shock. Reed and Becky smile.

Amber looks from Dirk's cock to his face.

<b>                                   AMBER
</b>
                      I think that you have the part,

                but why don't I make sure of something . . .

16mm CAMERA'S POV:

for the first time, we see Dirk's cock. It hangs about 12 inches. Amber's
hand reaches and grabs hold of it --

<b>                                   AMBER
</b>
                           This is a giant cock.

So they go at it . . . taking each other's clothes off and climbing up on
the desk . . . OUR CAMERA is hand held, moving around, looking at the crew
filming and Dick/Amber making love . . . .

They continue for a while. Jack whispers something to Kurt, then walks over
to Dirk and Amber, quietly interrupts;

</b>
                     Hang in there, everything's cool,

                      I just wanna change the angle --

                            You're doin' great.

Amber looks to Dirk. They hold still;

<b>                                   AMBER

                        You're doin' so good, Dirk.

                             Does it feel good?

Amber smiles. Jack and Kurt have set up a new angle;

<b>                                    JACK
</b>
                Okay -- we're back, we're ready -- action --

They continue for a bit, getting faster and a little harder;

they're face to face. Following in sotto:

Amber and Dirk come together. HOLD. They kiss and smile.

THE CREW APPLAUDS THE PERFORMANCE. Everyone gathers around. Dirk is giving
hand shakes, high fives, etc.

CAMERA PANS over to Little Bill and Jack who step aside a moment. Following
in sotto;

                      Yes it was. What do you want to

                      do about the come shot? We could

                go to the stock footage -- get a close up --

                       It's not gonna match, we don't

                      have a cock that big on film --

Dirk hears this and turns to Jack and Little Bill.

                  Jack Horner has found something special

                   in newcomer Dirk Diggler. It's another

             stellar, sexual standout from Horner and Company.

              Diggler delivers a performance worth a thousand

              hard-ons. His presence when dressed is powerful

                            and demanding . . .

                    So let's talk about what video means

                     to this industry -- and let's talk

              Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man.

                  I like cinema. In particular, I like to

             . . . yeah, yeah, yeah . . . You look good, ready.

Dirk does some quick KARATE moves, then turns his BACK TO THE CAMERA. He
unzips his pants, looks down at his cock. His body starts to move a little,
slowly at first then faster as he tries to masturbate.

in the mirror with his pants down, speaking to himself;

                  Initially, Andrew went with his father,

<b>                                   AMBER
</b>
                    This is not right. My son was never

                    exposed to pornographic material or

                  drugs or any of these things, my husband

                              just assumed --

<b>SUDDENLY:

A PICK-UP TRUCK carrying THREE PUNK KIDS SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES IN FRONT OF
DIRK IN THE TOYOTA. Dirk looks up in shock, turns his head to the Surfer
Kid who says;

</b>
                You shouldn't do this sort of thing, faggot.

They continue to yell and scream and kick and punch Dirk and eventually
peel out of the parking lot. Dirk moans and cries and holds his stomach in
pain. He coughs up some blood and vomit . .

<b>169 INT. DONUT SHOP - NIGHT

Buck enters and looks at some donuts, helped by the DONUT BOY behind the

eating a donut and some coffee, reading 'Guns and Ammo.'

<b>                                 DONUT BOY

Donut Boy starts to empty the safe, putting the money in a paper sack . . .
Buck is frozen . . .

The MIDDLE AGED MAN in the corner reaches into his coat pocket and pulls
out an extremely BIG GUN . . .

The Middle Aged Man SHOOTS the Puerto Rican Kid in the BACK . . .

. . . the Puerto Rican Kid turns and returns FIRE, hitting the Middle Aged
Man with a bullet in the FACE . . .

. . . The Middle Aged Man gets another wild SHOT off before he expires and
that bullet hits the Donut Boy in the CHEST . . .

So: The Donut Boy is dead, The Puerto Rican Kid falls to the floor dead and
the Middle Aged Man is face down dead in his donut and coffee . . .

Blood is ALL OVER Buck . . . he stands for a long moment . . .

                             Hello. Come on in.

The bodyguard leads them down a hall and into a tacky and spacious, sunken
<b>LIVING ROOM.
</b>
They're greeted by a man in a silk robe, slightly open to show some bikini
briefs and a thin sheen of sweat covering his body: RAHAD JACKSON (late
40s).

Off in a corner of the room, a YOUNG ASIAN KID is casually throwing some
FIRECRACKERS around.

Rahad is DANCING around by himself to NIGHT RANGER, "SISTER CHRISTIAN." He
spots the men;

                                 (to Dirk)

                          This song is so amazing.

</b>
                    That's good. No problem, cool, cool.

The Bodyguard brings over a PAPER BAG FULL OF CASH and hands the bag to
Todd in exchange for the PAPER BAG FULL OF BAKING SODA.

Reed watches the Bodyguard take the bag and notices something. REED'S POV:
a SHOULDER HOLSTER holds a .45 Automatic Pistol.

Rahad does an air guitar solo to the Night Ranger song . . . he walks
across the room, picks up a COKE PIPE and looks to the guys;

<b>                                   RAHAD

</b>
                               No thank you.

Rahad strokes the pipe while dancing. Dirk looks across to an open bedroom
door.

DIRK'S POV: Through the crack in the door, we can see a bloody, battered

              order and they try and say how you should listen

                    to the songs, but I don't like that.

                   I don't like to be told what to listen
