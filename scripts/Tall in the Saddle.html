               CLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads:

               CAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small 
               Arizona town of the late nineties.

               CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures, 
               consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans 
               and a mongrel dog.

               CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the 
               office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair 
               with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The 
               clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens 
               his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his 
               feet sleepily.

               line of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a 
               distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now 
               might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera.

               line of sleeping figures. The dog jumps up barking furiously 
               and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come 
               to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door 
               of the ticket office opens and the agent appears.

</b>
               FULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge 
               of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly 
               in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man 
               of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots 
               and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of 
               day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind 
               Rocklin a conductor.

               the car with two sacks of mail. He drops them to the platform 
               and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors 
               of the baggage car.

               on Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the 
               engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow 
               of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's 
               face.

               As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in 
               one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the 
               other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits 
               from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His 
               expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of 
               the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. 
               At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around 
               uncertainly.

                         I guess not. Where's the stagecoach 
                         office?

                         Back of the depot.

<b>               EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
</b>
               The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a 
               sign --

<b>                                      RED ROCK STAGE
</b>
                                  J. Harolday Proprietor

               Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the 
               depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, 
               the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead 
               horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees 
               Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances 
               around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's 
               lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is 
               knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. 
               Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds 
               amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- 
               beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and 
               exhibits his utter disgust generally.

<b>                                     DAVE

                         Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- 
                         jus' lookit what you done --
                              (some more pantomime)
                         I'm tellin' you, Blossom that --
                              (indicating broken 
                              bottle)
                         -- makes you the most aggravatin' 
                         female as ever I had a despise fer -- 
                         I've got a good notion to pizen you -- 
                         an' what's more --

               He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by 
               chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has 
               forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his 
               bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks 
               it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the 
               bottle.

<b>                                     DAVE

                         Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? --
                              (chuckles)
                         Fooled myself, too.

<b>               ON ROCKLIN
</b>
               who has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his 
               amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office.

<b>               INT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
</b>
               PAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind 
               which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble-
               lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up 
               the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks 
               on the counter and leaves.

                         That the stage for Santa Inez?

                         Leaving any minute.

               Rocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad 
               of bills, drops them on the counter. The Stage Agent counts 
               out the fare.

</b>                         Rocklin.

               The Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes 
               some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances 
               outside.

</b>                              (over his specs)
                         It's all right with me -- if it's 
                         all right with Dave -- He's mad -- 
                         His last trip -- Had a row with 
                         Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer, 
                         Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss.

                         I like grumpy old cusses -- Hope to 
                         live long enough to be one.

</b>                              (puzzled)
                         Yeah?

               He shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves 
               over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand.

<b>               EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
</b>
               The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from 
               the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of 
               climbing up to the driver's seat.

<b>                                     STAGE AGENT
</b>                         Here's your mail, Dave --

               Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the 
               ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat.

<b>                                     ROCKLIN
</b>                              (as he steps up to 
                              the seat)
                         -- and a passenger.

               Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is 
               about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down 
               at him and asks rather wistfully --

<b>                                     ROCKLIN
</b>                         Mind if I ride up here?

               Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step 
               carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does 
               things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin 
               is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And 
               now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his 
               pent-up wrath.

                         Why ain't they here? -- This is the

                         folks?

               Dave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime 
               stretches himself up toward Rocklin.

                         prayin' for miles.

               Dave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away, 
               leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously.

               From the porch of the hotel. We see the stage approaching as 
               the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from 
               the hotel to the street. The coach pulls up and stops.

                         for you to carry 'em out?

               Before the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by 
               someone calling his name from across the street. Meantime, 
               an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow, 
               etc. Rocklin buys bow and arrow.

               Miss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a 
               gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk. The women 
               are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste 
               of the period. Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching 
               middle age. Her niece, Clara, is a well-bred, attractive

               perceive the disaster. He makes no move, however, to advise

               a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches. 
               Standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a

               garments of unrecognizable origin. On the counter is a 
               travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an 
               assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and 
               shovel. As Dave enters, the man (Zeke) turns around and 
               reveals a face even hairier than Dave's.

               Judge Garvey in foreground has been watching Rocklin, as if 
               trying to sum him up. He now leans forward with an 
               ingratiating smile.

                         friend here has been holding 
                         phenomenal cards.

               Rocklin smiles and begins to shake his head.

                         for real money.

               Rocklin turns very slowly and stares at Clint. The others 
               watch curiously. Without taking his eyes off Clint, he comes 
               forward slowly and stands looking down at him. Then, 
               unbuttoning the flap of his pocket, he takes out the wad of 
               bills and drops it on the table, at the same time sinking 
               into the chair vacated by Sammy. The tension amongst the 
               onlookers relaxes and Clint grins at Garvey and winks 
               significantly.

               Pap Fossler is dealing. There is an atmosphere of tension 
               around the table, and it is obvious that Clint has been 
               losing. As he picks up his cards, he is unable to restrain a 
               smile of triumph. Rocklin makes a bet. Pap Fossler and the 
               man next to him fold immediately.

               He stares challengingly at Rocklin. Rocklin takes out a 
               wallet, from which he removes a bill and sees the raise.

               He reaches for it almost before it is dealt and as a result 
               the card, a Queen, falls face up. Clint looks at it gleefully, 
               snatches it up and puts it in his hand. Rocklin watches him 
               impassively.

               Rocklin glances inquiringly at the other players. All are 
               dead-panned, unwilling to interfere. Rocklin looks toward 
               Cap, who stands near him.

               Clint's and in addition takes from his wallet more bills.

               jumps up, draws his gun and thrusts it almost into Rocklin's 
               face. The other players roll away from the line of fire.

               He sinks the whiskey and begins to pour himself another. At 
               the same time, the swing-doors open and Bob Clews comes 
               through. AS Rocklin raises the glass to his lips, Bob Clews 
               hits him on the back, causing him to spill the whisky.

               There is a moment's pause. Then with a slow, grim smile of 
               satisfaction, Rocklin turns and knocks Bob Clews off his 
               feet.

               free of the holster, Rocklin brings his heel down on Clews' 
               wrist, grinding on it with his whole weights. Then, kicking 
               the gun out of reach, Rocklin steps back. Bob Clews sits up, 
               clutching his wrist and weaving back and forth.

               Clint Harolday is seen at the window peering furtively toward 
               the Sun-Up Saloon. He suddenly notices something o.s. which 
               prompts him to say something which we of course cannot hear. 
               Now Garvey appears at the window.

               Garvey and Clint, at the window. From their expressions it

               He takes out a letter and hands it to Garvey. The latter 
               takes it slowly, handling it as if it were dangerous. He 
               looks from the letter to Rocklin and back again. Then 
               reluctantly, he opens it and begins to read.

               LETTER -- It reads:

               Dear Mr. Rocklin:

               Glad you have made up your mind to take the job. Enclosed 
               find train fare and $150 advance on wages.

                         George Clews is in town. He's seen

               They all look quickly toward the window.

               Dave turns and looks curiously at Rocklin, who frowns 
               impatiently.

                         in front of the saloon.

               The place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of 
               expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. A 
               group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office. 
               At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging 
               doors. The bar supports other customers engaged in various 
               private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of 
               George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's 
               center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of 
               him. He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the 
               others, but regards them all with disdain. He downs his drink, 
               and speaks his thought to Bob.

               Suddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and 
               halts with the swinging doors half open.

                         Hi you, George Clews --

               George Clews turns.

</b>                         Rocklin says if you don't come out, 
                         he'll come in here after you, an' 
                         tear you apart.

               George Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size 
               glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, 
               standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to 
               the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap, 
               anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from 
               under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty.

                         If he comes in again -- I'll throw 
                         you.

               Before Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the 
               little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that 
               sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him 
               struggling to get his hat off. The crowd resents this, but 
               doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun 
               in sight.

               George and Bob Clews are now a few steps from the bar. They 
               have turned as Cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun.

               As George Clews steps outside, a mangy mongrel dog, basking 
               close by, evidently recognizes him and tails it away, leaving 
               George blinking at him.

               He steps down from the sidewalk into the street and then

               slowly forward, his eyes fixed on George's.

               enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it 
               crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes 
               though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole-

               He turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the 
               stage office completely ignoring Jackson, who rides alongside 
               blusteringly.

                         find yourself in trouble.

               The crowd which has been following now begins to razz him 
               openly. He turns and glares, but without effect. He gives a 
               final shout to Rocklin.

               hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and 
               then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns 
               his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile, 
               she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by 
               Juan. He looks after her for a second; then with the same

               Rocklin, upon reaching the front of the stage office, pauses

               something sarcastic. Then, repressing herself, she wheels 
               her horse and canters off along the side of the copse. Rocklin 
               throws an amused glance, at Juan, who has been watching with 
               an enigmatic expression. He returns Rocklin's look with a 
               stern, menacing frown. Then, with a gentle flick of the rein,

               other things, does not take particular notice of the pouch, 
               but we cannot help notice the pouch ornament -- a steer's 
               head of hammered silver.

                         Senor, that is true. I do not like

               Rocklin shakes his head. Juan, having spilled tobacco in a 
               paper, now puts away the pouch and rolls his own.

<b>               EXT. TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is 
               discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint 
               open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch 
               to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for 
               someone.

               Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with 
               his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over 
               his shoulder.

<b>                                     CLINT
</b>                              (turning to Shelley)
                         Have you seen Arly?

<b>                                     SHELLEY
</b>                         No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly 
                         today, but Ah seed her las' night, 
                         and she shore was mad.

               To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a 
               whistle.

<b>                                     SHELLEY
</b>                         Plenty mad!

               Clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for 
               him. Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of 
               a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune 
               of the period. Clint's strained features relax in a can-that-
               be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle 
               of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house, 
               while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side. 
               Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and 
               Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine 
               way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is 
               wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now, 
               adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly 
               startles her. The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall 
               quickly away from the flower.

<b>               ARLY
</b>
               As Arly moves toward the porch, Shelley snaps back to life 
               and resumes sweeping -- but furiously. Clint regards the 
               girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is.

<b>                                     CLINT
</b>                              (not too definitely)
                         'Mornin', Arly --

               Arly is coming toward Clint.

</b>                              (pleasantly)
                         'Mornin', Clint.

               She steps close to Clint, and he slowly backs up a step, for 
               he does not know she came up to him merely to pick up her 
               jacket lying on the ground near the step.

<b>                                     CLINT
</b>                              (as Arly leans down 
                              to pick up the jacket)
                         You must be feeling pretty good.

               Arly straightens up with the jacket in her hand, and the 
               corner of her mouth curls in a faint smile. She turns now 
               and starts along the walk, and takes only a few steps when 
               Clint comes to her side.

                         night before last, I ---

                         Forget it?

               Arly pays no attention to Clint. She is looking o.s. and 
               stops walking.

               Tala, on his horse, as seen by Arly. Over the scene comes 
               Arly's voice calling from a distance.

<b>                                     ARLY
</b>                              (calling)
                         Tala.

               Tala reacts to the call by heading his horse at a slightly 
               different angle.

<b>               ARLY AND CLINT
</b>
               Arly is looking o.s. toward Tala. Clint is now eyeing his 
               sister up and down quite openly. She turns her head now and 
               catches Clint looking her over.

<b>                                     ARLY
</b>                              (after a stilted pause)
                         Well --

                              smile)
                         What is this? --

               A gesture of his hand indicates the way Arly has gotten 
               herself up. That quick, Arly's hand goes to the flower in 
               her hair. And, that quick, she guiltily withdraws it.

               Before he can explain, Tala pulls up in his horse and we 
               hear his voice over the scene.

<b>                                     TALA'S VOICE

               Tala sitting astride his horse smiles down at the girl.

                         today.

               Arly is jolted by Tala's innocent remark, and she can't help 
               giving Clint a little side glance in the way of reaction. 
               Clint has not missed Tala's crack nor Arly's glance, and 
               when she gives it to him he says:

                         See what I mean?

               He tosses her an altogether knowing look now, and leaves, 
               going up the walk toward the house. Arly turns to Tala.

<b>                                     ARLY

                              (then as a casual

                         You can have that Rocklin bring it.

               She glances over her shoulder toward Clint going up the walk. 
               And then, looking back to Tala, finds he hasn't moved, but 
               remains smiling down at her.

               Arly looks away. Her eyes stare blankly into space as she 
               struggles with the mixed emotions of anger and disappointment. 
               Tala, aware of her plight, slowly dismounts and comes to the

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK and Rocklin is revealed at the table, 
               looking down at the letter. His hat is tipped back on his 
               head, and his sleeves are rolled up. He is mixing dough in a 
               bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are 
               all gooey. Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where 
               his outer shirt and socks are drying. It is dark outside, 
               but the storm has abated. Rocklin goes to a shelf near the 
               fireplace to get a pan.

               biscuits and putting it in the pan.

               Rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way Dave includes 
               himself in.

                         able to sleep.

               Dave screws up his face in utter disgust and turns his 
               attention to his drying clothes.

               Rocklin, meanwhile, takes a flour sack from the table, wipes 
               the dough from his hands and picks up the letter. He goes 
               over to the fireplace, opening the letter the while, and 
               sits on the bench. Dave, seeing this, edges discreetly around 
               in back of Rocklin in order to see over his shoulder.

               The letter open, Rocklin takes out a roll of bills along 
               with the folded message. He lays the envelope on the bench.

               Rocklin places the money in his shirt pocket for the moment, 
               and opens the folded message.

               LETTER. It begins with the usual Dear Mr. Rocklin.

               Rocklin's voice is heard over the insert as he reads from

               Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the

               Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl 
               hoots in a near-by tree.

               The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the 
               corral. Both men re-act.

               from another direction entirely -- and from a distance.

               Dave close behind.

               Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires.

               The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night.

               toward the cabin.

<b>               DAVE - PLOUGHING THROUGH THE GRASS
</b>
               He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight 
               embankment leads to the level of the trees. He is just 
               starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something 
               on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. It proves to be 
               a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver. 
               It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. Dave pockets 
               it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail.

<b>               ROCLKLIN - WHO HAS JUST ABOUT REACHED THE CABIN
</b>
               He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward 
               the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses.

<b>               THE CABIN DOOR IS PARTLY OPEN
</b>
               and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form 
               moving in the faint glow of the dying fire.

<b>               ROCKLIN DRAWS HIS GUN AND MOVES STEALTHILY TOWARDS THE CABIN 
</b><b>               DOOR
</b>
<b>               INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches 
               the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the 
               fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. He sees 
               the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in 
               the light of the fire. He sees him suddenly stop and pick up 
               something hidden from his view.

               At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut.

               The intruder whirls around.

               It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant.

               The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same 
               cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it.

               And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly -- 
               but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his.

               When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind 
               her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously 
               Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to 
               open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to 
               prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand. 
               But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without 
               any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses 
               it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly relaxes 
               her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and 
               tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her 
               feet.

               He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the 
               floor.

               Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And 
               Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his hat 
               and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the 
               bullet holes.

<b>                                     ROCKLIN

</b>                              (right back at him)
                         You think I did that?

<b>                                     ROCKLIN

                              (looks at his hat)
                         You know, you cut it mighty close -- 
                         Good thing I ain't got brains enough 
                         to fill it.

               Rocklin puts his hat on. He sees Arly looking down at the 
               torn letter.

</b>                         The man who shot at you.

               Rocklin sits on the bunk and casually picks up Arly's knife.

<b>                                     ROCKLIN
</b>                         Who was he?

                         lie to you?

               That last from Arly brings a kind of smile to Rocklin's face -- 
               a smile that says in effect -- "Are you kidding?" He gets up 
               from the bunk to go to the door, and finding himself still 
               holding Arly's knife, throws it back to her in a seemingly 
               casual manner. It passes too close to Arly for comfort and, 
               Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back -- 
               that close to his ear he feels the breeze. He looks at it, 
               quivering in the door. Then, moving to Arly in what could be 
               construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms 
               and kisses her. Arly is caught completely unaware. Rocklin's 
               action disarms her. But it is, after all, what she really 
               wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwine 
               themselves around Rocklin's neck. In the middle of the kiss 
               Rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his 
               neck and puts her from him.

                         me.

               He goes to the bunk -- picks up his saddlebag, coat, etc., 
               and starts for the door.

               Arly has been silently watching.

               Dave's voice is heard just outside the cabin door.

               Rocklin gives Arly a disparaging side glance and starts out.

               Arly, her back to us, is standing in the open doorway watching 
               the two headed for the corral.

               Her mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly 
               slams shut the door. As she turns and leans against it, we 
               see tears in her eyes, and hear suppressed sobs. Her eyes 
               light on the bits of torn letter, and presently we see her 
               face set itself grimly, and now she walks toward the fireplace 
               and, passing the torn bite of paper, kicks at them viciously.

                         about it.

                         Any idea who might have done it?

               of the Sun-Up). He knocks. Almost immediately the door opens

<b>               DEAR MR. GARVEY:
</b>
               In answer to your letter of the 25th, kindly be advised that 
               my niece, Clara Caldwell, became of age January 11th of this 
               year. And, although I am no longer her legal guardian, it 
               behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest 
               in her affairs --

               The CAMERA HOLDS LONG ENOUGH for the letter to be read. And 
               now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK showing the burning letter in Judge Garvey's hand. 
               He is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and 
               Miss Martin is close to him watching the letter burn. Garvey 
               finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the 
               stove. He lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and 
               smiles to Miss Martin.

               door.

               Garvey shakes his head, wipes his brow, and is returning to 
               his desk.

               SHOT -- door to Garvey's office. Miss Martin has her ear 
               glued to the panels. Over scene comes Rocklin's voice.

               Rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer 
               marked "C." As he fingers through the papers, Garvey sits 
               back in his chair, watching.

<b>                                     GARVEY

</b>                         My only interest is getting' it.

</b>                         You realize what this is, don't you? -- 
                         Robbing -- armed robbery at that.

               Rocklin pulls open the "M" drawer.

<b>                                     GARVEY
</b>                         I warn you, you're in for a 
                         disappointment.

               Not finding the letter in the "M" drawer, Rocklin goes to 
               the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers. It is 
               locked.

                              himself)
                         There's nothing in there that'd 
                         interest you.

</b>                              (grimly)
                         I'd like to make up my own mind about 
                         that.

<b>                                     GARVEY
</b>                              (forces a chuckle)
                         All right -- I'll open it -- just to 
                         convince you I'm not hiding any 
                         letter.

               Garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it. It is found to contain 
               nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards.

               The UNOPENED DECKS OF CARDS.

               BACK TO SCENE. Garvey seems a little too anxious to close 
               the drawer, and before he can do so, Rocklin has one hand 
               inside. Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin.

<b>                                     GARVEY
</b>                         What's the idea?

               Rocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks.

<b>                                     ROCKLIN
</b>                         These cards --

<b>                                     GARVEY
</b>                              (attempting to bluff 
                              it out)
                         Anything wrong in a man having cards 
                         in his possession?

<b>                                     ROCKLIN
</b>                         Depends on what kind they are -- 
                         'specially when they're under lock 
                         and key.

               The two regard each other silently a moment. Now Rocklin 
               casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket.

<b>                                     GARVEY

</b>                         That's right.

               He takes a step away. Garvey turns him by touching his arm.

                         He found out about these -- and you 
                         went and killed him.

                              in his pocket)
                         I'll just take this along -- the 
                         district judge at Garden City should 
                         be mighty interested.

               He starts around the desk toward the door. From the corner 
               of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle 
               drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a 
               blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove.

               Rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being 
               struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The 
               chair crashes against a window.

               The sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers-

               It is pretty well wrecked. Rocklin has Garvey just about 
               done in. He gives him one final Sunday punch and Garvey goes 
               down and stays down. At that moment, Dave and Pap Fossler 
               enter followed by other curious natives.

                              gone over to Garvey)

                         I reckon the Judge did, too.

               They exit, and almost immediately Miss Martin enters, and 
               after gaping in horror at the appearance of the place, sees 
               the Judge, who, having regained consciousness, bestirs himself 
               on the floor.

<b>                                     MISS MARTIN

                         Get out of my way --

               Garvey, on his feet now, makes for the door leading to his 
               living quarters at the back of the office. Miss Martin follows 
               him.

                         I'll have you understand I --

               She sees the bed and shrieks upon realizing where she is, 
               and backs out quickly, almost catching the door which Garvey 
               slams in her face.

               a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides.

               Dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage 
               office. Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up.

               PANNING SHOT. Juan is lounging against the corner of the 
               building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach. As Rocklin 
               comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as 
               though deciding whether or not to question him. During this, 
               Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his 
               pocket and begins to roll a cigarette.

               The CAMERA PANS Rocklin to the side of the building and up 
               the outer stairs.

               Rocklin comes through the door and down the hall. He reaches 
               his room, and is about to open the door when he hears a 
               familiar voice inside. He listens.

               Rocklin steps into the room, holding the door partly open as

               She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's

               pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more 
               terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the 
               girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across 
               the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even 
               stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.

               Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's

               around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the 
               stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward 
               the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala 
               come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact 
               position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a 
               moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, 
               and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of

               An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness 
               toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the 
               CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins 
               stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the 
               rungs.

               The CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of 
               Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch 
               the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of 
               vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across 
               the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear

               Rocklin slaps Clint's face open-handed, throwing him off 
               balance, then grabs him by the shirt front.

               Completely terrified, Clint opens his mouth as if about to 
               speak. Suddenly he sees something out of the shot over 
               Rocklin's shoulder and his expression changes. Rocklin looks 
               quickly in the same direction.

               window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug 
               from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As 
               Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a 
               triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes.

               There is a shot from o.s. and Clint's hands go to his stomach. 
               With a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor.

               Lined up at the bar are Dave, Pap Fossler, Shorty Davis and 
               a few others. Cap is in his usual place. At the poker table 
               are Doc Riding, Sam Haynes, Ab Jenkins and one or two others.

               The shot has evidently been heard, for everything seems to 
               have stopped, and Dave and Pap Fussier are looking up toward 
               the ceiling, as are others. Now Dave snaps back to life -- 
               gulps down his drink, and hurries toward the stairs. As he 
               starts up, the others move slowly in the same direction.

<b>               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
</b>
               Rocklin is on the floor, groggy. He shakes his head, and as 
               his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his 
               feet as Dave rushes in.

               Dave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in 
               Rocklin's hand. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes 
               out. All he can do is stare and grimace. The sound of hurrying 
               feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in, 
               crowding the room and the hall.

               Pap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels 
               over Clint.

               During this, there are general ad libs from the crowd.

               He steps back so no one is behind him. And there is something 
               about his manner and tone that urges Jackson to use 
               discretion.

               He moves over to the open window, and with his gun leveled 
               on the mob, steps out onto the verandah. Once outside, he 
               suddenly lets the window fall and disappears. A shot from 
               Jackson's gun shatters a pane, during which time there has 
               been a rush to the window. It is Arly and Dave who reach it 
               first, and feigning an attempt to raise the window, they 
               momentarily delay pursuit.

               SHOOTING INTO the room, we see Arly and Dave shoved to one 
               side by Jackson and Garvey. The window goes up and Jackson 
               steps out, followed by Garvey, Harolday, Arly, Dave, and

               or so horses tied up to it and close to it is Dave's team 
               and wagon. Rocklin comes from around the corner of the

               Jackson and Garvey come from around the corner of the porch 
               followed by Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others. At the stairs 
               they collide with some of the men who have raced down the 
               hall, only to reach the stairway at the same moment. There 
               is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down 
               at once.

               He has cut the lines of the horses tied to the rail. We see

               rare and stampede.

               Sammy, the China-boy, is nervously knocking on Miss Martin's 
               door. It opens and Miss Martin is seen slipping a robe over 
               her long Mother Hubbard nightgown, with cap to match.

                         Now -- what is it?

               Sammy points o.s. -- Miss Martin looks and freezes.

               As she moves down the hall, the CAMERA PANS WITH her until 
               it gets two men standing near the entrance door.

               Now the CAMERA MOVES IN TO A THREE SHOT and we recognize 
               George Clews and his brother, Bob. Bob, his wrist bandaged, 
               takes off his hat at Miss Martin's approach, and George 
               noticing, does likewise.

               Clara is seen in her nightgown, listening at the door to her 
               room. The sound of the outer door closing comes over the 
               scene and she hurries to her bed and feigns sleep, and just 
               in time, for the door opens and Miss Martin sticks her head 
               in, and satisfied that Clara is sleeping, exits.

               A raspy voice is heard coming out of the darkness singing a 
               ribald song of the periods. And now Old Zeke, riding his 
               burro, comes into view. As he passes close to the camera, we 
               PAN and get the posse coming out of the darkness in the 
               opposite direction Zeke is travelling.

               As the posse pulls up to Zeke, the CAMERA MOVES IN on a group

               Arly watches the posse, then turns to Juan.

               as an idea begins to take form in her mind. Now she hurries 
               out of bed, moves stealthily to the door and goes out, leaving

               ON door to Miss Martin's room. Clara comes down the hall to 
               the door. She puts her ear close and listens. Now she opens 
               it cautiously and peers inside. The door to her room is 
               slammed o.s. by a sporadic draft. It startles the girl and 
               she quickly closes Miss Martin's door and hurries away.

               further pleading and now moves his horse out after Arly.

               We pick up Clara in the act of nervously pinning on her hat 
               in the dim light of a small lamp. She is fully dressed, and 
               once the hat is on, she looks around anxiously for her top 
               coat which she finds in the closet. She takes the coat and 
               starts hurriedly toward the lamp, sitting on a small taboret 
               near the door. As she bends over to blow it out, her eyes

               If Dave keeps quiet any longer he'll burst. He spins Rocklin 
               around and speaks in his natural voice.

               From Rocklin's expression it is quite apparent to Dave that 
               he is right.

               She utters a stifled scream and, seeing Rocklin starting 
               through the window, runs from the room.

               The sound of running horses comes over the scene as Harolday

               He starts to mount, but instead leads the horse into the

               smile at Miss Martin's reference to him. Dave is behind the 
               curtain at the window, watching the outside. Clara is close

               Harolday looks at Juan, who slowly nods.

               He brings up the tobacco pouch. But before he can ask about 
               it, Arly speaks.

                         Didn't you?

               Juan nods.

               Rocklin, with a sudden transition, speaks to Harolday in a 
               hard, threatening tone.

                         Why did you kill Caldwell?

               Harolday doesn't answer. He finally looks at Garvey in 
               desperation. Perspiration runs down Garvey's forehead. 
               Suddenly Harolday makes a mad dash for the door. Rocklin 
               shoots, but Arly pushes his arm and sends the shot wild. 
               Rocklin looks at her in amazement. Julio hurries out.

               the bushes where his horse waits.

               The CAMERA SWINGS BACK to the porch in time to catch Julio 
               crossing it in pursuit of Harolday. Arly and Rocklin come 
               through the open door and stand on the porch watching.

               They see Julio disappear in the brush. For a moment nothing 
               happens; now Harolday's horse bolts out, riderless, and 
               gallops away. Now Julio comes slowly into view. He moves 
               slowly and deliberately back toward the house.

<b>               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
</b>
               In the hall are Clara and Miss Martin, Rocklin, Arly and 
               Julio, Dave and Garvey. Garvey is seated and has evidently 
               been talking in the way of confession.

                         wanted the Santee and the Hardman 
                         place, for his land scheme -- He 
                         planned on breaking up the ranches 
                         into small holdings and selling to 
                         dirt farmers. He pretended to be on 
                         the outs with me so I could get 
                         Caldwell's confidence. And when Red 
                         caught me with the crooked cards and 
                         threatened to expose me -- Harolday 
                         shot him.

                         You vile -- wicked -- despicable --

               She is beside herself in her anger -- and taking up a large 
               vase sitting nearby, she smashes it to pieces over Garvey's 
               head. Garvey goes down unconscious. Miss Martin rushes to 
               her room screaming. Clara follows her.

                         And I'll bet you're just the one who 
                         can do it.

                         I know I am.

               He starts away down the hall, rolling up his sleeves. 
               Rocklin's eyes wander to Clara, who seems quite at a loss. 
               Now he moves slowly toward her. In the b.g. Arly watches 
               Rocklin's every move.

               After a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of Arly, 
               Clara speaks.

               There is another short pause. Rocklin glances at Arly, and 
               Arly assuming they want to be alone, turns and goes out the 
               door, leaving Julio attending Garvey.

               now and walks out.

               Arly is seated on the shaft of an old wagon. The first rays 
               of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as 
               she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck 
               cavorting on the ground close to her. In a moment Rocklin 
               comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back 
               to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck 
               away, and turns Arly's head toward him. Neither has anything 
               to say. Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other 
               way.
