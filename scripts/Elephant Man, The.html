               CLOSE-UP of a gold framed miniature portrait of JOHN MERRICK'S 
               MOTHER (tune or melody over her picture, heartbeat), which 
               DISSOLVES TO CLOSE-UP of real Mother smiling A shadow comes 
               over her face. CLOSE-UP of elephant ears, trunks, faces 
               moving.

               Dark, heavy feet stomping elephant trumpet, rearing up.

               Powerful hit and the Mother falls. Darker. Trunk slides over 
               Mother's face and breasts and stomach, leaving a moist trail.

               MOTHERâ€™S POV of elephant's mouth, eyes, skin. Mother's face 
               twists and freezes in a blurred snap roll.

               BLACK again. Knock, knock sound. Curtain opens to horrified 
               faces.

               FADE IN TO steam shooting out of a huge old half-rusted 
               calliope. The music is very loud and raucous. Moving up and 
               back we see the black awning entrance to the freak tent, 
               where FREDERICK TREVES, Resident Surgeon and Lecturer on 
               anatomy at the London Hospital, is standing with his back to 
               us observing the posters of the freaks.

               Coming along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is 
               Treves' wife, ANNE, and their two DAUGHTERS. The shrill over-
               whelming music seems to engulf her.

               She looks discomfited, vulnerable, and protective of her 
               daughters. The girls, oblivious to any fear, are finishing 
               their chocolate sweets.

               CLOSE-UP of Treves looking at a poster.

               He hears:

<b>                                     #1 DAUGHTER
</b>                         Poppa!

               Treves turns and looks down to a chocolate-covered face. He 
               smiles at the children and Anne.

               Anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them. 
               The other daughter looks into the freak tent.

<b>                                     #2 DAUGHTER
</b>                         Poppa... may we go in there?

<b>                                     ANNE
</b>                         Alright... Your turn.

               She turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins 
               cleaning her face.

               Her kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughter's face. 
               Suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the distance.

<b>                                     #2 DAUGHTER

</b>                         Oh, elephants! We'll go see them.

               She stands.

<b>                                     ANNE
</b>                              (to Treves)
                         You won't be long?

<b>                                     TREVES
</b>                         I'll join you shortly.

               She takes the children off toward the elephants.

               Treves watches them go for a moment, then turns and we go 
               with him into the dark freak tent. He pauses to pay admission 
               at a small booth, then disappears within.

               DARKNESS. We hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant.

               Treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of 
               the tent. Off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black 
               cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully 
               into it. The tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. 
               People mill about through the weaving corridors. To Treves' 
               right, he sees a sign reading, "The Deadly Fruit of the 
               Original Sin," over a small, very dark corridor.

               Treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows.

               The corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient 
               the spectator.

               Treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the 
               inner chamber.

               In a roped-off space stands a small stage set at eve-level, 
               with curtains on three sides. On the stage is a bell jar 
               filled with grey-murky fluid lit from behind with casts an 
               eerie glow in the chamber. Suspended in the fluid is the 
               life-sized body of a baby-doll with the attached head of a 
               large snake. At the join of head and body is a blob of 
               unidentifiable organic matter. It is obviously phony, but 
               the effect is still very disquieting. At the bottom of the 
               jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of 
               it. Behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious 
               triptych, portraying Adam on one side, Eve on the other, and 
               the tree flowering over the jar.

               Treves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. He 
               studies the strange object with a critical eye. In the passage 
               we hear movement, and an OLDER GENTLEMAN enters. He seems 
               visibly impressed with "The Deadly Fruit of the Original 
               Sin."

<b>                                     OLDER MAN
</b>                         A wicked birth...

               After a moment, Treves quietly leaves the inner chamber.

               As he pushes his way through the corridor, the noise grows 
               and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds. He exits and hears 
               a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve 
               candles, mounted in a row on a ten-foot stand, are blown out 
               by "THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN." His BARKER steps up and talks 
               to the people.

<b>                                     BARKER
</b>                         Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are 
                         larger than this mammoth blacksmith's 
                         bellows. So great is his power of 
                         exhalation, rivaling even that of 
                         the Great North Wind, that he will 
                         now challenge two grown men to attempt 
                         to hold the bellows shut as he applies 
                         the mighty blast of his herculean 
                         breath! Are there any volunteers?

               A few people raise their hands. The Barker scans the crowd 
               and then points over the heads of the volunteers to TWO MEN 
               toward the back.

<b>                                     BARKER
</b>                         Ah! I see two likely lads! Come 
                         forward! Come forward! Pit your 
                         strength against the Mighty Wind-
                         Man!

               During the above, The Incredible Wind-Man removes his cape, 
               revealing his great barrel chest and pot-belly supported by 
               spindly, white, hairless legs.

               As the Barker sets the "Volunteers," the Wind-Man walks about 
               the small platform, huffing and puffing and blowing on the 
               conch shell.

               The "Volunteers" set, the Wind-Man steps up to the end of 
               the bellows, takes an enormous breath, and twirls his black 
               handlebar moustache as a signal to the Barker.

<b>                                     BARKER
</b>                         Gentlemen... Are you ready?

<b>                                     THE LADS
</b>                         Yes we are... Right... etc.

<b>                                     BARKER
</b>                         Ladies and Gentlemen!... Let the 
                         demonstration begin!!

               The Wind-Man clamps his mouth to the bellows, and with great 
               show begins to exhale, savagely stamping his feet. The Two 
               Lads struggle obviously, and then pretend to be forced apart.

               The Barker triumphantly lifts the Wind-Man's hand. The Wind-
               Man ceases to blow, removes his lips from the bellows and 
               the Two Lads instantly collapse together on the floor.

<b>                                     BARKER

<b>                         INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN!!!
</b>
               The crowd cheers, while the Wind-Man puts the conch shell to 
               his lips and proudly stamps his feet, circling about the Two 
               Lads.

               Amidst this applause, Treves smiles indulgently. He moves 
               on, looking for something genuine.

               TWO BOBBIES move through the crowd, intent upon a certain 
               destination. Treves conveys a casual interest in them.

               Treves moves on to A BEARDED LADY who combs her beard, busily 
               chewing tobacco and spitting into a spittoon.

               Treves continues to work his way through the crowd. Up ahead 
               he sees the Bobbies.

<b>                                     BOBBIES
</b>                         Make way! Make way!

               They round a corner.

<b>                                     WOMAN (V.O.)
</b>                         Oh yes they are, they're yours 
                         alright.

               We hear the laughter of a crowd.

               Treves moves closer to see a FAT LADY seated in a chair on 
               the next platform.

               On each knee she holds a DWARF. They are dressed as babies. 
               A SKELETON MAN stands beside her.

<b>                                     SKELETON MAN
</b>                         I refuse to believe it! I will not 
                         accept it! Those babies are simply 
                         too ugly, they cannot be mine!

               The crowd laughs uproariously.

<b>                                     SKELETON MAN
</b>                         I don't want them! Get rid of them! 
                         I don't want to see them!

<b>                                     FAT LADY
</b>                         Darling, don't be difficult! Let's 
                         take our sweet lovely children on an 
                         outing.

<b>                                     SKELETON MAN
</b>                         We'll take these miserable whelps on 
                         an outing, alright! We'll take them 
                         to the zoo... WHERE THEY WILL STAY!

               From the direction the Bobbies have gone, we hear several 
               screams.

<b>                                     FAT LADY
</b>                              (pausing at the screams)
                         Children save yourselves! Prevail 
                         upon your Pappa!

               The two Dwarves get down from her knees and approach the 
               Skeleton Man. They kneel and tug at his thin legs.

<b>                                     DWARVES
</b>                         Poppa! Poppa! Poppa, please!

               At this point, a FATHER holding his YOUNG SON in his arms 
               passes by Treves.

               The Young Boy clutches his Father's neck in fear, hiding his 
               face.

<b>                                     FATHER
</b>                              (out loud, to no one 
                              in particular)
                         This is too much! They should not 
                         allow it! They should not allow it!

               Treves, very curious now, along with several others, make 
               their way around the corner.

               Before him, Treves sees an agitated crowd staring at something 
               that from his point of view he cannot see. Brushing past him 
               is a WOMAN pulling a small, confused and frightened LITTLE 
               GIRL. Getting closer to the commotion, he sees four BOBBIES 
               standing with a well-dressed alderman, arguing with the OWNER 
               of this particular exhibit.

               A distraught, almost hysterical WOMAN is ineffectually 
               striking the Owner with her fists about his head and 
               shoulders, crying weakly and incoherently.

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         Beast, Beast...

               Treves is just about to see whatever it is that is causing 
               the alarm, when one of the Bobbies says:

<b>                                     BOBBY
</b>                         No! That's right out! Drop the 
                         curtain!

               As the curtain drops, Treves just glimpses baggy trouser 
               cuffs and two horribly deformed, root-like feet. The 
               distraught Woman has been pulled away from the Owner and is 
               sobbing on a Bobby's shoulder.

<b>                                     OWNER
</b>                         You can't do that! I've got my rights!

<b>                                     ALDERMAN
</b>                         I have the authority to close you 
                         down, and I'm doing just that!

               In the crowd, Treves notices a YOUNG BOY staring open-mouthed, 
               blankly at the curtain. Treves pushes through the glut of 
               people to join the Boy and get a better view. The curtain is 
               actually a large canvas.

               On it is a life-sized portrait, crudely painted, of a creature 
               that could only be possible in a nightmare. It is the figure 
               of a man turning into an elephant. The transformation, 
               however, is not complete; there is still more of the man 
               than beast. Palm trees in the background suggest the jungle 
               habitat in which this Perverted object might have once roamed.

               Filled with curiosity, Treves moves toward the curtain.

                         himself.

                         different. This is monstrous, and 
                         ought not to be allowed. These

               The alderman turns and leaves the tent.

               He shakes his head in disgust.

               Now at the canvas, Treves tries to lift the edge to get a 
               peek inside the wagon, but the meaty hand of the Owner clamps 
               down on his wrist.

               The two men look at each other for a solid moment.

               Treves backs away and returns his gaze to the painted canvas.

<b>               OPERATING ROOM - THE LONDON HOSPITAL
</b>
               We see a bellows pumping air into the open grate of a cast 
               iron stove. We hear moaning in the background. The coals 
               flare to a fierce glow. From the mouth of the stove protrude 
               the handles of several cauterizing irons, their heads imbedded 
               in the coals. Up above the irons, Treves stands by a waist-
               high operating table covered with black leather. His face is 
               illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse.

               The room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive overcast sky 
               seen through two windows. There is also a large sink, a 
               cupboard containing dressings, gags, manacles, emetics and 
               other unattractive things, and two hard chairs.

               TWO STUDENTS and two other DOCTORS, MR. FOX and MR. HILL, 
               are present. The two Students are pulling with constant 
               pressure on a rope tied to the patient's leg. Treves and Mr. 
               Fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine accident. 
               There are gear-wheel marks getting progressively deeper as 
               they near a great open gash. Mr. Hill places a cotton mask 
               over the patient's nose and mouth and applies drops of 
               chloroform. The patient struggles, but soon his moans subside 
               and he is unconscious.

                         Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope 
                         please. It's a machine accident. I 
                         expect you'll be seeing a good deal 
                         of this.

               The two medical Students come forward. They stare uneasily 
               at the gaping wound, which bubbles each time the man takes 
               an agonized breath.

               Treves and Fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as Hodges 
               and Pierce look on.

               Treves now notices that the student's faces have gone a trifle 
               ashen.

                         it could stand up by itself in the 
                         corner. I've still got mine

<b>               HALLWAY
</b>
               A hospital MESSENGER BOY, dressed in a blue uniform and a 
               can is making his way down the hall. He stops and looks into 
               an operating room much like the one we have just seen.

               Inside, the room is empty. The Boy closes the door and 
               continues on to another operating room. The Doctors move 
               with great urgency around the operating table. Blood is 
               draining down into a white porcelain bowl. A Woman can be 
               heard moaning. The Boy looks carefully, but finally closes 
               the door and continues on his way.

<b>               TREVES' OPERATING ROOM
</b>
               There is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing of 
               the wound comes up obscuring part of Treves' face. The patient 
               is being held down firmly by the other men.

               The door opens and Treves looks up. The Boy pops his head 
               in.

               AERIAL SHOT from third floor of the London Hospital looking 
               down on the hospital square.

               Below, Treves is walking briskly across the square, through 
               a gate and into the slums beyond.

               The aerial shot is actually FOX'S POV, and now we see Fox 
               filled with curiosity, watching the figure from a window.

               Looking down from above and to the side of him, we follow 
               Treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a 
               recent rain, covered with horse manure and filth of all sorts. 
               The air is smoky from meat burning fires.

               Rounding a corner, we see and approach the painted canvas 
               sign of "The Elephant Man" covering the front of a small, 
               dingy shop. The door of the shop is windowless and padlocked. 
               Treves walks into the picture, studies the whole scene for a 
               moment, goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked.

               Treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas. To his 
               left he sees a SMALL BOY watching him intently.

               He holds a coin out. The Boy nods, snatches the coin and 
               then disappears around the corner.

               Treves turns back to the canvas.

<b>               A PUB
</b>
               A noisy pub, long and narrow. Benches run the length of the 
               back wall, with small tables up against them. Men are 
               clustered around the bar, talking in groups.

               We see the Boy standing at one of the tables talking to the 
               Owner, greedily consuming his lunch as he listens. The Boy 
               gestures outside.

<b>               OUTSIDE THE PUB
</b>
               The Boy comes out the door, quickly followed by the Owner 
               hurriedly putting on his coat, fumbling with a riding crop, 
               the last of his sandwich stuffed in his mouth.

<b>               AT THE CORNER
</b>
               The Boy and the Owner are carefully looking around the corner 
               at Treves still in front of the portrait.

               He snatches the money.

<b>               INSIDE THE SHOP
</b>
               Total darkness. We hear the sound of the padlock being 
               removed. The door opens and light streams in. The canvas 
               covering the windows at the front of the shop obscures all 
               other light. The Owner enters, followed by Treves and the 
               Boy. From his expression, as well as Treves', we can tell 
               there must be an awful stench in the room. No one says a 
               word. The Boy closes the door, while the owner lights a small 
               gas light. We can now see the shop. It it empty, grey with 
               dust, cold and dank. Some old tins and a few shriveled 
               potatoes occupy a shelf. The far end of the shop is blocked 
               off by a curtain suspended from a cord by a few rings.

               The Owner approaches it.

</b>                         Here we are sir.
                              (ticking it off by 
                              rote)
                         Life is full of surprises. Ladies 
                         and gentlemen, consider the fate of 
                         this creature's poor mother. In the 
                         fourth month of her maternal 
                         condition, she was struck down by a 
                         wild elephant
                              (leering)
                         Struck down, if you take my meaning, 
                         on an uncharted African isle. The 
                         result is plain to see ladies and 
                         gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT 
<b>                         MAN!
</b>
               The rings rattle back, and the curtain is omen. We see a 
               bent figure crouching on a stool, covered by a brown blanket. 
               In front of it on a tripod is a large brick, heated from 
               below by a bunsen burner. From the blanket protrudes a 
               perfectly normal left arm and hand warming itself over the 
               brick.

               It does not move when the curtain is drawn.

               Treves steps closer. The Owner, watching his every move, 
               turns-and smiles at him. He bangs his riding crop on the 
               wall and yells to the crouched figure, as if speaking to a 
               dog.

               The Boy, excited by his own fear, mimics the Owner.

</b>                         Stand up!

               The figure comes forward and lets the blanket fall to the 
               ground and we see the ELEPHANT MAN himself.

               Treves, his eyes wide with horror and wonder, his mouth frozen 
               open, steps backward in an instinctive movement of self 
               preservation.

               The Owner laughs.

               The Elephant Man is naked to the waist, his feet are bare 
               and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat man's dress 
               suit. He is a little below average height, and looks shorter 
               from the bowing of his back. His head is enormous and 
               misshapen, as big around as a man's waist. From his brow 
               projects a huge boney mass, almost obscuring his right eye. 
               His nose is a nose of flesh, recognizable only from its 
               position.

               From the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding 
               from the mouth like a stump, turning the upper lip inside 
               out, making a slobbering aperture.

               It almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or 
               tusk. On top of his head is a handful of lank, black hair. 
               At the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin, resembling 
               cauliflower. These loathsome growths cover his back and hang 
               down to the middle of his thighs. The right arm is enormous 
               and shapeless, the hand like a knot of tuberous roots. His 
               left arm is not only normal, but delicately shaped, with 
               fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy. From his 
               chest hangs another bag of flesh, like the dewlap of a lizard.

               His legs are also grossly deformed, his feet great stumps. 
               Behind him, as painted in the portrait, are two crudely 
               constructed palm trees.

               The Owner harshly raps again.

               The Elephant Man begins to turn. The boy filled with malicious 
               glee at seeing the monster obey, screams.

               The Elephant Man completes his turn and comes to rest.

               We see a CLOSE-UP of the Elephant Man looking at Treves. His 
               face is utterly devoid, and incapable, of expression.

               We see the Elephant Man's eyes. He closes them.

               The Owner is locking up.

               Treves, facing the street, drinks in the fresh air. He is 
               trying to forget his shock, put everything into focus.

               He looks at the garish portrait again.

               Treves produces his purse.

               The Owner, smelling money, turns.

               Treves hands him several coins.

               Treves hands the Owner a card. The Owner, greasy and dirty, 
               shakes Treves' hand and squeezes his arm.

                         each other completely.

               The Owner gives Treves the evil look of a conspirator.

               Treves walks off, disoriented.

               The Owner reads the card and smiles at Treves walking away 
               down the street.

<b>               DISSOLVE TO OUTSIDE THE SHOP
</b>
               A CABMAN is knocking on the door of the shop, staring at the 
               portrait. The door opens, revealing a figure in a floor-length 
               black cloak. On his head is an extremely large hat, cut to 
               the lines of a yachting cap. A grey-flannel curtain hangs 
               from the bottom of the cap all the way around, hiding his 
               face.

               There is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes. On the 
               figure's feet are large, bag-like slippers. The only part of 
               the body seen at all is the left arm and hand, which protrudes 
               from the cloak, holding a crude walking stick.

               The figure seems to loathe being in the open. We can just 
               barely see in the darkness within the Owner standing to one 
               side of the door, obviously enjoying the surprise on the 
               Cabman's face. The Owner steps abruptly into his view.

</b>                         Don't just stand there. Help him up.

               The Cabman, does so, while a small, curious crowd forms. The 
               Owner gives the Cabman the card. The Cabman jumps up onto 
               the seat and off they go.

<b>               THE RECEIVING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL
</b>
               The receiving room is a bare hall, painted stone color. It 
               has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are made, 
               and certificates and other papers are issued. It is a cold, 
               harsh place.

               He exits.

               Treves turns and sees the Matron, staring.

                         I'm not to be disturbed.

               She nods silently. Treves looks at the figure for a moment.

               He starts to go out of the room. The hooded figure just stands 
               there, motionless.

               We see the whole room, the people now silent. They all stare 
               at the figure.

               No one makes a move.

<b>                                     MATRON
</b>                         You heard the doctor... Go on.

               Treves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands there a 
               moment, then slowly shuffles after him. Mrs. Mothershead and 
               the people in the room watch him go. When he is out of sight, 
               they all begin to talk excitedly.

               Mothershead stands fixed and watches too, ignoring the noisy 
               room.

<b>               TREVES' OFFICE
</b>
               The door opens and Treves leads the hooded figure to a chair 
               in front of his desk and helps him to sit down, furtively 
               trying to look into the eye-slit of the mask. In the small 
               room the smell of the Elephant Man is overwhelming.

               Treves goes to the window and opens it. He nervously tries 
               to compose himself, then turns to the hooded figure.

                         all right?

               The figure in the chair is still. Treves is at a loss. His 
               sense of discomfort is growing. He looks at the floor for a 
               moment, then locks his eyes on the figure's left arm.

                         be all right?

               The figure does nothing. Treves sits down at his desk and 
               picks up a pencil.

                         for "yes", alright? Do you understand?

               The figure following Treves' movements nods very slowly, 
               "yes". Treves sighs with relief.

               The figure begins to babble incoherently. Treves, alarmed, 
               interrupts.

               Again the figure, following Treves movements, shakes his

               The figure begins to moan. There are two sharp raps at the 
               door. The hooded figure flinches.

               The door opens and Fox pokes his head into the room.

               The figure is hiding in the corner, crouched behind a black 
               frock operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus it 
               stands up by itself.

               Treves looks quickly around the room and finally sees him. 
               He looks at the figure for a moment.

               Treves' voice fades as we DISSOLVE TO the Doctors, who at 
               first were rigid and flustered, and now bent forward, 
               concentrating, obviously consumed with interest.

               Spiraling down again we see Treves finishing his lecture.

               The Elephant Man (hereafter the E.M.) wearing his cloak, is 
               seated by the desk. Treves stands behind him, measuring his 
               head with calipers. He removes the calipers and notes the 
               span, then sets them on the desk. He places the hood over 
               the E.M.'s head. Treves sits at his desk and makes some final 
               notes. He becomes more absorbed in his notes than in the 
               E.M. The E.M. makes an unintelligible sound.

               The E.M. is silent. Treves, only now realizing that the E.M. 
               has said something, looks up at him.

               He exits. The E.M. is alone. He rises and shuffles slowly 
               about, investigating the room. He goes to the desk and begins 
               touching things, including the calipers. He notices the card 
               Treves gave to the Owner tucked in the back pages. He pauses 
               for a moment and then takes the card. His hand disappears 
               into the cloak, and he moves back into the corner behind the 
               stiff, black operating coat.

               Treves re-enters.

               The E.M. takes up his stick and follows Treves out.

<b>               UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THE LONDON HOSPITAL

               We see Treves and Fox alone at a window. They are looking 
               down on the hospital square Treves had previously crossed 
               and see the E.M., lit by gaslight and moving to a waiting 
               cab.

                         I pray God he's an idiot.

               The E.M., as he is getting into the cab, stops, turns and 
               looks to the upper stories of the hospital. Treves and Fox 
               are joined by three laughing colleagues who clap Treves on 
               the back.

<b>               ENTRY HALL - TREVES' HOME

               We see a door. It opens and Treves walks in. He shuts the 
               door, locks it, goes to a coat rack on the wall and hangs up 
               his overcoat and hat. He notices his reflection in a mirror 
               and examines himself wearily. Anne's smiling reflection 
               appears beside his.

               We move past Anne's reflection to a CU of Treves.

<b>               WHITECHAPEL - NIGHT
</b>
               We now see a bunsen burner roar of flame reflected in Bytes' 
               eyes. Pulling back we see Bytes, quite drunk, sitting, cooking 
               sausages over the hot brick.

               He takes another drink from his gin bottle. Up comes a wet 
               belch and he takes another drink.

               The E.M. is crouched against the wall with a bowl of potatoes 
               and a cup of water in front of him. With his good hand, he 
               is picking tiny pieces of potato and feeding himself. The 
               eating is fairly loud and animal-like. The drinking is even 
               worse.

               The Boy is across the room asleep, wrapped in ragged little 
               blankets.

               The E.M. takes a drink of water, making a loud smacking, 
               slurping sound.

               Bytes looks up from his cooking with a smoldering look, just 
               waiting for him to make the sound again. He does and Bytes 
               takes his crop and violently jabs him.

                         How can I eat with that?

               Bytes takes a mouthful of gin and mockingly slurps it 
               mimicking the E.M.'s sound.

                         How can I eat with THAT?

               The E.M. picks and eats some more and then drinks again very 
               tentatively.

               Because of his fear the water catches in his throat and he 
               spits and coughs out onto the floor, gasping and wheezing 
               for breath.

               Bytes is up and whacks him with his riding crop.

               The E.M. struggles to get up, carrying his food.

               He jabs the E.M. again, spilling his potatoes and water onto 
               the floor.

               He pushes the E.M. again, then slips on the potatoes and 
               falls heavily to the floor, crying out in shock. Then rage 
               hits him. The E.M. backs up.

               The Boy wakes up in fear. Bytes moves quickly toward the 
               E.M. raising his crop. The E.M. stumbles and falls backward 
               onto the floor. His head goes back and he begins gasping for 
               air. Bytes yanks him up and hits him in the face with his 
               riding crop. The force of the blow knocks a glob of spit 
               into the air from the E.M.'s mouth. The E.M. gasps and wheezes 
               horribly as Bytes hits him again and again.

               From across the room.

               His head bent forward toward his knees. Bytes is going to

               bruises and bloody cuts. Treves freezes at the sight and 
               slowly turns to look at Bytes.

               She leans out the door for another look, but the hall is 
               empty. A Nurse ladles mush into bowls.

               There is a lot of activity in the kitchen. Nora takes the

               "Isolation".

               Carr Gomm is leaning out the door to his office, unseen by

               There is one tiny barred window located high up on the far

               hanging from a peg on the wall beside him. He is still 
               wheezing and appears to be very weak. Treves serves the 
               mixture to the E.M., who sputters and gags on it, but manages 
               to get it down. Treves goes to the table and puts the two

               The E.M. makes a garbled sound.

               Treves, alone with the E.M., once more finds himself becoming 
               uncomfortable.

                         sure you must be simply famished.

                         everything you need, and, uh... yes.

               Treves puts out a comforting hand to the E.M. who flinches 
               back. The two men just look at each other.

               Merrick looks up to Mothershead, then averts his eyes. He 
               looks back at her and sees she has no difficulty being in 
               his presence.

               At the door of Merrick's attic room stand two buckets of 
               very dirty water. We hear footsteps coming up stairs and see 
               a young porter carrying two buckets of clean, steaming water. 
               He puts them down, knocks on the door, and takes the dirty 
               water downstairs. The door opens, Mrs. Mothershead picks up 
               the steaming buckets and takes them inside, shutting the 
               door.

               Merrick's seated in a tin bathtub trying to hide his 
               nakedness. Mrs. Mothershead pours the water in. She scrubs 
               his back with obvious distaste, but does her job. Months of 
               filth and accumulated excrescence are turning the bath water 
               a murky black. As Mothershead scrubs, Merrick slowly leans 
               forward in the bath, closing his eyes, apparently oblivious 
               to his surroundings.

               Treves sits beside him.

               Merrick flinches and pulls away.

                         foolishness.

               Treves leans forward and looks at Merrick. Merrick grows 
               still, his eyes closed, apparently in a reverie.

                         the disease as a child, he was 
                         abandoned. But in that case, he'd 
                         have to have had care. The very fact 
                         that he's alive bears that out...

                         But, where?

               Merrick is listening.

               At this word, Merrick begins to babble wildly. Obviously 
               alarmed, he thrashes about in the tub, spilling water onto 
               the floor. Treves, alarmed now himself, attempts to calm 
               Merrick, who, still babbling, tries to rise from the tub.

               Mothershead clamps a hand on Merrick's left arm. At her touch, 
               he is instantly subdued, at least physically. He sinks back 
               into the tub and begins to weep. Treves and Mothershead are 
               astounded by the tears rolling down Merrick's cheeks. They 
               stand motionless looking down at the agonized, naked elephant 
               man.

               The young PORTER is exiting with great difficulty through a 
               large iron door carrying the two buckets. He sets one of the 
               buckets down, takes the other and splashes it out into the 
               alley. Some thick sludge dribbles from the empty bucket. 
               Unseen by him, the NIGHT PORTER is standing just to the side 
               and he now comes forward. The young Porter seems nervous in 
               his presence.

               The Night Porter looks at his spattered shoes, then up to 
               the Young Porter.

               Suddenly the Night Porter kicks the other bucket of filthy 
               water violently, sending it splashing all over the young 
               Porter.

               boots. He appears and walks into a darkened women's ward. 
               The women are all asleep. Some coughing fitfully, others 
               moaning quietly. The Night Porter walks down the aisle between 
               the beds. We see several of the sleeping women as he passes 
               them. Finally, he comes to a young beautiful woman, her eyes 
               wide open, watching him with intense fear. On either side of 
               her are two very ancient women, snoring deeply. The young 
               woman has her arms tied, suspended in traction above her. 
               The Night Porter moves to her, his shadow engulfing her.

               She starts to move, rattling the apparatus above her. The 
               Porter puts a finger to his lips.

               Somewhere a door is opened and the squeak sounds vaguely 
               like the trumpeting of an elephant. We hear again the metallic 
               footfalls of the Night Porter's boots, and he appears. He 
               goes to the narrow stairway marked, "Isolation".

               He stops and casually looks about. He takes a swig of his

               Merrick as before the light is very dim. We hear the echoing 
               footfalls of the Night Porter coming up the stairs. Merrick's 
               head immediately comes up from his knees. As it does, a small 
               object falls from where his head rested.

               He picks it up and puts it in a pocket of his cloak. it is 
               the portrait of the beautiful woman, which he saw in his 
               dream.

               Suddenly the door swings open and the Night Porter, bottle 
               in hand, is standing there. He walks into the room and sees 
               Merrick's shape on the bed.

               Merrick is trembling. The Night Porter, hardly able to believe 
               his eyes, moves slowly toward Merrick. He is afraid but as 
               he reaches the bed, Merrick flinches back. The Night Porter 
               grins, his fear gone now. He is in control.

               He tentatively presses the bottom of the bottle up against 
               the hanging growth on Merrick's chest. Encouraged, he touches 
               him with his fingers. Merrick makes a small whimpering sound.

               He moves to the door and turns.

               He moves out the door and it closes. In the bed, Merrick 
               looks at the door with terror as the heavy footfalls of the 
               Night Porter recede down the stairs.

               We see a horse's head in CU, snorting steam into the chill 
               morning air. The horse is harnessed to a milk wagon parked 
               in front of the London. Through the open back of the wagon 
               we see the MILKMAN, and past him Treves, walking towards us.

                         you don't mind my saying so, sir, 
                         with your early habits, you'd 'a 
                         made a fine milkman.

                         that in mind!

               Treves walks up the path into the hospital.

<b>               HALLWAY (MORNING)
</b>
               Treves, carrying a bowl, crosses the upper hall and starts 
               to the narrow stairway to the Isolation Ward. Over his 
               shoulder we see him knock twice on the door. As the door 
               swings open, the camera pushes past him and we see the room. 
               The lamp is still burning, but Merrick is nowhere to be seen. 
               Treves enters, looking about for him.

               There's movement in the corner beside the bed. Merrick rises 
               slightly from the shadow. The light from the lamp hits his 
               frightened eyes.

                         your breakfast.

               Treves is unsettled by the sight of Merrick cowering down on 
               the floor.

               Merrick begins to babble. Treves enters the room, placing 
               the bowl on the table and going to Merrick.

                         cold floor is bad for you. I won't 
                         hurt you, come on now...

               He helps Merrick up onto the bed and goes back to the table 
               for the bowl.

                         strength...

               He has turned back to the bed, but Merrick has slipped to 
               the floor again, still trying to hide himself in the corner.

                         you?

               He puts the bowl down again and goes back to Merrick, who 
               seems very upset at leaving his hiding place.

               He starts to help Merrick up, but Merrick just presses himself 
               farther back in the corner, still babbling. There are two 
               raps at the door. Treves goes to it and lets Mothershead in.

</b>                         Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be 
                         his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?

</b>                         Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. 
                         There seems to be some difficulty 
                         this morning.

               They both look at the bed. Merrick has almost disappeared 
               under it.

</b>                         Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle 
                         it.

               She goes to Merrick and takes hold of his left wrist.

<b>                                     MOTHERSHEAD
</b>                         Alright, my son, none of this fuss. 
                         Come up from there, this instant.

               She starts to force him up from the floor. Merrick is moaning 
               now, still trying to get away.

<b>                                     TREVES
</b>                         No! Don't pull at him like that. We 
                         don't want to frighten him more than 
                         he already is.

               By this time Mothershead has almost got him back on the bed.

<b>                                     MOTHERSHEAD
</b>                         Honestly, sir, you must be very firm 
                         with this sort. Otherwise they'd lay 
                         about on the floor gibbering all day 
                         long. All he understands is a good 
                         smack.

               They help Merrick settle back on the pillow. Merrick is still 
               making desperate, unintelligible sounds.

                         drives him under the bed. We must 
                         use patience and understanding with 
                         this man.

</b>                         Perhaps you've got the time for that, 
                         Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've 
                         got an entire hospital to look after, 
                         and you have your real patients. 
                         Don't waste your time with him sir, 
                         it's like talking to a wall. I don't 
                         mean to be harsh, but truthfully 
                         what can you do for him? I'll be 
                         back later for his bath. And Mr. 
                         Carr Gomm would like to see you when 
                         you have a moment. Good day sir.

               She exits. Treves shuts the door behind her and turns back 
               to the bed.

                         What good am I to you...?

               He goes to the bed and sits down in front of Merrick, angered 
               by his own seeming uselessness in the situation.

                         want to help you, I want to be your

                              (directly to Merrick)
                         but I can't help you unless you help 
                         me, unless I know what you are

                         back there, there's something you 
                         want to say, but I've got to 
                         understand you. Do you understand 
                         me?

               Merrick hesitates, then starts babbling again.

                         understand me!

               Slowly Merrick nods yes.

                         to hear how you say things. Now, 
                         very slowly, say "yes."

               Treves carefully mouths the word.

</b>                         "Yes."

               Merrick is still hesitant, from years of fear, but his eyes 
               betray a growing excitement. Slowly, he tries to talk, his 
               voice a tremulous whisper.

                              arm)
                         Yes John!

               Throughout their dialogue, Merrick is still very garbled, 
               but he no longer babbles. He makes a great effort to speak 
               slowly, to form words the way Treves forms them, to be 
               understood.

               Mrs. Mothershead comes out of the kitchen with a supper tray 
               and walks down the hall, passing the open ward door. We see 
               nurses serving patients their supper. Nora comes out of the

                         you're having to do extra work on my

                         that's alright, Ireland. This one's

                         Mothershead. He listens and repeats 
                         with great attention, and this

                         It's all very nice, but I don't see 
                         the point. You know they won't let

                         I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a 
                         good impression on the hospital 
                         committee they'd see that he's the 
                         exception to their rule. Now I'm not 
                         expecting miracles. I'm not saying 
                         he'll be able to read or write, but 
                         I do think that I can get him to 
                         speak for himself. I'm going to 
                         arrange things with Carr Gomm right 
                         now.
                              (to Merrick)
                         That was very good, John, very good. 
                         That's all for today. We shall do 
                         some more tomorrow. Mothershead?

               Mrs. Mothershead sets the tray down beside Merrick.

               He and Mothershead exit. Merrick watches the door close. He 
               sighs quietly, looks about, and sees the Bible on the bedside 
               table. He picks it up and, gently runs his fingers over the 
               cover.

<b>               RECEIVING ROOM - THE LONDON
</b>
               There is total pandemonium in the receiving room. The room 
               is filled with screaming men, women and children. Two drunken 
               women have been fighting with broken bottles and are now 
               covered with blood and cuts. The women are still hysterical, 
               one minute they're sobbing, then in an instant screaming and 
               intent upon fighting again. The crowd keeps them apart. Two 
               Bobbies stand in the background making no move to intercede.

               To the side we see Bytes watching everything. It is still 
               too violent a scene for the Nurses to come to the women's 
               aide and they stand up in the front of the room waiting. 
               Bytes makes his way along the side of the crowd waiting for 
               a chance to get behind the Nurses and on into the hospital. 
               Now the women begin sobbing again and things quiet some. The 
               Nurses come forward into the crowd. Bytes moves over closer 
               to the hallways. When the Nurses have all gone into the crowd 
               he seizes the chance and disappears into the hospital.

                         the hospital committee, then they

                         nature of the disease, but of the 
                         man as well. If the committee had a 
                         chance to speak with him, hear him 
                         say a few words for himself, I'm 
                         sure they would see him as a patient, 
                         rather than as a violation of the 
                         rules.

                         decision on the merits of the case,

               Merrick is propped up in bed. Suddenly the door bursts open. 
               The Night Porter, an arm around a drunken giggling tart, 
               stands in the doorway. As soon as the Charwoman sees Merrick, 
               she screams as does Merrick, and she wriggles free, making 
               for the stairs. The Night Porter watches her go and then 
               turns to Merrick laughing noisily. He then pulls the door 
               shut with a bang.

               Merrick, very frightened, crawls down into his hiding place.

               Merrick is standing beside his disguise on its hook. He 
               nervously smooths the cloak down, repositions the Bible on 
               the bedside table and smooths the cloak again. He looks at 
               the door, expecting it to open. It doesn't. His hands smooths 
               the cloak over and over again. Voices can be heard outside 
               the door.

               Merrick freezes.

               There are two raps at the door. Merrick flinches, clutching 
               the cloak. The raps are repeated. He pulls himself together 
               and walks to the middle of the room. He takes a deep breath 
               and closes his eyes.

               The door opens and Treves and Carr Gomm enter. Carr Gomm's 
               eyes are rivited on Merrick, but he contains his shock.

               Merrick is breathing unevenly, his eyes still closed. Treves 
               goes to him and touches his shoulder. Merrick opens his eyes 
               and looks up at Treves. Treves turns to Carr Gomm, as does 
               Merrick. Carr Gomm lowers his eyes.

               Before Carr Gomm can withdraw his hand, Merrick grasps it 
               with his left hand.

               There is an uncomfortable silence. Merrick releases it. Carr 
               Gomn, nervously clears his throat.

               Merrick looks at Treves for guidance, but Treves cannot look

               Treves and Carr Gomm go out the door onto the landing. Merrick 
               sees his chance escaping him and tries to recapture their 
               attention.

                              strength)
                         The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not

                              (he continues through 
                              the following dialogue)

               Treves and Carr Gomm are alone on the landing, speaking 
               quietly.

                         man is so obviously mouthing your 
                         words.

                         your time, sir. I just felt that I 
                         had to do anything I could to protect 
                         him.

                         belong here. He's be much happier 
                         somewhere else, where he could be 
                         constantly looked after. Believe me, 
                         Frederick, it's better that it worked 
                         out this way. Good day.

               Merrick has come to the end of what Treves taught him to 
               say. He makes one last, desperate attempt to be heard.

               Treves, disheartened, stands on the landing as Carr Gomm 
               starts down the stairs.

               Gomm looks up at him.

               Treves comes in, shuts the door and leans against it. They 
               look at each other for a moment.

               Merrick is in bed, very tired. It's been an exhausting day. 
               Suddenly the door opens and Mothershead comes into the room. 
               Merrick looks up at her very apprehensively. She walks over 
               to the bed, picks up the Bible from the table, opens it and 
               hands it to Merrick.

               Mothershead backs slowly to the door, deeply disturbed. She 
               stares at Merrick for a moment.

               As before the lights are going off in one hallway after 
               another. The hallways are empty, dark and silent. We hear 
               the great iron door close with a bang.

               Merrick is in his bed as always. He holds the portrait of 
               the beautiful woman, gazing at it longingly. He hears a door 
               close far away in the silence of the hospital.

               Suddenly we hear the heavy footfalls of the Night Porter's 
               boots. As they get louder and louder we move slowly closer 
               to Merrick's face.

               The sound is very close now, and Merrick's eyes are visibly 
               agitated.

               Finally, the door bursts open and the Night Porter is standing 
               there. He stares malevolently at Merrick for a long moment 
               and then walks to him menacingly.

               He grabs Merrick fiercely by the hair and jerks his head 
               back. Merrick immediately starts to wheeze and gasp.

               is prone, struggling for breath.

               The Night Porter is as first surprised, and then pleased at 
               the desperate sound.

               Satisfied, the Night Porter rights Merrick who is just able 
               to catch his breath. The Night Porter smiles and pats Merrick 
               on the shoulder.

               Treves and Carr Gomm are on their way to the committee

                         Both the Royal Hospital and the

                         even if sufficient funds for his 
                         care were provided. The workhouse is 
                         certainly out of the question. The

</b>                         Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion. 
                         There are two small rooms off Bedstead 
                         Square that are no longer in use and 
                         would be admirably suited to Mr. 
                         Merrick's needs. I also propose to 
                         write a letter to The Times, appealing 
                         to their readers for assistance. 
                         Knowing the generosity of the British 
                         public, I feel we would have little 
                         trouble in raising the funds for his 
                         maintenance. Indeed, this hospital's 
                         rules do preclude the admission of 
                         incurables, but if ever there was an 
                         exception to the rule, it is this 
                         patient. So therefore, I propose, if 
                         Mr. Treves is finished, that we put 
                         it to a vote. All those in favor of 
                         keeping Mr. Merrick here?

               Carr Gomm and another committee member raise their hands. 
               Broadneck is displeased.

                         has no business being in our hospital. 
                         I think Mr. Carr Gomm's letter would 
                         be an excellent idea,
                              (to Carr Gomm)
                         and when you appeal for funds, I 
                         think you should appeal for a more 
                         appropriate place for him as well. I 
                         agree the British public is generous, 
                         and I'm sure that somewhere the 
                         creature will find a happy and 
                         permanent home, but not here.

                         the Isolation Ward for more deserving

               The room is elegantly furnished and heavily carpeted. The 
               walls are panelled in richly gleaming walnut with finely 
               wrought brass lamps spaced regularly along their length. In 
               the center of the room is a long oak table with a fine linen 
               table cloth, around which sits a number of Doctors, among 
               them, Fox.

               Some of them are still eating. A waiter is clearing away a 
               few plates and several Doctors are helping themselves to 
               port wine kept in decanters in the center of the table and 
               to cigars in humidors. One of them is reading The Times. At 
               one end of the table sits Treves, picking at his food.

               We see a small, very dusty, dirty room, filled with boxes 
               and bedsteads and other things stored over the years. The 
               one grimy window is locked shut.

               The door opens and two middle-aged CHARWOMEN enter. They 
               look around at the room with distaste and drop their mops 
               and buckets.

               The 1st Woman, laughing, takes another healthy swig from the

               silhouette of the main spire of St. Philip's Cathedral against 
               the sky.

               It fills the screen.

               Merrick sitting on his bed, hunched over in concentration 
               reading an Illustrated London News. He is staring at a picture 
               of the Eddystone Lighthouse.

               He looks at the picture silently. There is a knock at the 
               door. Merrick says, "Come in". Treves enters, holding a book.

                         it, it's very popular.

               He holds the book out to him. It's an "Alice In Wonderland".

               He lovingly feels the leather binding and looks at Treves 
               with speechless gratitude.

               Merrick carefully opens the book to a colored frontpiece, 
               the picture of Alice grown too large for a hallway, looking 
               imploringly at the dwarfed White Rabbit. The caption reads 
               "...curiouser and curiouser". He leafs through the pages 
               looking at the other illustrations as Treves, delighted with 
               the gift's effect, looks on.

                         Good night.

               Treves' words have disturbed Merrick. He sinks into the 
               pillows, the book before him. We see the picture of the Mock 
               Turtle perched upon his rock, great tears rolling down his 
               cow-like face, as Alice and the Gryphon look on with intense 
               sympathy. Merrick looks up at his disguise hanging on the

               boys who, having heard the Night Porter's words, slips 
               unnoticed from the pub.

               Merrick, in his disguise, and Treves, one arm around him, 
               are walking together. Merrick seems very uneasy.

               A Nurse, on duty early or late getting off, passes them. She 
               stares at the hooded figure. They continue on in silence.

               The room is now spotless. It is furnished with a bed and the 
               required pillows, a small table and chair by the window, now 
               curtained. Adjoining this room is a smaller one which contains 
               a bathtub.

               Merrick enters and looks around, confused. Treves stands in 
               the doorway.

                         the inside of that horrible place 
                         again. You will never, ever go back 
                         to the workhouse... or that man. 
                         It's a splendid room, don't you think?

               Merrick inspects his new home. He seems pleased-by the 
               bathtub, by the table, by the window to the outside world.

               Merrick pulls the curtain aside and opens the window. He 
               looks out and then up with a small intake of breath. Before 
               him, beyond the hospital fence, the spire of St. Phillips 
               Cathedral stands resplendently in the morning light.

               Carr Gomm goes back into his office and Treves walks off.

<b>               MERRICK'S ROOM (A WHILE LATER)
</b>
               There is no one in the room. The bathroom door opens and 
               Nora and another nurse enter, carrying buckets which they 
               set down by the hall door. They straighten up and lean back 
               against it.

               Mrs. Mothershead enters from the bathroom, speaking over her 
               shoulder to Merrick.

                         duties over to you girls now. Mr. 
                         Merrick will require a bath every 
                         day... that way he won't pong quite 
                         so much. Nora, you can instruct 
                         Kathleen on the finer points of Mr. 
                         Merrick's bath. You'll be on your 
                         own tomorrow.

               The girls try to keep bright faces.

                         more cheerful.

               Mothershead starts to exit.

                         are there to be any mirrors brought 
                         into this room.

               She exits.

                         me.

               Merrick quietly enters the room, dressed in a billowy white 
               shirt and baggy black pants. The two nurses try to smile, 
               but he cannot look at them.

               Kathleen's eyes go wide at the sound.

               Merrick looks down at himself.

</b>                         No, nothing.

               The girls leave, taking the buckets.

               Merrick, alone, walks about the room getting the feel of his 
               new clothes.

               There is a knock at the door and Treves enters.

</b>
<b>               ENTRY HALL AND SITTING ROOM - TREVES' HOME
</b>
               The door opens. Merrick, disguised, enters, followed by Treves 
               who closes it and hangs up Merrick's mask on the coat rack. 
               The mirror has been removed, leaving a faint outline on the 
               wall.

               Merrick is enchanted by the house. Treves takes him by the 
               arm and leads him into the sitting room. Anne appears at the 
               top of the stairs.

</b>                         Make yourself comfortable, John.

               Treves comes back to the foot of the stairs and smiles up at 
               Anne.

</b>                         Come and meet our quest, my love.

               Anne manages a smile, comes down the stairs and together 
               they go into the sitting room.

               Merrick is examining everything in the room. Nothing in this 
               almost magical world escapes his attention. The furniture, 
               the personal mementoes, particularly the pictures on the 
               fireplace. He turns around when he hears them enter, lowering 
               his eyes.

                         my wife, Anne Treves.

               Anne is startled, but conceals it very well.

               Anne extends her hand. John takes her hand and looks up very 
               slowly meeting her eyes. Anne smiles.

<b>                                     MERRICK
</b>                         I'm very...

               Then, Merrick bursts into tears. Anne is at a loss as to 
               what to do. Merrick takes his hand from hers and covers his 
               eyes, weeping pitiously. Treves puts his hand on Merrick's 
               shoulder.

               Treves and Anne exchange worried looks.

               Merrick cannot answer through his sobs.

               Anne is composing herself by busily fixing the tea and cakes. 
               She stops for a moment, takes a breath, and then resumes her 
               activity.

               Treves and Merrick coming down the stairs. Merrick is calm 
               now. They go into the sitting room, where Anne is just setting 
               the tea tray out. Treves ushers Merrick to a highbacked sofa 
               and sits him down. Merrick is very shy of Anne.

               Treves and Anne sit on the other side of the table.

                         Mrs. Treves sometimes says that the 
                         only room she can call her own is 
                         the bedroom.

               Treves and Anne laugh good-naturedly. Merrick's face, as 
               always, is quite blank.

               Merrick sets the picture down carefully.

               He reaches into his cloak and brings out the small portrait 
               of the beautiful woman. Treves is absolutely amazed. Merrick 
               gently hands the picture to Anne.

</b>                         She has the face of an angel... She 
                         was an angel. She was so kind... so 
                         kind to me. It's not her fault, for 
                         in the fourth month of her maternal 
                         condition she was knocked down by an 
                         elephant. I'm sure I must have been 
                         a great disappointment to her.

                         Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as 
                         loving as you are could ever be a 
                         disappointment.

</b>                         If only I could find her. If only 
                         she could see me now, here, with 
                         such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. 
                         Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then 
                         maybe she would love me as I am. 
                         I've tried to hard to be good.

               At this, Anne is so extremely touched that she begins to 
               cry. She tries to hold it in, but to no avail. She reaches a 
               hand out to Merrick and he takes it. He tries to comfort 
               her.

</b>                         Please... please...

               But Anne goes on, as Treves, in wonder, watches her and 
               Merrick locked together in the communication of intense 
               sympathy.

<b>               REAR ENTRANCE - THE LONDON
</b>
               Merrick, in the dimly lit rear hall, is huddled over a trash 
               can tucked underneath a stairway. He pulls out a discarded 
               drug box. He holds it closely to his chest and goes into his 
               room.

<b>               MERRICK'S ROOM
</b>
               Merrick goes to his table and puts the box down. He hangs up 
               his disguise, then goes back to the window and pulls the 
               curtains aside. Moonlight bathes the table, illuminating the 
               portrait of his Mother. John seats himself and sets the box 
               in front of him. He reaches for a pencil, and then begins to 
               draw windows on the front of the box.

<b>               OUTSIDE MERRICK'S ROOM (MORNING)
</b>
               Nora is coming down the hall with a breakfast tray. She stops 
               at Merrick's door and raises a hand to knock.

<b>               MERRICK'S ROOM
</b>
               Merrick, as before, is hunched over the table, pencil in 
               hand. The sides of the box are covered with carefully drawn 
               windows and archways.

               There is a knock at the door and Merrick, startled, looks 
               up. Nora enters and puts the tray on the table. She glances 
               at the box.

<b>                                     NORA

</b>                         Good morning.

               She turns and walks to the cabinet for linen and bath 
               supplies. She opens it and takes out a clean towel and a 
               blanket. She pauses, and turns to look back at the table.

               Merrick is concentrated on his work. Nora, curious now, walks 
               to the table.

               Merrick, conscious of her presence, leans back in his chair 
               and looks up at her.

<b>                                     NORA

               Merrick is silent.

</b>                              (pointing at the box)
                         What is it?

               Merrick points through the window.

<b>                                     NORA
</b>                         What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. 
                         Oh, of course. Why... why that's

               Merrick points out toward the hallway.

<b>                                     NORA
</b>                         The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!

</b>                         I meant no harm, it was the only 
                         place where I could find cardboard. 
                         I thought it has been thrown away.

</b>                         It's alright, it was thrown away. No 
                         one wants it. It's just that it's a 
                         little dirty, that's all.

               She sets the towel and blanket down as she leans closer to 
               inspect the box.

               She points to a circle drawn on top.

<b>                                     NORA

                         Merrick, where did you learn to do 
                         this?

</b>                         ...I learned a long time ago.

               Nora looks at the box.

<b>                                     NORA
</b>                         Oh, but how will you finish it? You 
                         haven't any more cardboard.

               Merrick, at a loss, shrugs his shoulders. The movement makes 
               Nora aware of his body, and he is the Elephant Man once again.

<b>                                     MERRICK
</b>                         I'll have to find some more.

</b>                              (uncomfortably)
                         Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.

               She quickly exits. Merrick watches her go and then turns 
               back to his work.

               He sees the towel and the blanket. He turns quickly to call 
               after Nora, but stops himself. Merrick takes up the towel 
               and blanket, walks into the bathroom, and carefully drapes 
               the towel over the back of the bath.

<b>               MERRICK'S ROOM
</b>
               Merrick is at his table working on his cathedral. There is a 
               knock at the door.

<b>                                     MERRICK

               Treves enters.

                         alright?

               Merrick is a trifle apprehensive, but he agrees. Treves ushers 
               MRS. KENDAL through the door. At the sight of her, Merrick's 
               eyes go wide.

               She-hands Merrick a nicely framed picture of herself. Merrick 
               is speechless, overjoyed by the gift.

                         about giving my pictures to just

                         so beautiful. You are so... I'll 
                         give it a place of honor, here, next 
                         to my mother.

               He places it, with great care, next to his mother's portrait.

               Treves smiles at them.

               Merrick is a trifle nervous but Mrs. Kendal smiles at him 
               and he relaxes a little.

</b>                         It's very difficult to put into a 
                         nutshell, but I should say the theater 
                         is the shrine of the imagination, 
                         where one may suspend disbelief and

                         time you desire. You may look over

               She produces a beautiful leather-bound volume of Shakespeare's 
               works. Merrick takes it with reverence and begins to leaf 
               through it.

               Merrick finds a place and begins to read.

                         "If I profane with my unworthiest 
                         hand, This holy shrine, the gentle

                         that rough touch with a tender kiss."

               Merrick, embarrassed by these last words, starts to close 
               the book.

               Mrs. Kendal knows Juliet's lines by heart. She looks at 
               Merrick for a moment, then replies tenderly.

<b>               THE PEACOCK - WHITECHAPEL
</b>
               People are happily drinking and singing and laughing. Bytes 
               and the boy are keeping a watchful eye on the Night Porter, 
               who is making a deal with a couple of men at a table. They 
               hand over a few coins and follow the Night Porter out of the 
               pub. Bytes finishes his beer and thumps the glass down on 
               the bar. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve and he and the 
               boy casually follow the other three men out.

               Bytes and the boy stand by the pub door, watching the men 
               cross the street and go to the back gate of the hospital 
               which the Night Porter unlocks, and leaves unlocked, but 
               closed, behind them. They walk into Bedstead Square, laughing 
               quietly.

               Bytes crosses the street and goes to the gate. He walks along 
               the iron fence and watches the Night Porter and his 
               "customers". He stops and waits to see where they go.

               The Night Porter stands the two men before a window and 
               motions for them to wait. He goes through a door into the 
               hospital. After a few moments the window opens wide, and 
               there, neatly framed and silhouetted, stand Merrick and the 
               Night Porter, gripping Merrick's neck. The two men outside 
               start back in shock, but stand mesmerized by what they see. 
               We hear the laughter of the Night Porter echo across the 
               empty square.

               Bytes smiles broadly and says softly to himself.

               We see a small circle of women having tea and gossip. One of 
               their daughters, off to the side, is reading a newspaper

                         of fashion and form, was seen leaving 
                         The London the other afternoon. No, 
                         dear readers, the most facile actress 
                         of our day has not been taken ill, 
                         but rather said she was 'visiting a 
                         friend'. And who was the lucky 
                         recipient of this attention? Quick 
                         enquiries proved it to be none other 
                         than Mr. John Merrick, The Elephant 
                         Man, with whom our readers are 
                         undoubtedly familiar. After a chat 
                         of three-quarters of an hour, Mrs. 
                         Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. 
                         Merrick with an autographed portrait 
                         of herself. Owing to a disfigurement 
                         of the most extreme nature, Mr. 
                         Merrick has never been properly 
                         presented to London society. But 
                         knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal 
                         goes, others inevitably follow, the 
                         questions arises: Will London society 
                         present itself to him?"

               A carriage draws up in the street outside the hospital. A 
               nicely dressed woman sticks her head out the window, looks 
               around and scowls disappointedly.

               Nearby is parked another carriage and driver.

                         I can't be seen in this.

               They drive off.

               Above Merrick's bookshelf we see a row of framed pictures of 
               prettily smiling society women. Mrs. Kendal has started a 
               fad. We pan slowly by them and down to Merrick's table where 
               his Mother and Mrs. Kendal have their place of honor. The 
               cathedral is also there. Beside it is a modest tea service.

               We now see a GENTLEMAN standing behind a seated LADY. They 
               hold teacups.

               They are both very attractive and empty-headed, and seem on 
               the verge of screaming. They smile at Merrick who has been 
               talking the whole while.

               Merrick holds an elegant, silvertipped walking stick across 
               his lap, and admires a ring that only fits his little finger.

                         my old one. More tea?

               The Lady and Gentleman nod nervously. John takes the teapot 
               from the service and refills their cups. The Lady's hand 
               shakes, rattling the cup against the saucer.

               him.

               We pan across Merrick's bookcase, now quite full, and we see 
               a few titles: "Moll Flanders", "Emma', "Jane Eyre", "Pamela", 
               and then to Merrick. He and Treves are reading poetry 
               together.

               Merrick closes his book and sits silently for a moment.

                         been meaning to ask you for some 
                         time...

               Treves is taken aback. He considers, then says tentatively.

</b>                         I thought as much.

               Merrick rises. Treves ponders over what Merrick has just 
               said. He looks at Merrick and something very odd happens. 
               Merrick is looking levelly at him.

               For the first and only time, we see expression on his face. 
               It is a calm, knowing look, almost a benign smile. At that 
               very moment there is a bright flash of light behind Merrick's 
               head, seemingly from the window. Treves blinks, unable to 
               comprehend what has just happened. When he looks again, the 
               moment has passed. Merrick, his back to Treves, moves to the 
               bookcase to replace the volume.

               Nora enters with a brown paper parcel tied with string. 
               Merrick says nothing.

                         I have something for you.

               She puts the parcel on the table and opens it. We see several 
               squares of new cardboard, a cutting knife, a pastepot, and a 
               few brushes and some paint.

                         helpful with your cathedral.

               Merrick examines the materials with reverence, and thanks 
               her profusely.

               Treves is moved and a little disconcerted. Merrick lays the 
               things aside carefully and begins to pull the crude spires 
               from the discarded box. Nora smiles at the busy Merrick and 
               exits.

                         How kind of her!

               Treves notices to his dismay that the growths on Merrick's 
               head are larger.

               He finds it very difficult to disguise his concern.

               Merrick is silent. He goes over to his cloak, reaches into 
               it and pulls out a folded up advertisement. He hands it to 
               Treves, who examines it closely. It is an advertisement for 
               an-elegant gentleman's dressing bag, boasting ivory brushes, 
               silver fittings and Moroccan silk lining.

               something large and black. He approaches the furnace and 
               opens the door.

               The man is Treves. He is holding the stiff black surgeon's 
               coat of which he was once so proud. He looks at it for a 
               moment, and then stuffs it into the furnace. Inside, the 
               coat starts to smoke heavily, then bursts into flames.

               Mothershead is standing by the desk looking through a small 
               stack of mail.

               We see in a pair of hands holding a buff colored envelope 
               embossed with the Royal Seal. We follow the hands down the 
               hall to a door where one of the hands knocks next to the 
               "F.C. Carr Gomm" sign, then enters the office.

</b>
               Carr Gomm and Mothershead look up to see a porter with the 
               buff envelope enter. Carr Gomm takes the letter and the porter 
               exits. Carr Gomm opens the letter and reads, his expression 
               changing from concern to delight.

</b>                         What is it? What is it?

               Carr Gomm hands her the letter. Never having touched Royal 
               stationary before, Mothershead handles it delicately. She 
               begins to read.

               Broadneck and the other committee members are seated at their 
               table, anxious to get the meeting underway. They talk among 
               themselves.

               The door opens and Carr Gomm and Treves enter. Treves seems 
               quite nervous, but Carr Gomm is relaxed and smiling.

               Treves sits and Carr Gomm takes his place at the head of the 
               table and raps his gavel.

                         in the interest of speed I think we 
                         should conclude a matter discussed 
                         previously, to wit, that of Mr. John 
                         Merrick, the Elephant Man...

               Broadneck explodes to his feet. Carr Gomm smiles at Treves, 
               who looks quite grim.

                         discussion of this disagreeable 
                         matter. Had we not ascertained that 
                         an Elephant Man is not acceptable as 
                         a patient? Have we not, very 
                         generously, allowed the creature to 
                         use two of our rooms until such time 
                         as he could be properly disposed of?

               Merrick is working on his cathedral, painting details with a 
               very fine brush.

               As he lifts the brush from the paint jar, a drop falls on 
               the table. Merrick carefully lays down the brush and wipes 
               up the spilled paint with a cloth.

                         The rules, gentlemen, the rules. In 
                         a society such as ours, it is of 
                         paramount importance that we not 
                         stray from the established order. 
                         Has that order not already been 
                         fearfully strained by allowing this... 
                         this... sideshow exhibit to take up 
                         residence, however temporary, in two 
                         very useful rooms, the purpose of 
                         which would be far better served in 
                         accommodating treatable patients, 
                         patients to whom this hospital was 
                         originally dedicated? I believe we 
                         have a duty...

               Carr Gomm still smiles. Treves is about to spring to Merrick's 
               defense, but Carr Gomm catches his eyes and motions for him 
               to remain silent. Treves is perplexed. Carr Gomm checks his 
               pocket watch.

               Merrick as before, busily working away. We see a ladybug 
               crawling slowly across the roof of the cathedral. Merrick 
               notices it and watches for a moment, then reaches up and 
               lays a finger alongside the bug. The bug crawls onto his 
               finger and Merrick holds it closer to him.

                         behind the clouds there is always 
                         the sun.

               We see a Royal carriage glide to a stop in front of the 
               hospital. A footman jumps down and opens the door. A very 
               elegantly dressed woman begins to emerge.

               Broadneck is still talking.

</b>                         ...In light of these facts, our course 
                         is clear. The question is not whether 
                         to accept this creature as a patient, 
                         the question is when will those rooms 
                         be vacated for use by better 
                         qualified, more deserving cases? I 
                         move that this Elephant Man be removed 
                         from the premises immediately. We

                         Chairman, shall we vote?

               Broadneck turns to Carr Gomm. Carr Gomm checks his watch and 
               clears his throat.

               Broadneck blusters with rage.

               Carr Gomm smiles and again checks his watch. Treves is very 
               nervous.

               We see two nurses, their backs to us, walking down the hall. 
               They start to go in a doorway when they stop suddenly, very 
               startled, and curtsey deeply.

               Mothershead comes into the hall, also curtseying madly. She 
               is followed by the elegantly dressed woman, who is followed 
               in turn by two footmen. They walk regally down the hall.

               Quite red in the face, Broadneck looks at Carr Gomm, then to 
               Treves, then to the Princess. He seems to almost deflate, 
               then slowly raises his hand. The other members, now thoroughly 
               confused, raise their hands as well. Carr Gomm bangs his 
               gavel, smiling broadly. Treves is almost beside himself with 
               happiness, and the Princess is obviously very pleased.

               Merrick looks about him at his rooms. It's beginning to dawn 
               on him that this is indeed his, that at last he has a real 
               home, a place of his own.

               Treves hands Merrick the package. Merrick carefully pulls 
               off the wrapping paper. Treves smiles. It's the dressing 
               bag. Merrick is overjoyed with the gift. He lovingly handles 
               the articles, taking them in and out of their compartments 
               opening and closing the bag.

               Clouds billowing, moving swiftly.

<b>               MERRICK'S ROOM
</b>
               Merrick is alone, wearing his cloak and standing by the table, 
               cradling the dressing bag. He takes each article out of the 
               bag and lays it carefully on the table, all in very neat 
               order. He stares at the elegant objects, then rearranges 
               them.

               Merrick picks up the toothbrush, examining it with a sort of 
               reverence. He does the same with the ivory-handled razors 
               and the comb.

</b>
               There's a good crowd in tonight; lots of drinking and shouting 
               and glasses breaking. Several of the neighborhood "working 
               girls" are having a bit of a rest, looking for a laugh. The 
               Night Porter is rounding up customers, his pockets ringing 
               with coins. People have their hands raised urging the Night 
               Porter to take them along to see The Elephant Man. The Night 
               Porter goes to a table where a MAN sits with two of the girls.

                         Alright, alright, that's enough for 
                         this performance.

               The others all moan their disappointment.

               Bytes, sitting at his usual place at the bar, sees that 
               tonight is his chance.

               The Night Porter rounds up his "customers", all twelve of 
               them. Bytes saunters over to the Night Porter.

               Bytes drops several coins in the Night Porter's hand.

               The whole group happily leaves the pub, several still holding 
               their gin bottles. The Ladies are rather unsteady on their 
               feet. As they all leave, the Night Porter says:

<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER
</b>                         Quietly now! Quietly! We don't want 
                         to scare him.
                              (he laughs)

<b>               MERRICK'S ROOM
</b>
               (Merrick as before) he reaches over to the picture of Mrs. 
               Kendal and picks it up. We see his face reflected in the 
               glass. Merrick sets the picture down on the table. He takes 
               up one of the silver brushes and, using the picture as a 
               mirror, neatly brushes his hair over his monstrous skull. He 
               lays the brush down in its specific spot.

               Merrick takes his ring and puts it on his left hand. He opens 
               the cigarette case and stuffs one into his right hand. He 
               takes up his walking stick, breathes deeply, then walks around 
               the room in a slow circle. Merrick is transforming himself. 
               Merrick comes back to the table and examines his reflection 
               in the picture. With the ring, the stick, the cigarette and 
               his neatly brushed hair, Merrick is the very image of a 
               dashing young man about town. He inclines his head to the 
               picture.

                         very, VERY pleased to meet you!

               At this moment the door bursts open. The Night Porter stands 
               grinning.

<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER
</b>                         Curtain time!!!

               Merrick is frozen, caught. Seeing Merrick in his outfit, the 
               Night Porter's jaw drops. They both stare at each other. The 
               Night Porter begins to laugh hysterically. Merrick frantically 
               begins to put away his dressing bag articles. When Merrick 
               starts taking off his ring, the Night Porter comes over to 
               him and grabs him by the cloak.

<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER

                         a thing, darling. You look like the 
                         bleedin' Prince of Wales.

               The Night Porter drags him by the neck to the window. He 
               throws the window open out in the square is the waiting 
               audience.

               He strips off Merrick's cloak. The audience gasps. A few 
               people who have been before laugh and clap.

                         horrible... just horrible.

               He starts kissing each whore. The crowd is mesmerized. Bytes 
               moves in behind the Man with the Whores.

                         Perhaps the ladies would like a closer 
                         look?

               The Man begins to laugh. The Whores laugh drunkenly and 
               halfheartedly resist being taken in to see The Elephant Man. 
               As they are pushed through the door,

<b>                                     WHORES

                              (laughter)
                         Etc.

               The Whores reluctantly enter the room. The Night Porter laughs 
               at their discomfort. The Man notices all of Merrick's pictures 
               of women.

                         on... give the ladies' man a kiss.

               He lets one of the whores go and grabs the other one from 
               behind at the wrists.

<b>                                     MAN

                              trifle scared)
                         Come on, Jack.

               The Night Porter has turned Merrick and is holding him for 
               the approaching kiss. The crowd is egging them on. The man 
               forces the Woman closer and closer and raises her arms to 
               force her into an embrace. As Merrick and the Woman touch, 
               being pressed together, the Woman begins to scream. The Night 
               Porter, the Man and the crowd all laugh with glee. Merrick 
               and the whore now have their faces pressed together. The 
               Whore is screaming and Merrick is crying out and screaming 
               too.

                         bed.

               Merrick and the Whore are pushed onto Merrick's bed. The 
               Night Porter grabs the other Whore now. She begins screaming 
               wildly.

</b>                         A prince needs a harem!

               He pushes the screaming Whore down onto Merrick. Her screaming 
               face goes right into his. Merrick tries to move away and as 
               he does his head goes too far back and his cried turn to 
               horrible wheezing.

</b>                         Mind his head... You'll kill him.

               The crowd outside is trying to see in the window. Five or 
               six more have gone into Merrick's room to see. All are 
               laughing and screaming and trying to get a close look at The 
               Elephant Man.

                         see him.

               Merrick recognizes his voice and looks frantically around 
               for his former owner. The Night Porter pulls Merrick up by 
               the window again. He then begins pushing the crowd out the 
               door.

<b>                                     NIGHT PORTER
</b>                         Everyone outside!!!

               Suddenly one of the crowd outside reaches up and grabs 
               Merrick's good hand and pulls him half out the window. Others 
               follow suit and haul him all the way through. The cathedral 
               falls to the floor, breaking into several pieces.

               Because of the horror of touching him, the crowd outside 
               lets Merrick fall to the ground.

               The Night Porter whirls around and sees that Merrick is gone. 
               He pushes the rest of the people outside and quickly goes to 
               Merrick, lifting him to his feet.

               Unseen by anyone, Bytes slips into Merrick's room. Merrick 
               is now standing.

               The crowd moves in. The Night Porter is enjoying the 
               festivities, but looks around nervously for trouble.

<b>                                     ONE MAN
</b>                         Give 'im a drink.

               The Man grabs Merrick and pours some gin into his mouth, 
               then pushes him away.

               He's caught by another man, fed liquor and pushed away. He's 
               pushed now from person to person faster and faster. Finally 
               Merrick falls to the ground, dizzy and a bottle of gin on 
               Merrick's head. He coughs and moans through the wheezing. 
               The crowd is now strangely silent circling The Elephant Man 
               like a pack of dogs closing in on a terrified rabbit. Suddenly 
               Merrick starts to wail. The crowd joins in and they hoist 
               him above their heads, screaming with laughter, around and 
               around, joining him all the while.

               Now we see a window reflecting the scene of terror. A curtain 
               is pulled aside and we see through the reflection the face 
               of the Young Porter, watching everything.

               Merrick is lowered down into the crowd. it parts and the 
               Night Porter emerges walking Merrick toward us to his room.

               The crowd moves through the iron gate of Bedstead Square. In 
               the background we see Bytes' boy sitting on top of a wagon. 
               The Night Porter takes Merrick into his room and puts him on 
               the bed. He drunkenly stumbles about trying to out the room 
               in order. He places the smashed hulk of the cathedral back 
               up on its table, inadvertently leaving the spire and a few 
               columns on the floor. He picks the cloak up and replaces it 
               on the peg.

               He takes a purse full of coins out of his pocket. He removes 
               one small coin and flips it on the floor in front of Merrick.

               The Night Porter turns and leaves.

               Merrick, alone now, hears the Night Porter's echoing footsteps 
               and the distant sound of the gate being closed. There is a 
               long silence as Merrick collects himself. He then leans back 
               into his pillows with a deep sigh. His eyes close.

               Bytes lifts Merrick up off the bed. He reaches out for 
               Merrick's cloak. We slowly PAN over all the smiling women's 
               faces as we hear the following:

               Merrick's good hand comes into the frame trying to reach his 
               mother's picture.

               He grabs at the table cloth and pulls.

               Now we see Bytes gripping Merrick's arm and pulling. We see 
               the picture fall to the ground with a THUD.

               Morning sunlight on the floor of Merrick's room. We move 
               slowly around, discovering the church spire, the columns, 
               the penny and Merrick's mother's picture.

               Over this, the sound of knocking on the door. Through the 
               door, we hear Treves calling, "John?... John?" More knocking. 
               The door opens.

               Treves surveys the empty room. Quickly he goes into the side 
               bathroom. He comes out with a very worried face. He goes to 
               the cathedral model and is horrified by its condition. He 
               finds the spire and then Merrick's Mother's picture. He 
               quickly leaves the room and walks down the hall. The Young 
               Porter, waiting in the hall, approaches Treves and stops 
               him.

               Now we see Mrs. Mothershead entering Merrick's room surveying 
               the same scene.

               Her face hardens as she sees the picture of Merrick's Mother.

               Now we see Treves filled with anger. He's got the information 
               from the Young Porter and bolts down the hall at full speed.

               Mothershead, still in Merrick's room, now become activated 
               with determination to get to the bottom of all this herself. 
               She leaves the room. In the distance is Treves marching off. 
               Closer to her is the Young Porter, looking worried. She calls 
               him to her.

               The Night Porter is adding fresh coal to the operating room 
               stove. The old coals were still quite hot and now smoke begins 
               to rise. The Night Porter takes up the bellows and begins to 
               pump the coals into a blaze.

               The door bangs open and Treves is there, standing stock still,

               Treves takes the Night Porter by the arm and begins to drag 
               him out. The Night Porter throws his hand off violently, 
               whirls around, his back to the door, and seizes the poker 
               from the stove.

               Treves, blind with fury, tears the poker from the Night 
               Porter's hand, and is on the verge of using it. Unbeknownst 
               to them, Mothershead has storm into the room, just in time 
               to hear the last of the Night Porter's speech. Without a 
               break, she strides over to him and with a lightning movement, 
               boxes him soundly on the ears. The blow is staggering and 
               makes quite a formidable sound. The Night Porter falls to 
               the floor, barely conscious.

               Treves is standing in the street looking at the now bare 
               shop front. He walks to the window and tries to clean a small 
               circle in the glass. He peers in.

               From inside, through the smeared dirty window, we see Treves'

</b>
<b>               INSIDE A WAGON
</b>
               A moving circle of light in blackness.

               As we move closer to the light, it becomes distinguishable 
               as a peephole in the side of a wagon. Through the peephole 
               we see a dark overcast sky. It is dusk. We move even closer 
               to the hole. Just beside it we see the head of a horse with 
               blinders on moving alongside. We move closer still to see 
               its rider, a policeman. He notices the peephole and leans 
               forward in the saddle, looking in.

               From outside, we see the peephole and an eye gazing out. The 
               eye is replaced by a plug.

               The policeman starts back and pulls up on the reins. As he 
               falls behind we see the portrait of the E.M., from the front 
               of the shop in London, on the back of the wagon. The policeman 
               looks at the poster. The wagon moves on out of frame and the 
               policeman slows his horse to a stop.

               The wagon is being driven by Bytes. The boy sits beside him. 
               Another policeman rides abreast of him. They ride a few yards 
               more and then the policeman stops by a sign at the fork of 
               the road, reading "AALST 30 km". "Brussells 80 km." The 
               policeman gestures for Bytes to move on. The wagon continues 
               down the road.

               Bytes and the boy are riding along the road. Bytes turns in 
               his seat and opens a hatch in the roof. He looks down in.

               Inside the wagon, lit by the last dregs of the sunset, is 
               Merrick, huddled in his sleeping posture. He feels the light 
               and looks up weakly, wheezing, obviously very sick. A small 
               bowl of potatoes sets untouched beside him.

               He snaps the hatch shut and turns forward muttering to 
               himself.

<b>               FIELD & ROAD (MORNING)
</b>
               We see a field with a road in the distance, leading to it. 
               It is misty, the sun barely peeking through the rolling clouds 
               above. On the road, the wagon is plodding toward us. At the 
               bottom of the frame a FEMALE PINHEAD in a dress comes into 
               view. She is watching the wagon. A DWARF comes into view 
               beside her. She points to the wagon and she and the Dwarf 
               excitedly confer. They turn back to watch its progress and 
               the Dwarf reaches up and takes the Pinhead's hand.

               We move back slowly to reveal a ring of circus wagons in the 
               field.

               ANOTHER DWARF comes up to the two other Freaks and watches 
               the wagon. We pull back further to see a small circus. There 
               are little stalls, and cages containing two mangey lions, 
               some screeching spider monkeys and some squawking parrots. 
               The circus is abustle in the drab grey field.

               CLOSE-UP of the Pinhead jumping up and down in her excitement. 
               There is a clap of thunder.

</b>
               A rainstorm over the freak show. We pass along the row of 
               freak wagons.

               These freaks truly deserve the name. They are quite different 
               from the rather domestic ones we saw in the circus in England. 
               These are not fakes. A rope cordons us off from them.

               The audience, which we see all around us, is enjoying the 
               freaks, but there is a sense of vulgarity in their gaiety. 
               They seem hard, and cold and jaded.

               We move by pinheads, a Hermaphrodite and a Legless Wonder. 
               Some Siamese Twins are playing cat's cradle. Past them runs 
               a Dwarf with a plumed hat playing a small flute. Trailing 
               behind him on a string is a small wooden ark on wheels.

               A lionfaced man is combing the hair that covers his face. A 
               Rubber Man pulls the skin of his neck up over his face. There 
               is a fairly big crowd standing around a Tall Man, 
               affectionately rubbing the Small Parasitic Twin, growing out 
               of his chest. The Barker-Owners compete with each other and 
               the occasional thunder.

               Finally we hear the patter of Bytes, telling of the horrible 
               fate of John Merrick's Mother on that African Isle so many 
               years ago. A very big crowd is listening to him. They are 
               looking at the poster at the back of the wagon, waiting 
               impatiently to see the Elephant Man.

               He raps twice with Merrick's silver-tipped walking stick and 
               pulls the poster up. Merrick is standing unsteadily in the 
               wagon. He is quite sick. The audience gasps and shudders. A 
               few shrieks are heard. The Elephant Man is always the Elephant 
               Man.

               Merrick slowly turns around, the audience gasping at the 
               sight of the horrible tumors. Bytes raps the walking stick 
               twice.

               Merrick begins a series of awkward movements, his pained 
               version of a dance.

               Without his walking stick it is very difficult for him, but 
               he strives to do it. Some of the crowd laughs at this, others 
               shudder at the strange sight.

               Suddenly Merrick falters and comes to a stop, breathing 
               irregularly. Seeing this, Bytes goes to him and bringing the 
               stick behind Merrick, out of view of the audience, jabs him 
               savagely in the back.

               Merrick groans with pain and some of the people in the first 
               row flinch back.

               Merrick begins to dance again as people throw coins onto the 
               stage, which the boy gathers and puts into a cap.

               The poster is rolled up, Merrick on the floor of the wagon 
               wheezing horribly.

               Beside him on the floor is a bowl of what looks to be slop 
               and potatoes.

               Bytes is standing at the back of the wagon looking down at 
               Merrick. He picks up the bowl and jabs it at Merrick.

               Merrick looks wearily at the bowl but makes no move to accept 
               it.

               his throat.

               At this last word he throws the contents of the bowl

               down at Merrick who has lapsed into a coughing fit.

               There is a small crowd gathered in a circle on the grass. 
               Merrick stands amidst them on a small wooden stool, Bytes 
               jabbing him from behind again.

               Merrick is making a strange moaning cry, slightly reminiscent 
               of the trumpet of an elephant. The boy is passing amongst 
               the people with a cap, collecting coins. Merrick lifts his 
               face to the sky, the sound of his own misery mingling with 
               his elephant call.

               We see the poster of the Elephant Man. Bytes stands before 
               it saying the last of the patter.

               He raps twice with the walking stick and pulls the poster 
               up.

               Merrick is now extremely sick. He almost looks as if he is 
               unable to stand.

               The audience, as always, is quite alarmed. Bytes smiles and 
               comes forward.

               Merrick looks incapable of even this simple movement, but he 
               slowly manages to turn. The crowd reacts to the horrible 
               condition of Merrick's back and head.

               Bytes satisfied that the Elephant Man is having the proper 
               effect, raps the walking stick again.

               Merrick's eyes look painfully up to the heavens and he begins 
               to shuffle clumsily about the platform. Without his stick 
               this is very difficult for him, causing him great pain. It 
               is a humiliating spectacle and the crowd unimpressed by the 
               halting movements of the monster begins to heckle him.

               Bytes seeing that the dancing isn't being received well moves 
               to place a stool next to Merrick.

                         Up! Up!

               Merrick, already exhausted by his little dance, wheezes and 
               coughs, attempting to ascend the stool. It is useless, he is 
               just too tired. Again the audience shouts its disapproval, 
               booing and hissing the Elephant Man. Bytes curses and raps 
               again, demanding obedience from Merrick who again bravely 
               tries to mount the stool. He cannot do it!

               Bytes, striving to save the moment and please the angry crowd, 
               goes to Merrick and roughly helps him up. Merrick teeters 
               precariously on the stool. Bytes raps the stick.

               Merrick hesitates and Bytes bangs the stick on the wagon. 
               The audience quiets down to hear the elephant call. Merrick 
               senses this lull, but he is very frightened and sick. He 
               lifts his head wearily and makes a few wavering cries that 
               sound very little like an elephant.

               Merrick tries again but there is no improvement. The crowd 
               begins to jeer at

               Merrick, exhorting him to make the call of the elephant. 
               Merrick is now almost swaying on the stool. He attempts to 
               step down, but as he does it finally becomes too much for 
               him and he collapses into a heap on the wagon floor. The 
               crowd is no longer in the least bit challenged by this piteous 
               mess and they break out into a vocal fury, throwing objects 
               at the wagon.

               Bytes is humiliated at first, and then is quickly angry. He 
               turns to Merrick.

               But Merrick just lays there moaning and wheezing irregularly.

               He jabs Merrick a few times with the silver-tipped walking-
               stick. The crowd jeers even louder still. There is a clap of 
               thunder.

<b>               SMALL CIRCLE OF WAGONS (NIGHT)

               Bytes is seated by a campfire drinking from a bottle of wine. 
               He is very drunk. From the wagon behind him we can hear 
               Merrick coughing and wheezing.

               We also hear the boy, almost pleading with Merrick to stop 
               coughing and to try to eat. As Bytes listens he gets angrier 
               and angrier. Finally he rises clumsily to his feet and 
               stumbles over to the back of the wagon.

               The boy is crouched over Merrick, who looks little better 
               than a corpse.

               Bytes points a menacing finger at Merrick.

                         flesh.

               He reaches in and grabs Merrick roughly by his arm, dragging 
               him out of the wagon.

               He drags Merrick across the way to a small monkey wagon. The 
               boy follows, his face filled with sympathy for Merrick. Bytes 
               opens the cage door and stuffs Merrick in as the monkeys 
               scream.

               He slams the door and latches it. Then he quickly turns, 
               still in his rage, and starts for the wagon. As he passes 
               the boy, the boy tries to stop him.

               Bytes knocks the boy down with the back of his hand. He stalks 
               to his wagon and climbs inside. After some muffled sound, 
               Merrick's food bowl comes flying out. There are more muffled 
               sounds as Merrick's stick, cloak and hood are also thrown 
               out one by one.

               The boy looks to Merrick who is in a panic trying to keep 
               himself away from the monkeys who scream loudly in all the 
               excitement. We hear Bytes, cursing to himself, in the wagon. 
               The boy, frightened, goes to the fire and pulls a blanket 
               around him.

               Merrick crawls to one corner of the cage away from the 
               screaming monkeys.

               Suddenly one of the braver ones leaps at Merrick with a 
               scream, biting him on the arm, and moving quickly away. 
               Merrick yelps with pain and struggles to move away. The other 
               monkeys have gotten the idea now and they begin to move warily 
               toward Merrick, screeching threateningly. Another leaps out 
               and clings to Merrick's shoulder, biting and scratching 
               furiously then he too jumps away.

               Merrick cries out.

               Now the monkeys are getting braver and more and more of them 
               lash out at Merrick with their paws. They jump onto him with 
               savage screams, biting him on the head and neck and shoulders. 
               Merrick's eyes search for escape. The monkeys come on and on 
               without a break, screaming madly all the while.

               With his good hand Merrick begins to pull himself up with 
               the aid of a bar.

               The monkeys strive to pull him down. Merrick looks through 
               the bars at the wagon and screams frantically.

               But Bytes won't come. Something is happening inside Merrick. 
               A wave of feeling is growing, coming from a place in him 
               very deep down and far away.

               This feeling seems to give him strength and he is able to 
               pull himself all the way up in spite of the hairy moving 
               mass that now seems to cling to every part of his body.

               The feeling is surging up inside Merrick making his body 
               shake uncontrollably as if he were a volcano about to erupt. 
               The monkeys keep on biting and screeching, pulling at him. 
               Suddenly a formidable cry rings out of Merrick's mouth, with 
               a power and assurance we have never heard from him before. 
               He whirls about and cries out again a shattering "No", the 
               force of which scatters most of the monkeys away from him 
               onto the cage floor, dumbfounded.

               Merrick grabs a monkey who has managed to hang and throws it 
               into the group of monkeys on the floor.

               The monkeys have been shocked into silence, pushed into the 
               other end of the cage. Merrick, perhaps as surprised as the 
               monkeys, rests against the bars of the cage. The monkeys 
               make no move toward him. They sit across the cage from Merrick 
               silently watching him with fear.

               We now see Merrick crouched in a corner of the cage in his

               We see the monkeys again, and hear whispering in the still 
               night. CU of merrick's head resting on his knees. The 
               whispering continues and a shadow falls across Merrick. 
               Merrick begins to stir, his head comes up, and he looks 
               around. The whispering stops.

               We pull back to see some of the freaks from the circus 
               gathered around the monkey cage in a small group. They are: 
               2 pinheads (male and female), the dwarf we saw earlier with 
               the plumed hat and the ark on a string, another male dwarf, 
               a female midget, a lion-faced man, and an armless wonder. 
               The female pinhead reaches into the cage and pats Merrick's

               He looks to the lion-faced man and speaks to him in a foreign 
               tongue. The lion-faced man unlatches the cage door. Then, 
               after further instruction, from the plumed dwarf, the freaks 
               gently help Merrick out of the cage, closing the door behind 
               him. The dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion-faced 
               man and the armless wonder move to each side of Merrick. The 
               lion-faced man pulls Merrick's right arm over his shoulder. 
               Merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder.

                         away from here...

               He and the other dwarf light two lanterns and they begin to 
               move off.

               The boy by the wagon has awakened. He sees the small caravan 
               of freaks moving in the darkness, the light from the lanterns 
               bobbing over the grass. His first instinct is to call for 
               Bytes, which he almost does, but then he thinks better of 
               it. He rises and goes to where Bytes threw Merrick's stick 
               and disguise.

               He nicks them up and goes to the small band of strangely 
               shaped beings. They stop and watch him warily.

                         Here... you'll need these.

               Merrick looks the boy in the eye, and the boy holds his gaze.

               The small band moves away through the wagons. The boy watches 
               the lantern light receding in the darkness. He turns and 
               looks to the wagon, the poster of the Elephant Man, and the 
               dying fire. He moves to the fire quickly collecting a few 
               blankets and belongings. Then taking one last look at the 
               garish poster just visible in the night, he runs off into 
               the darkness.

               We see the beams of the lanterns moving through the trees 
               like will-o-the-wisps.

               They help Merrick along, the plumed Dwarf directing them 
               from time to time. As they move along we see them pass a 
               small still pond.

<b>               DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
               The intrepid freaks approach a bend in the road. They go 
               around the corner and before them stands a small train 
               station, a train sitting amongst the steam by a platform. 
               The freaks stop just outside the light of the station and 
               the plumed Dwarf's instruction get Merrick into his disguise. 
               The female pinhead, who has carried his stick, hands it to 
               Merrick, squeezing his hand.

<b>                                     MERRICK
</b>                         Thank you, my friends.

               The plumed Dwarf relays the message and the freaks respond 
               to Merrick in their language.

                         ticket.

               He turns and confers with the freaks who all rifle through 
               their pockets and produce some coins. Then he and Merrick 
               walk into the station, the freaks watching and waving.

<b>               ON THE PLATFORM
</b>
               The train is about to leave. At a barrier two ticket 
               collectors are taking tickets of a few last-minute passengers, 
               who hurry off.

               The Plumed Dwarf and Merrick appear and walk to the barrier. 
               The Plumed Dwarf hands over the ticket.

                         board.

               They walk off down the platform. The collectors stare after 
               them.

               The Plumed Dwarf, his arm around Merrick, is helping him 
               down the platform, as fast as possible, his ark trailing 
               behind him. As they pass the windows of the first-class 
               carriages, we see the ornate interiors and the happy, handsome 
               people on their plush seats.

               The Plumed Dwarf finds an empty compartment and opens the 
               door.

</b>                         This'll do.

               He looks down the platform. The Ticket Collectors are watching 
               them with great interest.

               Merrick climbs laboriously aboard.

               The other people on board see Merrick, react, and move away 
               from him as far as they can in the cramped, 3rd class 
               carriage.

               The Plumed Dwarf notices this and sniffs at the people with 
               contempt.

                         had.

                         London. You're a great attraction.

               He grins. The whistle blows and the train slowly begins to 
               move off. The Plumed Dwarf still holding the door open, walks 
               along with it.

<b>                                     PLUMED DWARF
</b>                         Luck, my friend, luck. Who needs it 
                         more than we?

               Merrick nods "yes", and holds out his hand. The train is 
               moving a little faster. The Plumed Dwarf grabs his hand and 
               they shake.

               He shuts the door. As the carriage passes, Merrick's mask is 
               pressed up against the window. The Plumed Dwarf waves to him 
               as the train moves away.

               He looks at the train for a moment, then walks back down the 
               platform.

<b>               THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE - INTERIOR
</b>
               Merrick is in the corner, facing into the carriage. He looks 
               slowly around.

               The other passengers have moved away, forming almost a moat 
               of space around him. We see the whole carriage now; the 
               cowering people and Merrick at the far end. Seeing their 
               silent, horrified stares, he moves to the opposite seat, 
               facing the back wall. Merrick looks around for a moment, 
               then sees his reflection in the window. He stares at himself.

<b>               THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE
</b>
               The carriage is dark now, and empty except for Merrick. He 
               looks out the window at a sign above a station platform that 
               says "Oostende", and at the few people still walking about.

<b>               OOSTENDE STATION PLATFORM (NIGHT)
</b>
               We see the side of the carriage. Merrick, inside the darkened 
               car, is not visible. A CONDUCTOR walks to the end of the 
               carriage and turns a valve. He opens the door to Merrick's 
               compartment.

<b>                                     CONDUCTOR
</b>                         I'm sorry, you'll have to leave now.

               Merrick is motionless, reluctant to leave the security of 
               the darkness.

<b>                                     CONDUCTOR
</b>                         This is the end of the line, you'll 
                         have to leave now.

               Merrick pulls his walking stick from the darkness and plants 
               it firmly on the floor with a loud THUD. The Conductor, 
               expecting violence, draws back. A few people on the platform, 
               who have stopped to watch this exchange, gasp.

               Merrick rises with the help of his stick, and slowly descends 
               from the carriage watched very carefully by the others. He 
               looks around for a moment, then walks off down the platform. 
               TWO YOUNG TOUGHS follow a little distance behind him, laughing 
               and mimicking his uneven gait.

<b>               OOSTENDE QUAY (NIGHT)
</b>
               We see a short line of people waiting to board a cross-channel 
               steamer. The First-Mate is standing by the gangplank, smiling 
               at the women passengers and making the most of his handsome 
               face and crisp white uniform. He surveys the line, stops and 
               smiles even more broadly. A very pretty Young Woman at the 
               end of the line is smiling back.

               We see the end of the quay disappearing into darkness towards 
               the station.

               The rhythmic sound of Merrick's stick is heard as he slowly 
               moves into the light.

               The Woman, still smiling at the First-Mate, demurely lowers 
               her eyes. Merrick appears behind her, breathing heavily from 
               the long walk. The woman's face freezes. She turns her head, 
               ever so slightly, and sees Merrick. Her face drops.

               The First-Mate sees the Woman change, then sees Merrick. He 
               walks out of frame. Merrick is still trying to catch his 
               breath as the First-Mate walks up. The Woman looks up at the 
               First-Mate imploringly.

<b>                                     FIRST-MATE
</b>                         May I see your ticket?

               Merrick, confused at first, produces his ticket from his 
               cloak. The First-Mate examines it and hands it back.

<b>                                     FIRST-MATE

                         for the next one, in the morning.

               Merrick remains motionless.

<b>                                     FIRST-MATE
</b>                         You heard me. There's no room. Now 
                         be off with you.

               He points down the quay. Merrick turns and walks away. The 
               Woman smiles gratefully at the Fist-Mate, who tips his hat.

<b>               A WAREHOUSE PIER
</b>
               TWO DRUNKS are sitting against the wall, drinking and singing. 
               One of them gets up and walks out of frame.

               Merrick peeks around a corner at the Drunk. They stare at 
               each other for a long moment. Merrick disappears. The other 
               Drunk comes back, sits down, and they both start singing 
               again.

               Merrick is in darkness, seated around the corner, tapping 
               his left hand against his leg, keeping in time with the 
               drunken music.

<b>               OOSTENDE QUAY (MORNING)
</b>
               We see Merrick behind some crates, watching the ship. On the 
               wharf a different First-Mate waits until the last of the 
               morning passengers board the ship. He then nods to the Ticket 
               Taker and ascends the gangplank, nodding to a crew man. On 
               board, everyone prepares to get underway.

               Merrick pitches forward from behind the crates, half running, 
               half stumbling toward the Ticket Taker. The Ticket Taker, 
               about to board the ship, drops the tickets on the ground and 
               stoops to pick them up. As he collects the scattered tickets 
               a hand comes into frame holding a ticket out to him. He 
               reaches for it, and calls over his shoulder to the crewman 
               at the plank.

</b>                         Wait! One more!

               He turns back and finally takes a look at the late arrival.

<b>                                     TICKET TAKER
</b>                         You'll have to hurr...

               His mouth drops. Merrick hurries past him. The crewman now 
               also sees the passenger as he begins his clumsy ascent of 
               the gangplank. The shrill ship's whistle blows.

<b>               ON BOARD
</b>
               Merrick is crouched in a dark corner underneath a stairway, 
               his head resting on the points of both knees, his arms clasped 
               around them. He is asleep. A few drops of rain fall and hit 
               his cap, then a few more and finally it begins to rain. He 
               wakes up and looks around. He hears a voice.

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)

               Through the stairs we see a young couple in the rain at the 
               railing, arm in arm. The Young Woman points. The Young Man 
               turns to her and smiles.

               They laugh and hug each other and run inside out of the rain. 
               Merrick's hand comes into the shot, grasping a stair and 
               pulling himself up slowly. He rounds the stairs and walks 
               onto the deck looking after the young couple.

               Merrick walks to the railing and leans over it, oblivious of 
               the rain. We see the cliffs of Dover.

               The ship's gangplank leading down to a sea of umbrellas. 
               Passengers one by one come down the plank and are swallowed 
               by the crowd. On the dock amidst the umbrellas, we see 
               Merrick. He looks around, then moves off into the crowd. The 
               crowd moves past a sign saying, "To The Trains".

               Through a rain-streaked window we see rolling green 
               countryside. We pull back to see an Elderly Man in a heavy 
               black overcoat with a wide-brimmed rain hat eating an apple. 
               Beside him his wife knits.

               A few other people similarly clothed are sleeping. We PAN 
               across them to see Merrick at the back of the car watching 
               the Elderly Man eat.

<b>               LONDON TRAIN - EXTERIOR
</b>
               The last car speeds down the track and disappears.

<b>               LIVERPOOL STREET STATION
</b>
               Grey light filters through the windows in the high canopy 
               ceiling over the trains in the station. The platforms below 
               fill with people as trains arrive and depart. We now see the 
               station with its newsstands, sweetstalls, shoeshiners, and 
               passengers moving to and fro, carrying luggage and looking 
               for their train.

               A YOUNG BOY is seated on a pile of baggage looking very adult 
               and bored. His MOTHER stands beside him, though we see only 
               a portion of her billowy skirt.

               We hear her voice in rapid conversation with another Woman. 
               The Young Boy scans the crowd looking for excitement. He 
               sees something.

               The Elderly Man we saw on the train and his wife are moving 
               past the barrier.

               The Young Boy slowly pulls a peashooter from a pocket, puts 
               a pea in his mouth, and raises the pipe to his lips. His 
               Mother's hand shoots out and grabs it.

<b>                                     MOTHER'S VOICE
</b>                         Little beast! I thought mummy told 
                         you not to bring that horrid thing. 
                         Can't you behave?

               She continues her conversation. The Boy looks sour. Merrick 
               is moving past the barrier. He stops to look around and plan 
               his next move. The Boy sees him. He tugs on his Mother's 
               skirt.

<b>                                     BOY
</b>                         Mummy! Mummy! Look at that man! His 
                         head, it's huge! Mummy, why is his 
                         head so big? Mummy? Mummy?

<b>                                     MOTHER
</b>                         Do be quiet Little Jim. Can't you 
                         see Mummy is speaking?

               Merrick still looking around, suddenly turns in Little Jim's 
               direction. He sees the Boy tugging at his Mother's skirt and 
               pointing at him.

               He turns and walks in the opposite direction along a wall 
               stacked with trunks and luggage, trying as best as he can to 
               blend in. Little Jim gets up and moves after him.

               Merrick continues along the wall. A few people give him a 
               second look, but pass on. Little Jim comes up alongside him.

<b>                                     LITTLE JIM
</b>                         Hey Mister, why is your head so big?

               Merrick turns and looks at Little Jim. He looks quickly 
               around. We see, across the station, an open archway leading 
               out into a street. Merrick moves away from Little Jim out of 
               frame. Little Jim watches him go.

<b>                                     LITTLE JIM
</b>                         Mister!

               Two other BOYS join Little Jim. The three of them watch the 
               escaping Merrick, then move off after him. Merrick is 
               frantically trying to make it to the archway. The three boys 
               appear behind him and call out.

<b>                                     BOYS
</b>                         Mister! Mister!

<b>                                     LITTLE JIM
</b>                         Why don't you answer me?

               One of the boys reaches down and snatches the hem of Merrick's 
               cloak. He lifts it, trying to catch a glimpse of the 
               mysterious stranger. Merrick pulls away and tries to go 
               faster. Relishing the hunt, the boys follow him, taunting 
               him all the way. As they approach the arch, Little Jim, 
               determined now, steps in front of him cutting him off.

               Merrick comes to an abrupt standstill, shrinking from the 
               boy. Little Jim reaches up to the hood and grasps it firmly.

<b>                                     LITTLE JIM
</b>                         Now I'll see you...

               He lifts the hood and then staggers back onto the floor in a 
               spasm of fear.

               He lets out a shrill scream. Merrick turns wildly away, 
               looking for another escape. Little Jim's Mother, hearing her 
               son's cries, looks up immediately.

               She sees Merrick and the howling boy in the middle of the 
               station.

<b>                                     MOTHER
</b>                         My son! My son! Help!

               Merrick, hearing this, looks in her direction and whirls 
               away. He stumbles toward another archway exit. People, hearing 
               the noise, watch him go. He knocks down a little girl in his 
               flight and she, too, starts screaming.

               Through the archway comes a bobby. Jim's Mother, now with 
               her son, calls to him.

<b>                                     MOTHER
</b>                         Stop that man! Stop that man!

               Merrick stops at the sight of the bobby. The bobby at the 
               arch, now aware of the commotion, sees Merrick and walks 
               quickly towards him.

               Merrick changes course, but, a group of men, alerted by Jim's 
               mother's screams, move forward together, cutting him off. 
               They yell at him angrily.

               One of them darts toward him and grabs a hold of Merrick's 
               hood. Merrick turns frantically away and as he does, the 
               hood is pulled off him. The crowd shouts at him as he goes, 
               following him in wary pursuit. He moves back past the children 
               and Jim's Mother. They all scream and shield themselves from 
               his approach. Another group of people move toward him blocking 
               all escape.

               Behind him, he sees a door to a urinal. He moves through it 
               followed by the crowd. We hear fearsome echoes inside.

               Inside the urinal, the crowd presses Merrick toward a wall. 
               They have become angry now. They shout and there is fear in 
               their voices. They hem Merrick in. He looks around hoping 
               for an opening. There is none.

               He gives a strangled cry and collapses as the bobby pushes 
               his way through the crowd.

               Merrick puts his good hand over his good ear trying to block 
               out the screams of the crowd.

               A small room off the Receiving Room. In the center of the 
               room is a low sofa covered with deeply stained, shiny black 
               leather. On it lies a man, groaning softly. Treves is helping 
               a Dresser bandage the man's leg.

               Mrs. Mothershead appears at the doorway.

               Treves enters and pushes through the crowd. He sees Merrick 
               in a heap on the floor. The SERGEANT gets up to meet him in 
               the middle of the room, but Treves keeps walking toward 
               Merrick.

               Treves goes to Merrick who, just coming to, reaches out to 
               him with his good hand. Treves pulls him up, his eyes brimming 
               with tears. Merrick, too, is weeping. Treves embraces him.

               Merrick stands before the row of smiling ladies on his wall. 
               He surveys them lovingly for a long moment. He is holding in 
               his hand a bundle of evening clothes, the handsome black bow 
               tie lying on the new silk shirt.

                         to be my fate to fall in love with

               He stands for a moment, reluctant to leave their company. He 
               goes to his bed placing the clothes upon it, and then to the 
               cathedral. He compares it with St. Phillips outside. He picks 
               up the main spire and gazes at it, but his mind is somewhere 
               else.

</b>
<b>               THEATRE ROYAL - DRURY LANE
</b>
               We see the whole theatre. It is very ornate. The orchestra 
               is tuning up and the house is filled with elegant, well 
               dressed, handsome people all happily chatting and calling to 
               one another. We see young men and women flirting boldly and 
               generally enjoying each other's company. In the Royal Box 
               Mothershead and Nora in evening gowns sit up front relishing 
               the spectacle.

               In the back of the box John sits between Treves and the 
               Princess. He is dressed in his evening clothes, his cloak 
               tied over his shoulders like a cape, but he does not wear 
               his hood.

               The Princess is explaining to Merrick the workings of a pair 
               of opera glasses.

               He takes them and delightedly spies about the theatre.

               John is breathless as the house lights dim and the curtain 
               rises. Enter chorus.

               Treves smiling at John. He exchanges knowing smiles with the 
               Princess. John watches with the unconstrained delight of a 
               child; but his rapture is even more intense and solemn. His 
               attitude is one of wonder and awe, and he often leans forward, 
               panting in his excitement. To John the characters are not 
               actors in make-up and costume, but real people.

                         What! A speaker is but a prater; a

               During the above, Merrick mouths the Kings lines.

                         is the first time he's ever actually 
                         been here. I would like to dedicate... 
                         the whole company wishes to dedicate,

                         performance to Mr. John Merrick, my 
                         dear friend.

               She gestures toward the Royal Box. There is modest applause 
               as the audience rises and turns toward it. Merrick cannot be 
               seen in the shadows, and the crowd cranes their necks trying 
               to get a glimpse of him. We hear whispers of "Oh look! It's 
               the Elephant Man! The Elephant Man!' run through the audience. 
               Treves turns to John.

               Merrick rises and comes forward to thunderous applause. The 
               audience begins to rise and they clap their hands even louder.

               Merrick is overcome by the applause. Tears run down his 
               cheeks. Treves, Nora, Mothershead and the Princess, filled 
               with pride, beam at John.

               Merrick, in a night-shirt, is seated at his table working on 
               his cathedral.

               Treves is nearby.

</b>                         Wasn't Mrs. Kendal wonderful? I can't 
                         blame the King for wanting to marry 
                         her.

               Merrick closes his eyes and his head tilts forward slightly. 
               It seems unbearably large: too large for him to support.

               Treves comes back to Merrick.

                         that you can see?

                         No, John, not one that I can see.

</b>                         No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.

               The two look at each other silently.

<b>                                     MERRICK
</b>                         ...I'll walk you to the door.

               Merrick rises and goes with Treves to the door.

<b>                                     TREVES
</b>                         Goodnight John. Sleep well.

</b>                         You too, my friend. Goodnight.

               Treves smiles at John then walks down the darkened hallway. 
               Merrick watches him for a moment, then slowly shuts the door. 
               We hear the distant echo of Treves footsteps. Merrick goes 
               back to examine his cathedral, looking at it from different 
               angles. He picks up a fine brush, dipping it into the paint, 
               and makes a few final brush strokes.

               He moves back into the middle of the room and gazes at it 
               for a long time. He lowers the brush to his side.

</b>                         It is finished.

               The cathedral is a masterwork of detail and shading, as if 
               it were St. Philips itself shrunk to a miniature. He goes to 
               the table, dips the brush into the paint and carefully signs 
               his name at the base of the main spire.

</b>                         John... Merrick!

               He sighs deeply, lays the brush down on the table and pushes 
               the model towards the window. The movement causes him pain. 
               He puts his left hand up and feels the back of his head. 
               Merrick turns out the lamp and goes to his bed. He looks at 
               the cathedral again, then around at his room. We see in the 
               dim light his books, his gallery of smiling women, his 
               dressing bag, his cloak and hood, and finally his mother's 
               picture on the table. A slight breeze billows the curtains. 
               We move in very close to them.

               A lacy curtain has taken the place of the sky. The elephants 
               seem to be moving on it... into the distance.

               Knock, knock sound. The curtain moves to one side wiping the 
               elephants away with it. There is no terrified audience behind 
               the curtain. There is only light and Merrick's Mother smiling 
               a calm and benign smile.

                         the cloud fleets, the heart beats...
