<b>               EXT. ST CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - DAWN
</b>
               An establishing shot of the rundown train station on an 
               overcast morning. There's snow on the station platform. A 
               train arrives and departs.

</b>                         In other parts of the world, young 
                         men of promise leave home to make 
                         their fortunes, battle evil, or solve 
                         the problems of the world.

               Behind the station, at the top of the hill, lies the St. 
               Cloud's orphanage.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         I was myself such a young man, when 
                         I came to save the orphanage in St. 
                         Cloud's... many years ago.

<b>               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
               A man and woman (COUPLE #1) make their way toward the main 
               entrance of the large brick building.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to 
                         understand that promises are rarely 
                         kept, that the battle isn't so much 
                         against evil as ignorance, and that 
                         being successful can't hold a candle 
                         to being of *use*.

               The couple enters the orphanage, where we hear the sound of 
               babies.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Nor have I solved the problem I came 
                         here to solve.

<b>               INT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING
</b>
               Two nurses, EDNA and ANGELA, chase CHILDREN--a morning 
               routine.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Even in the most enlightened times, 
                         unwanted babies will manage to be 
                         born. That there will always be 
                         orphans is simple not a problem to 
                         be solved. Here is St. Cloud's, we 
                         don't regard the sordid facts of 
                         life as problems.

               The camera goes up the stairs with some of the kids.

<b>               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               We enter an office where DR. LARCH shows couple #1 their 
               newly adopted son, HOMER, an infant who lies smiling in Dr. 
               Larch's arms.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         In truth, we've only had one real 
                         problem.

               We close in on the infant until his face fills the screen.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         His name was Homer Wells.

               Dr. Larch hands over the infant to the adopting parents.

<b>                                     LARCH
</b>                         I named him after the Greek writer. 
                         You know Homer, of course?

               Hesitant nods. (They don't look as if they read.)

<b>                                     LARCH
</b>                         I made his name "Wells" because I 
                         could tell he was very deep.

               The parents look with pride at their adopted son.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         In truth, Nurse Angela named him--
                         her father *drilled* wells, and 
                         "Homer" was one of her family's 
                         umpteen cats.

<b>               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
</b>
               At the front door, Larch and the nurses wave and call good-
               bye to Homer, they close the door.

<b>               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
</b>
               The same door swings open; it's another night. The same couple 
               is bringing Homer back. There is concern in their faces as 
               Nurse Edna lets them in.

<b>               INT. BOY'S DIVISION, DOORWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               Larch is delivering his benediction to the boys.

<b>                                     LARCH
</b>                         "Good night, you Princes of Maine, 
                         you Kings of New England!"

               As he turns, he is startled by Nurse Edna, waiting with couple 
               #1 and baby Homer.

<b>                                     ADOPTING MOTHER
</b>                         There's something wrong with him! He 
                         never makes a sound.

               Larch looks quickly at Homer.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         He didn't cry enough for them, if 
                         you can believe it.

<b>                                     ADOPTING FATHER
</b>                         Do you think we could have a look at 
                         someone a little different?

               The mother hands over the baby to Larch. Baby Homer lets out 
               a happy squeal as soon as he's in Larch's arms. The parents 
               stare in disbelief.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Thus was Homer Wells returned. He 
                         was too happy a baby.

<b>               EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY
</b>
               Angela and Edna call and wave good-bye to a two-year-old 
               Homer, leaving with COUPLE #2. Larch stands on the porch and 
               watches the family head down the hill.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         The second family has an unfortunate 
                         gift for getting sounds out of Homer.

<b>               INT. COUPLE #2'S HOME - DAY
</b>
               Larch bursts into the home of the second couple and lifts a 
               crying and bruised Homer out of his bed. There is rage in 
               Larch's eyes as he looks at the couple.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         The rumor was true. They beat him. 
                         He couldn't stop crying.

<b>               EXT. HILL, ST. CLOUD'S - DAY
</b>
               Larch carries Homer up the orphanage hill.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Here is St. Cloud's, I try to 
                         consider, with each rule I make or 
                         break, that my first priority is an 
                         orphan's future.

<b>               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
</b>
               The naked belly of a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         Easier said than done.

               A tiny hand comes in with a stethoscope and puts it on the 
               big belly. Young Homer's head, with the stethoscope around 
               his neck, pops up behind the belly; he closes his eyes as he 
               concentrates on listening to the sounds of the unborn child. 
               Larch stops in the doorway, catching sight of Homer. He smiles 
               faintly.

<b>               EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - DAY
</b>
               The door opens to a THIRD COUPLE smiling at us, welcoming 
               and embracing a sixteen-year-old Homer. Behind them waits 
               the would-be STEPSISTER--an attractive girl, a little older 
               then Homer.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         I told the third family to take good 
                         care--this was a special boy.

<b>               INT. STEPSISTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Homer and the stepsister are in bed together. The parents 
               burst in on them--the father chasing Homer around and around 
               the bed, the mother beating her daughter, who covers herself 
               with a pillow.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         It was Homer who took too much good 
                         care of himself.

<b>               EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - NIGHT
</b>
               From her window, the stepsister watches Homer leave the house 
               carrying his suitcase. Homer looks up at her as he walks to 
               the street.

<b>               EXT. ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
               It's after dawn, but still a little dark, as Homer walks to 
               the orphanage door, suitcase in hand. A HUGELY PREGNANT WOMAN 
               arrives at the same time. They stand awkwardly next to each 
               other, waiting for someone to answer the door. The woman is 
               crying. Homer reaches out and takes her hand.

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         Don't be frightened. Everyone is 
                         nice here.

<b>                                     PREGNANT WOMAN
</b>                         Do you live here?

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         I just belong here.

               The woman sniffles; she nods vaguely. The door opens. Nurse 
               Edna lets the woman in and embraces Homer.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         What could I do with him? He kept 
                         coming back!

<b>               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               Larch instructs an older Homer from "Gray's Anatomy." Homer 
               is bored and looks out the window.

<b>                                     LARCH
</b>                         Homer, if you're going to stay at 
                         St. Cloud's, I expect you to be of 
                         use.

<b>               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Homer looks adoringly at Dr. Larch as Larch examines ANOTHER 
               PREGNANT WOMAN. Larch waves Homer over; he places the boy's 
               hand on the woman's abdomen, to feel the fetus kicking.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         But, in failing to withhold love, 
                         had I created a true and everlasting 
                         orphan? I had been too successful 
                         with Homer Wells. I had managed to 
                         make the orphanage his *home*.

<b>               INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Larch closes a door quickly behind him (so that Homer doesn't 
               see the ABORTION PATIENT in the O.R.)

<b>               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Homer assists Larch in delivering a BABY.

<b>               EXT. INCINERATOR - DAY
</b>
               Homer carries a white enamel pail to the incinerator. He 
               looks inside the pail; he stops.

<b>                                     LARCH (V.O.)
</b>                         God forgive me. I have *made* an 
                         orphan by loving him too much. Homer 
                         Wells will belong to St. Cloud's, 
                         forever.

               Hold on Homer's disgusted expression as he stares at the 
               contents of the pail.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE. FADE OUT. We hear a song playing on an 
               old phonograph.

<b>               INT. DISPENSARY - DAY
</b>
               We see the song playing on the old phonograph. Dr. Larch is 
               taking ether. He holds the bottle in one hand, the cone over 
               his mouth and nose with the other.

<b>               SUPER: ST. CLOUD'S, MAINE, MARCH 1943.
</b>
               When Larch dozes off, his hand loosens its grip on the cone; 
               the cone falls off his face, and he wakes up. Then he puts 
               the cone back in place, dripping more ether from the bottle 
               to the gauze covering the cone.

               Pan the dispensary, which also serves as Larch's photo gallery 
               and bedroom apartment. The ether-bed is separated from the 
               room by a hospital curtain (the kind on casters). We see the 
               recording revolving, the glass-encased cabinets of medical 
               supplies, the old photographs of St. Cloud's.

               Homer enters, he stands uncomfortably, watching Larch for a 
               moment. Then he turns around and walks back into the corridor.

<b>               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
               Homer calls out as though he's just coming down the corridor.

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         Dr. Larch! Dr. Larch!

<b>               INT. DISPENSARY - DAY
</b>
               Larch wakes up; he shakes off the ether haze. Homer reenters.

<b>                                     HOMER
</b>                         We've got two new patients, one to 
                         deliver.

               Dr. Larch and Homer leave together.

<b>               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
               The *two* doctors walk briskly down the hall, a couple of 
               professionals.

</b>                         Yes, for both.

                         I presume you'd prefer handling the 
                         delivery.

                         All I said was, I don't want to 
                         perform abortions. I have no argument 
                         with *you* performing them.

               Homer enters; he walks quietly to his bed in the far corner 
               of the room, where he starts to undress.

               The girls, led by Mary Agnes, round a corner of the orphanage, 
               towing a sled piled high with snowballs.

               They shriek as the boys suddenly surprise them. Buster throws 
               two hard snowballs that hit Mary Agnes and CLARA (eight or 
               nine) before Mary Agnes overwhelms him and repeatedly sticks 
               his head in the snow. Copperfield, terrified of Mary Agnes, 
               escapes. Curly misses, then tips over the sled of snowballs 
               as Clara and the adorable HAZEL (five or six) throw him to 
               the ground. Fuzzy drops his one snowball; he runs aimlessly 
               in circles, coughing, as Nurse Edna explodes from a door of

               A NEW COUPLE comes up the hill. The orphans stop and stare, 
               brushing snow off themselves, struggling to make themselves 
               look presentable. Curly is desperate to look his best. Mary 
               Agnes doesn't bother to pretty herself. She whispers to Clara 
               and Hazel.

               Homer exchange a look.

               Homer sits down with 'David Copperfield.' There is quiet 
               anticipation while Homer readies himself to read.

               The children are chasing a ball near the incinerator.

               A VERY FRIGHTENED GIRL---not one of the orphans--is lying 
               next to the incinerator.

               Edna kneels by the strange girl, who cringes with fear.

                         breakfast? What's your name?

               The girl won't speak; when Edna touches the girl's forehead, 
               she pulls back her hand in alarm.

<b>               INT. OPERATING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
               Edna is holding the head of the frightened young girl. The 
               girl is feverishly hot and whimpering; she keeps looking at 
               her feet in the stirrups as if she's an animal caught in a 
               trap. Larch and Homer stand on either side of her.

               The girl shakes her head. The pain stabs her again.

                         Three months?

               Another stab of pain contorts the girl.

               The girl holds her breath while he examines her abdomen; 
               Homer very delicately examines the girl's abdomen, too.

               Homer holds the girl still--she is babbling on and on while 
               Larch is examining her.

               Larch, his wild eye peering into the speculum, makes an 
               audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the girl. 
               Larch tells Homer to have a look. Larch then whispers 
               something to Edna; she brings the ether bottle and cone 
               quickly. Larch starts putting the cone in place, over the 
               nose and mouth of the frightened girl. Homer bends to the 
               speculum.

                         enough.

               Homer stares into the speculum; he closes his eyes. The girl 
               is resisting the ether, but her eyelids flutter closed.

                         it's a crochet hook.

               Homer has pulled off his surgical mask. He leans over the 
               scrub sink, splashing cold water on his face.

               Homer, furious, leaves the operating room. Edna lifts the 
               girl's eyelids for Larch so that he can see how well under 
               the ether she is.

               Buster is distracted; he drives the truck into a ditch and 
               it bounces around, missing a tree by an inch. He is up on 
               the road again in a few seconds.

               They are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that 
               overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage. The fast car is 
               driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the Army Air Corps--
               a YOUNG OFFICER. From the passenger seat, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG 
               WOMAN smiles at them, rendering them speechless.

               The luxurious convertible (now parked) has drawn all the 
               orphans to it. The handsome young officer (WALLY) and the 
               beautiful young woman (CANDY) stand confused by the car; 
               they are surrounded by the curious orphans, with whom they 
               are painfully self-conscious. They are overly friendly to 
               the children as they are anxious of Larch and Homer and Buster 
               (in their gravedigging attire), who are getting out of the 
               truck. Nervously, Wally gives the children chocolates.

                         Yeah.

               The other orphans are dying with envy--Candy is so beautiful.

               Homer runs up the stairs, two steps at a time; he races into 
               a corridor at full speed, exhilarated. Suddenly Dr. Larch 
               appears in front of him. Homer stops abruptly, out of breath,

               As Homer stands guiltily, Larch rifles through an X-ray file, 
               holding various X rays up to the lit screen. He quickly finds 
               the one he's looking for, attaching it briefly to the screen 
               for a confirming look--a heart X ray, which Larch waves at

               Homer is grateful and ashamed. Before he can speak, Edna is 
               there--a wad of bills in her hand. She tries to put the money

               Candy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little.

               The car is parked at the side of the road. Wally is half-
               hidden behind a tree. Candy and Homer are left alone in the 
               car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to 
               hear Wally's excessive peeing. Suddenly Candy starts to sob.

               Wally signals to Homer to get out of the car.

               Later, Wally and Homer stand outside the car, overhearing 
               Candy's weeping. Homer is smoking nervously.

               Homer looks at Wally; he sees the authority in his eyes. 
               Homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot.

               They notice that Candy has stopped crying. Wally finds Candy 
               asleep in the backseat.

               The lone car on the road. Snatches of war news from the radio 
               are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark 
               highway.

<b>               EXT. COAST OF MAINE - MORNING

               The car is parked, with Homer sleeping in it alone. The sounds 
               of the ocean increase as Homer opens his eyes. Homer gets 
               out of the car and walks toward the beach, enchanted. There 
               it is: his first view ever of an ocean, the horizon, the sun 
               glimmering on the water. Candy is lying on a blanket in the 
               sand. Wally is throwing rocks in the water. Homer takes it 
               all in. When Candy calls for him, Homer walks up to her.

                         They'll ease up, almost entirely. As

               A football comes flying through the air toward Homer; it 
               bounces off his chest. Wally laughs.

               Homer throws the football; it's clear he's never thrown one 
               before.

               Homer runs over to Wally, who proceeds to show him how to 
               pass the ball. Snatches of his instruction drift to Candy, 
               who closes her eyes. "Put your fingers on the laces--no, it 
               rests in your palm, like this! You want the laces up--yes,

               Homer and Wally sit on the beach a short distance from Candy's 
               blanket. She appears to be asleep. Wally looks in her

               Homer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he 
               wouldn't have Wally's enthusiasm for the task. Wally laughs 
               and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder.

               Homer looks confused; he seems to have forgotten about the 
               alleged wedding. Wally puts his arm around Homer, urging him 
               into the hall.

                         Candy's, *everybody's*.

               Homer is embarrassed, but Olive is obdurately well-mannered.

               Wally calls to her as he pushes Homer down the hall.

               Homer and Wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a 
               barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line 
               after line of trees--the apple orchards.

               Homer sees an outdoor shower where THREE BLACK MEN are 
               showering. It is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's 
               occupants visible above and below their midsections. A FOURTH 
               BLACK MAN is caught naked, running behind the cider house 
               and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself.

                         to let him be the boss.

               Homer wonders what that means as Wally reaches for the door 
               of the cider house. Before Wally can knock, a pretty young 
               black girl, ROSE ROSE, bumps open the screen door with her 
               hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass--almost hitting

               This gets the attention of the men on their way from the 
               showers. They walk over, towels around their waists.

               The screen door swings open and shut again, startling them 
               all, as MR. ROSE comes out of the cider house.

               Grinning, Mr. Rose shakes Wally's hand. Rose Rose goes back 
               inside the cider house as Mr. Rose shakes Homer's hand. Homer 
               introduces himself.

                         fast learner.

               Mr. Rose looks briefly at the men, who wait for his reaction.

               Wally slaps Homer on the back; he goes inside the cider house 
               to help Rose Rose with the plumbing.

               Homer looks at Mr. Rose for instructions. Mr. Rose stares 
               back at him with his enigmatic smile.

                         a mess. If that shed was better 
                         organized, I could put my truck in 
                         there.

               Homer looks at Mr. Rose with an uncomprehending expression.

                         job before you do another.

               Homer thinks that over.

               Later, Homer is cleaning out the shed.

               The pickers all sit down to supper around a picnic table. 
               Homer with Mr. Rose, Rose Rose, and the other black pickers. 
               Mr. Rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table. Then he 
               pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion; he's so 
               fast, the knife seems to come out of nowhere. He begins to 
               peel the apple. Homer eyes Mr. Rose, but Mr. Rose's focus is 
               riveted to his apple and the long, perfect strand of peel 
               dangling from it.

               Homer decides to stop. Another silence.

               There are some disrespectful suggestions from the pickers 
               concerning what his heroism might have been.

               Homer unpacks his suitcase. (His bed should be nearest Muddy's 
               and Mr. Rose's.) Jack lies on his bed, smoking. Muddy, also 
               smoking, is sitting on his bed, sharpening a knife. Hero and 
               Peaches are playing cards on one of their beds. Mr. Rose is

               Rose Rose picks up the book that Homer has put on the bed. 
               She studies the cover; it's "Great Expectations" by Charles 
               Dickens. She puts it down, restlessly.

                         recall.

               Finished unpacking, Homer sits on his bed; he picks up "Great 
               Expectations" and begins to read. Rose Rose sits down next 
               to him, watching him read. Homer notices her interest.

               Homer smiles politely and goes back to his book. Rose Rose 
               keeps looking over his shoulder at the pages.

               Homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds, 
               smoking, listening. (Like bedtime stories at the orphanage, 
               he thinks; however, the picker's attitude is suspicious, 
               reserved.)

               Some muttering, some giggling, mostly silence. Rose Rose 
               wants more, but suddenly Jack jumps out of bed and stomps to 
               the kitchen end of the cider house, where a piece of paper 
               is tacked to the wall. Jack is talking to Homer all the way.

               Wally in his farm clothes at the wheel of the Jeep--he is

               house area.

               Candy has been waiting on the loading platform. The pickers

               Homer is walking with Wally and Candy. The orchards are 
               beautiful.

               Much activity: the pickers are unloading apple crates from a

               where Candy and Olive are saying a tearful good-bye to Wally. 
               Distracted, Homer drops another couple of apples, which Mr.

               Larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents of a

               only Mr. Rose doesn't appear to notice.

               We never see Mr. Rose's knife. We see the men circle each 
               other: Jack takes a swipe at Mr. Rose's head--then he steps 
               back, his yellow slicker slashed open. His slicker is opened 
               up, right up the middle. His shirt underneath the slicker is 
               slashed open, too--he feels his bare chest and stomach, 
               feeling for the cut. But there's no cut--Jack's not bleeding, 
               he's not even scratched. Just his clothes have been slashed.

               Mr. Rose has cut his own hand in the fight. Homer's 
               professionalism if offended to watch Rose Rose's amateurish

               Candy is moved. Homer feels exposed; he tries to change the 
               mood by making light of what he's said.

               Homer's expression changes from exhilarated to guilty. He 
               leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen. 
               Candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder. Homer looks 
               afraid to breathe.

               From behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a 
               normal couple. We track in toward the huge screen until we 
               see only the screen. There are shadows on the black screen. 
               Suddenly the movie "King Kong" appears.

               "King Kong" is playing against the bare, white wall. Fuzzy 
               is very weak, but he smiles at the sight of the love-struck 
               Kong holding the screaming Fay Wray in his giant hand. Dr. 
               Larch runs the projector; he sits close beside Fuzzy. When 
               the film breaks in the predictable place, Fuzzy makes no 
               protest. Dr. Larch looks at Fuzzy, who has stopped breathing;

                         summer. By then, the water will have 
                         rubbed the glass smooth against the 
                         sand--there won't be any sharp edges.

               She finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells 
               at the high-tide mark.

                         from some year before. I put glass 
                         here every year. The ocean makes it 
                         beautiful.

               Candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look 
               at. The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade 
               of green.

               She rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand, then 
               throws it toward the water. It falls short. Homer retrieves 
               it. Candy splashes him playfully. He chases her away from 
               the beach, into the pine trees. Homer locks his arms around 
               her, from behind. He can't let go. She lets him hold her, 
               then breaks his grip. She turns to face him. She is taller 
               then he is, older, obviously more experienced. She initiates 
               the kiss. They drop to the ground right there; they make 
               love by the roots of the tree, Candy guiding him.

               In the newly painted, spruced-up cider house, Homer and Candy 
               are dancing to another slow, sexy song on the radio. He is 
               untucking her blouse, feeling under her blouse--she starts 
               to unbutton his shirt. They kiss while they dance. But the 
               song changes abruptly on the radio to something fast and 
               silly.

               Homer responds to the music, dancing goofily--instantly out 
               of the mood. Candy laughs, but she picks up a pillow and 
               swings it at him, hitting him. He dances away from her. She 
               throws the pillow; he ducks--the pillow lands somewhere near 
               the door. Now Homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed 
               to bed. She shrieks--they're both laughing. They each grab a 
               pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other, laughing 
               all the while, until he pins her arms behind her and, 
               breathing hard--and despite the stupid music that broke the 
               mood--they are passionately kissing again.

               The sound of a truck is sudden and loud.

               Breakfast time at the picnic table. Rose Rose by herself, 
               away from the table. She does not look well; she suddenly 
               goes back inside the bunkhouse.

               When Homer comes in, Rose Rose is throwing up in the sink.

               Rose Rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open. There 
               is something familiar about the way Homer approaches her 
               bedside; he does so with the authority of a doctor. He sits 
               on the edge of her bed with such complete self-assurance 
               that she doesn't protest.

               She just stares. But she doesn't stop him when he touches 
               her abdomen. It's as if she knows that he knows what he's 
               doing.

               There, suddenly, is Mr. Rose, walking past them. He is 
               uncharacteristically tentative.

               Mr. Rose leaves Candy and Rose Rose alone again. Rose Rose 
               nods almost invisibly after her father. Rose Rose looks 
               pointedly at Candy, nodding. Candy slowly gets it. Mr. Rose 
               is the father! Rose Rose lets that sink in; she keeps looking

               By his expression--he looks as if he's been punched--it's 
               clear that Mr. Rose didn't *know that*.

               The other pickers are on their way to lunch; it's obvious 
               that Muddy, Peaches, and Hero already know that Mr. Rose is 
               sleeping with his daughter.

               Rose Rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers 
               arrive for lunch, almost simultaneously with Homer. He looks 
               at, then looks away from, Rose Rose. Mr. Rose is the last to 
               sit down at the table as a very tense, wordless lunch begins.

               Homer is on a ladder picking apples. Muddy climbs a ladder 
               on the other side of the same tree.

                         it.

               Muddy looks all around for Mr. Rose; then he gives Homer his 
               knife.

                         knife to Rose Rose, you hear?

               Homer nods, pocketing the knife. As Muddy climbs down and 
               moves his ladder to an adjacent tree, he keeps talking to 
               Homer until he disappears in the leaves.

               Homer lies awake in his bed.

               The pickers on their ladders in the trees; nobody is talking. 
               In the late sun, the leaves have a reddish, fiery glow.

</b>
               It's much colder; the pickers are on their ladders in the 
               trees again, but they're dressed for the cold. Homer is high 
               on a ladder; he turns toward the view of the Worthington 
               house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the 
               driveway. Homer sees Candy get out of Wally's car; she leaves 
               the door open and runs toward the house. Parked in front of 
               Wally's car is an Army Jeep, with an ENLISTED MAN leaning 
               against it. The indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he 
               watches Candy run.

               Homer descends the ladder and runs for the house, down as 
               aisle between the row of trees. The pickers watch him run.

<b>               INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Camera follows Homer into the Worthington house where, from 
               the front hall, he sees Olive and Candy (in profile) sitting 
               on the couch. We can't see who's talking, nor do we recognize 
               the voice. As Homer comes into the living room, we see MAJOR 
               WINSLOW sitting in a chair (also in profile), talking to 
               Olive and Candy.

               Major Winslow is a smooth, handsome well-briefed officer in 
               the casualty branch of the Army Air Corps; he's done his 
               homework, but he's not all business. He's painfully aware of 
               the delicate nature of his report.

</b>                         When the plane was hit, the crew 
                         chief and the radioman jumped close 
                         together. The copilot jumped third. 
                         All on Captain Worthington's orders--
                         the captain was still flying the 
                         plane. None of the men of the ground 
                         could see the sky--that's how thick 
                         the jungle was. They never saw the 
                         plane crash--they never *heard* it 
                         crash. They never saw Captain 
                         Worthington's parachute, either.

                         hospitalized for almost a week in 
                         China before they were flown back to

                         sorted through their gear...

               Homer is in semidarkness as he walks toward the cider house.

               Homer walks faster. When he gets to the cider house, he sees 
               Mr. Rose and Rose Rose arguing. Rose is sitting on the 
               bicycle, a bundle of her clothes tied up behind the seat.

               starts to struggle.

               Rose Rose and Mr. Rose stop struggling. Suddenly Homer is in 
               charge.

<b>               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Muddy, Hero and Peaches smoke in their beds. Rose Rose opens 
               her curtain and peers out from her bed. She gets up and goes 
               toward the kitchen area in her nightshirt; she stops at an 
               unused bed, now covered with white rubber sheeting--Homer's 
               medical instruments are displayed and ready. Homer finished 
               scrubbing his hands in the sink. His surgical mask is loosely 
               tied around his neck.

               Mr. Rose is looking at Homer's surgical instruments when 
               Rose Rose joins him.

<b>               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Mr. Rose wears a surgical mask; he is sweating, even in the 
               cold, and his eyes look stricken as he watches Homer, who is 
               performing the abortion. Mr. Rose holds the ether cone over 
               Rose Rose's face. He drips some ether from the bottle on the 
               cone.

               Cut quickly for Rose Rose's etherized face... to Mr. Rose's 
               eyes above his mask... to Homer working with his eyes trained 
               on the speculum...

               ...to Muddy and Peaches and Hero huddled under the overhanging 
               roof in the rain.

               Mr. Rose is having a hard time breathing.

               The cider house in the rain. Mr. Rose staggers out; he stands 
               there in the rain, trying to regain his composure. He starts 
               to scream.

               Another angle: huddled under the overhanging roof, Muddy and 
               Peaches and Hero are watching him.

<b>               INT. BUNKHOUSE - RAINY DAY
</b>
               Rose Rose, curled in a fetal position, listens to the rain 
               on the roof. Candy sits on her bed beside her. She helps her 
               to sit up, to drink a glass of water; then Rose Rose lies 
               down again. Rose Rose's expression never changes while Candy 
               talks to her. Mr. Rose lies in his bed in the exact same 
               fetal position as his daughter; he too, is listening to Candy. 
               Homer is putting away his instruments.

                         tomorrow, but it can come back again. 
                         The cramps will ease up, almost 
                         entirely. The bleeding is usually 
                         much lighter in two days. As long as 
                         the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.

               Muddy enters the cider house from out of the storm. He glances 
               at Candy and Rose Rose; then at Homer. Then he speaks to Mr. 
               Rose.

               Hero and Peaches, dripping wet, come inside. Peaches is 
               standing next to the list of rules tacked to the kitchen 
               support beam.

               Rose interjects.

               Candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably, 
               unstoppably. Homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears--
               another "first" for him. He turns and looks at her with an 
               almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at 
               the blank screen.

               The rain has stopped but the grass is wet, the trees 
               glistening in the dawn light as Wally's car stops and Homer 
               gets out. The car exits the frame in one direction; Homer,

               Homer starts jogging, then running toward the cider house. 
               Muddy comes down the ladder to meet him.

               Rose Rose's bed is exposed. The curtains are flung open; her 
               bed is empty. Mr. Rose is still in his bed, in the fetal 
               position we have seen before. Mr. Rose's trancelike expression 
               doesn't change as Homer and Muddy enter.

               Muddy is scared; he looks to Homer for advice.

               Homer takes the blanket off him; Muddy gasps. Homer tries to 
               examine Mr. Rose's wound. Mr. Rose smiles at him.

               Homer finds Mr. Rose's knife. There's blood everywhere.

               Homer and Muddy exchange a glance. Mr. Rose, with his blood-
               soaked hand, suddenly grabs Homer by the throat.

               Mr. Rose dies. Muddy turns away. Homer closes Mr. Rose's 
               eyes.

               Muddy and Hero and Peaches are sitting close together on the 
               roof, like banished children. It is from their perspective 
               that we see the police car and the ambulance--two men carrying 
               the body out of the cider house, and a cop or two talking to 
               Homer and Olive, and Homer talking to them. We hear no 
               dialogue.

               Homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck. 
               The mood is solemn; they work with tired focus. Candy drives 
               up. The men are evasive with her; they find a reason to work 
               across the mart. Candy walks to Homer, stands next to him. 
               They say nothing for a moment, until Candy breaks the silence.

               Candy looks away; she can't think of what to say. She shoves 
               her hands into her pockets, finds a letter there, which she 
               hands to Homer.

               Homer looks at the letter from St. Cloud's; he puts it 
               unopened in his pocket without a second thought. Candy can't 
               let things end there.

               Larch has twisted himself on the narrow bed so that his face 
               is unusually close to the windowsill, and when the ether 
               cone starts to fall off his face--and his slack hand trails 
               down, off the side of the bed--the cone becomes caught against 
               the windowsill.

               He tries to turn his face away from the cone, but he presses 
               his face into the sill--thus holding the ether-soaked cone 
               over his mouth and nose. His hands twitch, he's trying to 
               wake up; the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle 
               fall. The bottle shatters against the sill; the ether spreads, 
               running red with blood from a cut on Dr. Larch's hand or

               Angela enters. She feels for Larch's pulse; Larch is dead. 
               Angela opens a window. She pull's Larch's body away from the 
               windowsill. Buster joins her on the bed.

<b>               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Homer finishes reading the letter; he puts it down, gets up, 
               and walks to a window. He stares into the night.

<b>                                     ANGELA (V.O.)

               Homer wipes a tear off his cheek.

</b>
               The truck is packed for the long trip south; it passes by 
               the packing house, which looks closed for the season. No one 
               else is about. Muddy is driving slowly, his arm out the open 
               window. In the back, huddled among their belongings, are 
               Peaches and Hero (on one side) and Homer (on the other). The 
               pickers are trying to draw Homer into their conversation, 
               while Homer is giving the apple farm a good-bye look. He has 
               made up his mind about something.

               Homer just smiles and shakes his head.

<b>               EXT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MORNING
</b>
               As the pickers' truck drives past, Homer is on the side of 
               the truck nearest the Worthington house and driveway; he 
               sees Olive and Candy and Ray helping Wally out of the car 
               and into a wheelchair. A NURSE stands by.

               Wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's 
               coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge 
               clothes. He can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is 
               drawn into a tight-lipped smile.

                         oranges *naked*, if you want to.

               Olive is dissolved in tears. Candy is sobbing; she kisses 
               Wally, without ceasing, while he haltingly touches her face, 
               her hair.

               In the truck the smile is gone from Homer's face. He shakes 
               his head.

<b>                                     HOMER

               This makes all the pickers laugh, but Homer just smiles and 
               shakes his head. He watches the Worthington house disappear 
               from view.

<b>               INT. MOVING TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT
</b>
               A CONDUCTOR, taking tickets, comes to Homer, who is better 
               dressed than we've ever seen him; he is looking at his sober 
               reflection in the black window-glass of the night train when 
               the conductor gets his attention. When the conductor moves 
               on, Homer takes Angela's letter out of his breast pocket; he 
               skips ahead to the end.

</b>                         Dr. Larch often wondered how the

                         were up to.

               Angela and Buster and Mary Agnes and Edna carry Larch's 
               coffin; they set it down by the raw hole. The pile of fresh 
               dirt stands out against the new snow; the hole is black 
               against the new white.

               We see the faces of the girls praying for Larch (Mary Agnes, 
               too) as Edna finishes her favorite prayer.

</b>
               The train stops, blowing snow. Homer steps off the train 
               carrying a suitcase and Dr. Larch's bag. The disapproving 
               stationmaster is still disapproving. Music plays Over, 
               something triumphant.

<b>               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - THE HILL - EARLY MORNING

               Homer makes his way up the hill toward the orphanage. Music 
               Over.

<b>               EXT. ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
               Edna is breaking up fights; this time, instead of fighting 
               over snowballs, the orphans are fighting over their pumpkins. 
               Suddenly Homer tops the brow of the hill and they all see 
               him. Buster is the first to catch sight of Homer; he runs 
               toward him. Mary Agnes also sees Homer; she immediately turns 
               away and runs inside. Music FADES OUT Over.

<b>               INT. LAVATORY - EARLY MORNING

               Mary Agnes crashes into the bathroom and stumbles up to the 
               mirror; she starts to fix herself up with shaking hands.

<b>               INT. ORPHANAGE, FRONT HALL - EARLY MORNING
</b>
               Everyone has heard the news; they come on the run. The 
               children flock around Homer, hugging him. Homer takes Angela 
               and Edna in his arms. Mary Agnes joins the group. Homer takes 
               in how changed, how attractive she is. They smile awkwardly 
               at each other.

<b>               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - EVENING
</b>
               Homer's suitcase is open on the bed; we see Homer's hands as 
               he begins to unpack. Smaller hands reach in and root through 
               the clothes.

               Curly continues his search. Homer thinks for a second; then 
               reaches into his pocket and pulls out the piece of pale-green 
               glass.

               Curly is duly impressed; he walks away to examine his new 
               treasure. Homer continues unpacking. He pulls his X ray out 
               and puts it aside.

               Homer turns to see Buster, Mary Agnes, Angela, and Edna in 
               the doorway.

               Angela and Mary Agnes start to put Homer's things back in 
               his bag. Edna picks up the X ray and looks at it with a somber 
               expression.

                         it. That's why he told you it was 
                         yours.

               Homer is stunned; he puts his hand to his heart.

</b>                         I think he worried about his own 
                         heart. He said it would never stand 
                         up to Homer Wells going off to war.

               Homer takes that in; he nods. Mary Agnes touches him 
               sympathetically.

<b>               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
               Homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and 
               hanging on the office wall. Homer surveys the office, as if 
               for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if 
               slowly getting used to his new position.

<b>               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT
</b>
               Homer reads to the boys from "David Copperfield". While his 
               voice is strong--positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring 
               to the boys--there is in the conclusion of the chapter 
               something that distracts him. He seems to hesitate; he misses 
               a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two 
               others. (Possibly Homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of 
               the next chapter: "I Make Another Beginning.")

<b>                                     HOMER

               Homer stops and looks at the boys' faces.

                         give the story away.

               Homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar 
               semi-darkness. Seconds, later, the closed door to the hall 
               is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall, 
               and Homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and 
               looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation 
               of Larch's popular blessing.

               On Copperfield and Steerforth and Curly as the door to the 
               hall is closed and semi-darkness prevails in the room again. 
               Copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes. After a second, the 
               wide-eyed Steerforth shuts his eyes, too. Then Curly.

               The last to close his eyes is Buster.
