               JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript 
               subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen 
               years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces 
               and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object 
               of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned 
               curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking 
               leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless 
               latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.

               FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He's 
               sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers 
               herself onto his lap.

               A 60's Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player.

               A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality.

                         for a second, okay?

               We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away 
               from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again.

</b>                         This is the most magnificent discarded 
                         living room set I've ever seen.

               She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and 
               wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.

               Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a 
               jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of 
               juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly 
               on a mission.

<b>               EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY
</b>
               Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the 
               main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.

               The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed 
               serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container 
               over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS 
               with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.

               She enters the DRUGSTORE.

<b>               INT. DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from 
               behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest.

</b>                         I think the last one was defective. 
                         The plus sign looked more like a 
                         division sign.

               Rollo regards her with intense skepticism.

</b>                         I remain unconvinced.

               Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach.

                         about it!

               An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and 
               lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle.

</b>                         Three times? Oh girl, you are way 
                         pregnant. It's easy to tell. Is your 
                         nipples real brown?

               A pile of stolen COSMETICS falls out of the girl's jacket 
               and clatters to the floor.

</b>                         Balls!

               Juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly, hopping. It's 
               obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently.

<b>                                     ROLLO

               Rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down 
               one of the aisles.

                         their unplanned pregnancies and their

<b>               INT. DRUGSTORE - BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
               In the dim, reeking public bathroom, Juno hovers over the 
               commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles. She clumsily 
               tries to use the pregnancy test.

               We see the test box sitting on the sink. It's a TeenWave 
               Discount Pregnancy Test. The accompanying outdated package 
               photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression. 
               The fine print on the box reads "From the makers of Sun-Glitz 
               Lightening Hair Spritz!"

<b>               INT. DRUGSTORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY
</b>
               Juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the 
               open test box on the front counter. Rollo scans it and bags 
               it indifferently.

               She places a giant licorice Super Rope on the counter.

                         Myrtle? Minus or plus?

                         pink plus sign again. God, it's 
                         unholy.

               She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the 
               results. Shake. Shake. Nothing.

               Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, 
               gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super 
               Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to 
               fashion a noose.

               Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of 
               prairie grass and wild flowers.

               PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for 
               early morning track practice. He wears a cross country uniform

               Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting 
               for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the

               Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening

               He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep 
               yearbook.

               We see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white 
               YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten 
               message from Juno. We hear Juno's voice reading the message:

               Bleeker's mom gives up and closes the door.

                         are you?

</b>                         Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the 
                         doctor yesterday and they said I was 
                         twelve weeks.

               Vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray.

</b>                         Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost 
                         into your second trimester, then?

</b>                         Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on 
                         May 4.

                         you. I mean, my girlfriends always 
                         tell me the first couple months are 
                         the hardest.

</b>                         Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm 
                         more worried about the part where I 
                         have to start wearing jeans with an 
                         elastic panel in the front.

                         So, let's discuss how we're gonna do 
                         this... thing.

                         it to you, right?

</b>                         Mark and Vanessa are willing to 
                         negotiate an open adoption.

</b>                         It means they'd send annual updates, 
                         photos, let Juno know how the baby 
                         is doing as he or she grows up. Of 
                         course, Juno's legal rights would be 
                         terminated...

                         I don't need to be notified of 
                         anything. Can't we just kick it old 
                         school? I could just put the baby in 
                         a basket and send it your way. You 
                         know, like Moses in the reeds.

                         it Old Testament.

               Mark and Juno lock eyes.

                         do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping

</b>                         Well, then we agree a traditional 
                         closed adoption would be best for 
                         all involved, then?

                         the baby. I just want it to grow up 
                         with people who are ready to love it 
                         and be parents. I'm in high school,

               Mark is caught off guard.

</b>                         Sure, why not? I mean, every guy 
                         wants to be a father. Coach soccer,

                         don't know. Fatherly stuff.

               Mac casts a subtle, dubious glance at Mark.

                         the paperwork? Gerta has already 
                         drafted some preliminary documents.

                         being re-tiled, but you can use the 
                         master bath upstairs. Go up, then

               Juno heads into the foyer and up the stairs. We see a posed 
               photo of Mark and Vanessa in the stairwell. Their house is 
               beautiful, but frigid. Juno rubs her arms, shivering.

</b>
               The Loring's bathroom is huge. Juno flushes and goes to the 
               double sink to wash her hands. She opens the overhead cabinet 
               and sees Vanessa's toiletries. She spritzes on some perfume 
               and examines the more expensive grooming items. There's a 
               crinkled tube of LUBE in the cabinet. Juno picks it up, 
               fascinated. She rubs a drop of it between her hands and runs 
               it through her hair like pomade.

               Mark grabs the STEREO REMOTE off the kitchen counter and 
               turns up the volume to a roar. Mark and Juno stand in silence 
               in the kitchen. Mark mouths along with the lyrics.

               He gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch.

               Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling 
               CD's. He's got a Carpenter's disc, the "No Alternative" 
               charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone.

               Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up.

                         Right. Well, Juno, your parents must 
                         be wondering where you are. You might 
                         want to head home.

                         figure nothing worse could happen to 
                         me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was

               Juno parks her PREVIA on the street. She walks up to the

               BLEEKER'S MOM answers, visibly annoyed. Her eyes drift down 
               to Juno's middle.

               She steals another glance at Juno's belly.

               Bleeker's mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and down 
               the hallway to Paulie's bedroom. Juno discreetly tries to 
               charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her 
               from getting past Bleeker's mom. They share an extremely 
               awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway.

               Bleecker's mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker's 
               bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration 
               hanging on it that says PAULIE'S VRROOOM! It looks like 
               something a 5-year old might have.

               Paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studying

               bedroom door. Juno appears. Paulie jumps, startled.

               She closes the door halfway and leaves. Juno rolls her eyes 
               and pulls the door shut entirely.

               pours them into his mouth.

               The song playing ends, and another one begins. It's "the

               Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of 
               actual maternity wear. Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel.

               Juno drags Leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind

               discuss their outfits for an upcoming party.

               One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa's sleeve. 
               Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play

               them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children.

               He and Juno smile conspiratorially.

               He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.

</b>
               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and 
               unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain 
               to illuminate a bare bulb.

               Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.

                         Here it is.

               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." 
               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking 
               names.

                         me of you.

               Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble 
               her.

                         condition.

               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!

               Juno is sincerely pleased.

</b>                         Okay, how about some tunes?

               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno 
               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.

                         still totally rad and hardcore.

               Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.

                         was a good dance partner. Even let 
                         me put my hands on her butt.

                         dancing like a dork!

               She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves 
               back and forth stiffly.

                         Then you put your arms around my 
                         neck. That's how we did it in '88.

               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 
               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.

               They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against 
               Mark.

               They laugh.

               Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence 
               for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close 
               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.

               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.

               Juno looks totally betrayed. She doesn't respond. Vanessa

                         just has cold feet. That's how boys

               We hear the front door closing. Vanessa and Mark look over 
               and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict.

<b>               EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON

               Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys, 
               but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.

<b>               EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON
</b>
               The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the 
               shoulder.

<b>               INT. PREVIA - AFTERNOON
</b>
               Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for 
               the first time since she became pregnant.

               After a beat, she begins to gather herself.

<b>               INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar. 
               He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise.

<b>               EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT
</b>
               Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. 
               We push in close... when she gets an idea.

               She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she 
               finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and 
               pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?

<b>               EXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT

               It's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting 
               alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of 
               wine.

<b>               INT. LORING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events

               her.

               Mark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting 
               on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the 
               van.

               Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute 
               because of Juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami." He 
               holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back.

               Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, 
               examining it.

               Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's 
               been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.

                         different for a while.

               She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch 
               and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly 
               with it. Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.

                         can do is to find a person who loves 
                         you for exactly what you are. Good 
                         mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, 
                         handsome, what have you, the right 
                         person will still think that the sun 
                         shines out your ass. That's the kind 
                         of person that's worth sticking with.

               A wave of REALIZATION crosses Juno's face.

               We push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the 
               window. We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah

               Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning 
               run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the 
               stoop: "BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL."

               He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch 
               on the mailbox.

               At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come 
               pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the 
               driveway. Bleeker smiles.

               In the distance, near the school entrance, we see STEVE 
               RENDAZO (the kid who always TORMENTS Juno) regarding the 
               makeout session with a sad, envious expression.

               LEAH passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the 
               fence, rolling her eyes.

               She's more pregnant than we've ever seen her. She revs a 
               Matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll.

               Bren appears behind them and orders Juno out of the 
               wheelchair, exasperated. She pulls off Juno's surgical cap.

               Bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat.

               Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno.

               She's not there.

               Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without 
               stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused.

               A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and 
               gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.

               The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.

               Pull back to reveal she's speaking to VANESSA, who stands, 
               paralyzed, several feet away.

                         time getting out.

               Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in 
               her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him.

               She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren 
               leaning against the doorway.

               Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY
</b>
               Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth 
               is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and 
               accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared 
               out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's 
               not sure what to say.

               He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game, 
               but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His 
               expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.

                         On your terms.

               Juno nods and swallows.

               Over Mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway. 
               It's Bleeker in his track uniform.

               Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac glances 
               at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac clears his 
               throat, gets up and leaves the room.

               Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his 
               arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for 
               the first time in months.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING
</b>
               Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared 
               to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and 
               swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track 
               uniform and spikes.

<b>                                     JUNO (V.O.)
</b>                         Bleeker decided he didn't want to 
                         see the baby. Neither did I, really. 
                         He didn't feel like ours.

<b>               INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING
</b>
               We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her 
               eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently.

<b>                                     JUNO (V.O.)
</b>                         I think he was always hers.

<b>               INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY
</b>
               The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate 
               taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the 
               antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.

<b>                                     JUNO (V.O.)
</b>                         It ended with a chair.

               We pan past the wall Vanessa had said "needed something." 
               There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was 
               handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it 
               says: "Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno."

               We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We 
               see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her 
               shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa 
               looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There 
               are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed 
               close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the 
               baby for a single moment.

               The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows 
               with an expression of pure bliss.

<b>               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle 
               out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who 
               is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost 
               as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.

<b>               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY
</b>
               Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar 
               is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not 
               pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.

</b>                         As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is 
                         totally boss. He is the cheese to my 
                         macaroni. I know people are supposed 
                         to fall in love before they reproduce, 
                         but normalcy's not really our style.

               As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she 
               passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in 
               outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.

               Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning 
               his guitar.

<b>               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles 
               and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and 
               pulls the pick out of the strings.

               Bleeker nods.

               Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "Anyone Else 
               But You," by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first 
               their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.

               She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile 
               ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.

               Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with
