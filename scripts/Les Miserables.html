               The year is 1815.                                         

               The French revolution is a distant                        
               memory. Napoleon has been defeated.                       
               France is ruled by a King again.

     RISE UP out of the iron-grey surface of the ocean, seething         
     in the wind, towards the shore. Winter rain slices the air.         
     Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest        
     of tall masted warships.                                            

     The great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their            
     rigging.                                                            

     Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships             
     under construction, and warships being refitted.

</b>
     Storm-lashed sea and driving rain. A great wave rises up
     and hammers down. As it recedes we see the figures of men
     heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over           
     their faces. The harsh storm light catches glints of metal:
     these men are CONVICTS, chained by manacles, heads shaved,          
     wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched             
     onto them.                                                          

     Now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being            
     hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war, its masts
     broken, rising and falling on the surge.

     As yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we
     follow the straining ropes down into the base of the                
     slipway, and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN, up to his waist         
     in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and          
     spray and wind scream round him. A great brute of a man, he         
     seems to feel nothing.

The convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the
rope -

The camera RISES UP to find JAVERT, the officer in charge       
of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed      
and expressionless. He stands above the men on the top of
the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the
steep steps of the dock wall.

Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of   
half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in   
the mist.                                                       

FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is
almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.

With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the            
damaged ship onto the slipway.                                    

CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust     
of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean.     
Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent             
command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he     
drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the        
great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks      
water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the      
mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.                  

Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the
chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm
is passing now, blown by the driving wind.

Javert approaches Jean Valjean.

He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper.

</b>
    He strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're
    marched away. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in            
    that he is free at last.

    The convicts sing as he goes.

</b>
    Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on
    his back. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and
    there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide
    vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the
    distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and
    below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. As we hear the
    musical theme ('Freedom is Mine'), we see for the first
    time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope.

     coat close round him against the cold winter wind.

     He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches

     Valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains.
     Snow on the ground here, and darkness falling.

     He looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff,
     its lights twinkling, the snowy mountains rising behind.
     The tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of

     Valjean sits in the corner, his hat low over his head. He
     eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast
     meal by a roaring fire place. The innkeeper serves him a
     beer. As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to
     reveal his wrist, calloused and scarred by manacles. The
     innkeeper eyes him warily. He discusses Valjean with two
     other men, then asks for his paper. Sees the phrase
     "Extremely Dangerous".

     hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of
     refusal.

     Valjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes
     down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways,
     but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure
     follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'.

     Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a
     stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his
     heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife
     before him, his children on either side. Nothing special,
     and yet everything he's never had.

     He stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell
     hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open.

     The grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some
     children who have been following begin throwing stones at
     him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter.

     He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret.         
     Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some            
     straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an
     enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel.

     Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry,
     weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from
     where the dog has bitten him.

     At the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a
     dark churchyard.

     Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean
     collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the
     shelter of a doorway.                                               

     A lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches,
     throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest
     on the crumpled figure of Valjean.

     He stirs and opens his eyes.

     VALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness.
     Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The            
<b>     BISHOP.

               Though our lives are very humble
               What we have we have to share.

     Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes
     with the Bishop into the house by the church.

     A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with          
     silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room,           
     illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop      
     ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's         
     sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates.

     The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair.

     Valjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him.
     Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a

     The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are
     also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage,
     Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom.
     There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a
     cupboard.

     He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen
     waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his
     life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him.

<b>                         BISHOP

               before you leave you will have a
               cup of milk from our cows, nice
               and hot.

     The Bishop turns away to go to sleep.

<b>                         VALJEAN
</b>               You let me sleep here next to you?
               How do you know I'm not a murderer?

     Valjean laughs a strange laugh.

</b>               God will take care of that.

<b>     LATER THAT NIGHT -
</b>
     Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep.

     Outside a dog barks.

     Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the
     light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down
     on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing
     judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and
     remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door.

     There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to
     the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop
     lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver
     is kept.

     Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a             
     metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor           
     boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his
     breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep.
     He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard          
     door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop,                  
     disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is
     over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should          
     he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and
     lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown.
     He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is
     the silver.
<b>                                                          10.
</b>

     Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last         
     look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the
     door.

     Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He                
     crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's         
     gone.

     The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments          
     when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean
     before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the
     Bishop's eyes.

<b>                         CONSTABLE

               say you gave him all this!

     He upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out.

     The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean.

<b>                         BISHOP
</b>               That is right.

     Amazed, Valjean looks up.

<b>                         BISHOP
</b>               But my friend, you left so early,
               You forgot I gave these also.
               Would you leave the best behind?

     The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks.

<b>                         BISHOP

               Now God's blessing go with you.

     Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn
     and leave.

     Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks.

     He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it.                

     He turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it.

               My life was a war that could
               never be won.

     Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office
     above with a pitiful cry.

     Valjean hears the cry, but he has other concerns. He turns
     round to face Javert.                                               

     Javert stares at him.

     On the factory floor below, the Foreman hustles Fantine
     out, as she struggles against him.

     Javert turns to look through the high window onto the men's         
     factory floor below. The last men are leaving for the day.

     Javert is puzzled. He's sure he recognises Valjean, but
     from where?

<b>                           JAVERT
</b>                 It seems to me

     A CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts -


<b>24   EXT. TRACK LEADING TO FACTORY, MONTREUIL - DAY               24
</b>
     Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and
     down the muddy track beyond to discover -

     A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver -             
     Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a
     crate.

     The   cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart
     off   the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is
     too   soft. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in
     the   mud.

     Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help,
     but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground.
     All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing
     Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him.
     Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart
     have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws
     himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces
     himself to lift it from beneath.

<b>                           VALJEAN
</b>                 Get back! It may fall!

<b>                           FOREMAN

</b>

Javert stands back and looks on. As he looks, we see a
memory stirring in him.

JAVERT'S POV - Valjean's posture beneath the cart is
exactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast.
The same crouching power. The same almost-suicidal
determination.

Valjean sees Javert looking at him, and knows exactly what
he's thinking. For a moment he hesitates. Then he hears
Fauchelevent's choking scream as the mud gags his mouth.
Valjean strains every muscle, and slowly one end of the
cart begins to rise. As soon as it clears the crushed and
gasping man, the others pull him clear.

Valjean lets the cart down again, and climbs out. As he
brushes himself down he finds Javert staring at him.

<b>                    JAVERT

          He disappeared.                                      

He shakes his head, realising how absurd his suspicions
are.

<b>                    JAVERT

          I would not dare -

          Don't leave it there.

Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more.      
Javert is not yet confident enough to continue.                

Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent.

     He draws himself up and gives a bow. As he walks away, he            
     discusses something with his assistant.

     alleyway that runs down to   the harbour and three ships lying       
     on the mud at low tide. At   the far end, the largest is the         
     rotting hulk of a vast old   warship. A single whore sits in a

     Drunken sailors spill out into the alleyway below. The               
     first sailor is trying to find the whorehouse.

               In that harbour over there!

     They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore. Fantine presses   
     on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors.

A man with no legs, reacting to the sailors, cranks up an

harbour whores appear and tout for business.

She approaches Fantine, reaching out to stroke her hair.

               So different now from what it
               seemed!
               Now life has killed the dream I
               dreamed.

     As she ends her song, her next customer is waiting. The head      
     whore beyond.                                                     


<b>29   EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT                 29
</b>
     Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside,              
     shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly,
     but still attempts an alluring smile.

     She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits,
     trying pathetically to attract custom. Then she comes to a
     stop, staring. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some
     way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to       
     a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money.           

     As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-
     dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives        
     with two friends and a valet.                                     
<b>                                                     30.

<b>                    BAMATABOIS
</b>          Here's something new. I think
          I'll give it a try.
          Come closer, you! I like to see
          what I buy.
          The usual price
          For just one slice of your pie.                       

<b>                    FANTINE
</b>          I don't want you! No! No,
          M'sieur! Let me go!

<b>                    BAMATABOIS
</b>          Is this a trick? I won't pay
          more!

<b>                    FANTINE
</b>          No, not at all!                                       

<b>                    BAMATABOIS
</b>          You've got some nerve, you little
          slut!
          You've got some gall!                                 
          It's the same with a tart as it is                    
          with a grocer                                         
          The customer sees what he gets in                     
          advance                                               
          It's not for the whore to say "yes                    
          sir" or "no sir"                                      
          It's not for the harlot to pick and                   
          to choose or to lead me a dance!                      

He pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down      
her cleavage. Fantine reacts with fury. They fall over in the   
snow and Bamatabois laughs.                                     

<b>                    FANTINE
</b>          I'll kill you, you bastard!
          Try any of that!
          Even a whore who has gone to the
          bad
          Won't be had by a rat!                                

Fantine scratches Bamatabois across the face. Bamatabois        
touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. His         
friends drag Fantine against the harbour wall.                  

<b>                    BAMATABOIS
</b>              (furious but aroused)                             
          By Christ you'll pay for what
          you've done!
          This rat will make you bleed,
          you'll see!
          I guarantee I'll make you suffer!

          For this insult to life and
          property!
<b>                                                     31.
</b>

Bamatabois suddenly sees that police have arrived.            

<b>                    FANTINE
</b>          I beg you, don't report me, sir.
          I'll do whatever you may want.                      

<b>                    BAMATABOIS
</b>          Make your excuse to the police!

Bamatabois' friend drags Fantine towards the police. It's     
Javert.

<b>                    JAVERT
</b>          Tell me quickly what's the story.
          Who saw what and why and where?

          Let him answer to Javert!
          In this nest of whores and vipers
          Let one speak who saw it all.
          Who laid hands on this good man
          here?
          What's the substance of this
          brawl?

<b>                    BAMATABOIS
</b>          Javert, would you believe it?                       
          I was walking, it was dark
          When this prostitute attacked me
          You can see she's left her mark!

He shows the blood. Javert turns to Fantine.

<b>                    JAVERT
</b>          She will answer for her actions
          When you make a full report.
          You may rest assured, M'sieur,
          That she will answer to the
          court.

Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with
occasional spasms of coughing. Unseen by her, Valjean is
approaching from behind. Javert's assistants pick Fantine     
up. Javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he         
approaches Fantine.                                           

<b>                    FANTINE

          me,

          high.
          Holy God, is there no mercy?
          If I go to jail she'll die.                         

<b>                    JAVERT
</b>          I have heard such protestations
          Every day for twenty years.

          Save your breath and save your
          tears.

Javert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away.     

Valjean steps out of the shadows.

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          A moment of your time, Javert.
          I do believe this woman's tale.

</b>          Monsieur le Mayor!                                    

Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches
out a hand to Fantine. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to
her in a dream -

<b>                    FANTINE
</b>          Can this be?

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          Where will she end -
          This child without a friend?

He holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face.

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          I've seen your face before.
          Show me some way to help you.

          In such a place as this?

          away.
          Yes, you were there
          And turned aside.
          I never did no wrong.

<b>                    FANTINE

     Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms.                             

     Javert is quietly coldly furious.

     As Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them,       
     then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow          
     after them.

     As Javert walks up the steps to his police station his            
     assistant stops him with an urgent letter.

     expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a
     terrible mistake.

     Valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his
     papers once everyone else has gone, when Javert enters and          
     stands before him. He looks up.

<b>                         JAVERT
</b>               I mistook you for a convict,

      commanding hand, to indicate his decision is made. Javert
      gives an abrupt bow, and departs.

      Left alone, Valjean paces his office, deeply disturbed.

      Close on two horses panting. A stopped carriage in a wide

      The man accused of being Jean Valjean, a wretched down-and-
      out, stands before the JUDGE. He looks uncannily like the            
      real Valjean. Before the judge has a chance to speak, the            
      doors open and Valjean bursts in. Sensation in the court.

     The judge is too stunned to respond. The others in the

     The hospital is in the long attic of Valjean's factory.             

     Valjean hurries into the hospital, breathless. He sees a

Fantine has stopped looking towards the window. All her
fading strength is now directed towards Valjean. She tries
to reach up to him.

Fantine starts to spasm. She sees something over Valjean's      
shoulder. Valjean doesn't realise. Her eyes go glassy as        
she passes away. Valjean then hears the unforgettable voice

Javert disarms Valjean and drives him backwards towards an

     grimy rag - this is her "doll", the knot is the doll's head.        

               There is a lady all in white
               Holds me and sings a lullaby.
               She's nice to see and she's soft to
               touch

               She says, Cosette, I love you
               very much.

               lost
               I know   a place where no one

     Madame Thenardier comes bustling down the stairs in a bad           
     mood. She glowers at little Cosette and changes the closed          
     sign from "closed" to "open".

          that!

Madame Thenardier sees that Cosette far from going is             
hiding behind the far wall. We see Cosette's frightened           
eyes peering out from a tiny gap in this wall.

The innkeeper's gang posing as customers who have been            
loitering outside come in, explaining to a fifth man who is a

Thenardier goes outside to open up the rather pathetic frost

        Cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood, and
        is now heading back. Through the dark trees ahead we glimpse
        the cheerful lights of the Frost Fair and the distant inn.
        She goes slowly, because the buckets are heavy. She hums to
        herself to keep her spirits up, a wordless verse of `Castle
        on a Cloud'.

        After a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the
        buckets.

        Strong arms reach for the buckets and lift them out of her
        hands. She looks up, amazed. There's Valjean.

                I'm so afraid of failing you
                Just a child who cannot know
                That danger follows where I go
                There are shadows everywhere
                And memories I cannot share

                Nevermore alone
                Nevermore apart
                You have warmed my heart
                Like the sun.
                You have brought the gift of life
                And love so long denied me.

                Suddenly I see
                What I could not see
                Something suddenly
                Has begun.

      He brushes the hair from her face, and satisfies himself
      that she's comfortable. Then he puts his head out of the
      window. At the gate into Paris, soldiers are checking              
      documents of occupants of carriages.                               

      Valjean slips out of the carriage with Cosette and makes           
      his way along the wall, away from the gate.

      Valjean and Cosette turn down a narrow street, no longer           
      hurrying.                                                          

      The narrow street turns, and opens out onto the river.             
      Valjean stops. There, on the other side of the river, in the       
      light of a lamp, stands Javert.

     Now Valjean and Cosette are running - down narrow alleys,
     into small dark courtyards, not knowing which way to turn.
     Whenever Valjean thinks they've thrown their pursuer, there
     he is, not far behind. And he's no longer alone. With him
     are a detachment of soldiers.                                     

     Javert and his team never seem to run. But he's always            
     there.


<b>49   EXT. DEAD END - NIGHT                                      49
</b>
     Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by
     high windowless houses. They follow it round a corner to
     find - a dead end. A high wall before them. They're
     trapped.

     Valjean looks round. No way out. Then he sees a nearby lamp
     bracket. Hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower
     the oil lamp for lighting. He tears off the rope and ties
     one end round Cosette, beneath her armpits. Then holding
     the other end, he scales the wall, using the corner to
     brace himself as he rises. Once on the top, he hauls
     Cosette up by the rope. Only then does he turn to look down
     onto the other side.

     A cloister. A building in the middle, windows glowing.
     Grave stones black against the white snow. The sound of
     women's voices, singing a psalm.

     Valjean lowers Cosette down into the garden, and drops down
     after her.

     Javert and his men enter the dead end to find them gone.


<b>50   INT. CONVENT CLOISTER - NIGHT                              50
</b>
     Valjean crouched low, with Cosette in his arms, holding her
     still and quiet until Javert is gone.

     Then he straightens up and looks round. He takes in the
     sound of singing.

He goes closer to the windows of the building. Through the
blurry glass he can make out a chapel, and a line of nuns
singing.

Valjean continues and sees a man filling in a new grave.
The man starts as he sees Valjean.

<b>                    FAUCHELEVENT
</b>          Who's that?

Valjean jumps, takes Cosette protectively into his arms.
Turns to answer.

</b>          Why, it's Monsieur Mayor!

It's Fauchelevent, now a gardener, still limping from his
injury.

Valjean gazes at him, and remembers.

</b>          Now you can do the same for me.
          We need a place of sanctuary.

     Valjean looks to the heavens. The camera soars into the air
     and heads east as dawn breaks over Paris. We rush low over
     Paris as the sun comes up, towards the Place de la Bastille.

<b>     SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:

               Nine years later

     The dawn light glows on a massive ELEPHANT. The monument,
     made of wood and plaster, now ruined and crumbling, stands
     on a plinth on one side of the wide open square. On the far
     side, the remains of the great fortress that was the
     Bastille. In the middle, scaffolding surrounds a half-built
     triumphal column, which is being erected to celebrate the
     new regime.

<b>     SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
</b>
               Paris, 1832.

     The streets that run from the square lead in one direction
     to the Paris of power and wealth; in the other direction
     into the slums.

     The camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant.

     A head pops out of one of the elephant's many holes -
     GAVROCHE, a street urchin. He gives a shrill whistle. At
     once a dozen more street urchins show themselves, from
     every crack in the monument's skin. Agile as a monkey,
     Gavroche drops to the ground, followed by his band.

     dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars,
     weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to
     make their way in either direction. These are the
     conveyances of the rich, fine gilded coaches with matched
     horses and footmen on the back. Virtually at a standstill,
     they lend Gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to
     coach, a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite.

     As he goes, the poor on the pavements sing to the stony-
     faced rich in their golden high-sprung glory -

Gavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of

     The carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a         
     crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of       
     sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch       
     what is going on. The street is padded with straw. Many eyes      
     gaze up at the draped windows. People cross themselves. A

     Through a crack in a door, we see Marius sitting on a tatty          
     mattress in a tiny hovel of a room. He is taking out a               
     hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His         
     eye is caught by the ring on his finger.

     Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius.

<b>55   EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - END OF DAY                       55     
</b>
     Marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau         
     Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes Marius sees          
     two people in the street outside. One is an old gentleman,          
     Valjean. The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The          
     two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from               
     evening church service.                                             

     Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen
     anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental
     foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'.

     As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets
     his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he
     already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held              
     gaze.                                                               

     Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back,         
     at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again.                  

     Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her
     jealously from this distant boy's gaze.                             

     We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the             
     Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's           
     approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon,                  
     Clacquesous, Montparnasse.

     Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth          
     of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sat on the               
     ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps            
     behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius.

As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier she          
recognizes him.

<b>                    THENARDIER
</b>          You know me! I know you!
          And you'll pay what I'm due.

He signals to his gang. A door opens in the alleyway            
revealing the huge Brujon. The gang move in on Valjean          
menacingly.

does Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus.

<b>                    JAVERT

Thenardier, listening, hears this all with great interest.
So Valjean is a crook like him.

        WIDE of the Police Headquarters on the Isle de la Cite: a           
        huge bureaucracy. The camera finds Javert standing inside           
        looking out of a door leading onto the roof. As he sings            
        he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the          
        HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights
        reflected in the river below. Then up at the great city.
        Javert too has a God, and this is his prayer.

Cosette has been talking to someone. He looks pensive.

Valjean returns inside.                                         

Cosette has dropped a keepsake through the gate. Marius picks   
it up.                                                          

Marius makes his way back down the street, filled with          
thoughts of his love. Completely forgetting Eponine is there.   

Shadows move up the street from the other direction. It's       
Thenardier and his gang. They gather at the wrought-iron
gate.

     We pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at         
     the first floor window with the students beyond them to see         
     that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the

     All is still. Then comes the soft beating of draped drums.
     The tramp of feet.

     All down the streets, waiting, the silent faces of the
     poor. Among them we see Enjolras, Marius, and the radical
     students.

Police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds.        

Now into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL
PROCESSION. An entire battalion of infantry, marching with
weapons reversed. A column of black-suited dignitaries
carrying branches of laurel. A division of Cavalry rides in      
front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a          
military tatoo.                                                  

INTO FRAME comes a team of black horses stepping slowly,         
black plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage         
draped in the tricolour flag. On the carriage stands a

Softly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin        
to sing.

          Singing the song of angry men?

          Who will not be slaves again!

The police and guardsmen look round to see who is singing
so subversively, but they can't be sure where it's coming
from. The singing grows stronger.

The dignitaries become aware of the singing, and glance
uneasily from side to side.

As the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students,     
Enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses drawing       
the carriage and waves the red flag, stopping the horses and     
the procession.

with passion.

Enjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd have now
become the procession. They turn off the main street away      
from the expected course of the funeral procession.            
Gavroche's elephant looms over this side street. Gavroche      
and his gang jump down from the elephant to join in.           

As the procession turns off, the calvary division gallop       
ahead and disappear round a corner.

     The students and crowd come face to face with the calvary. On   
     one side, muskets of the infantry poke through the broken       
     down fence surrounding the elephant. Other infantry have        
     taken up position in a cafe opposite, upending tables to        
     provide cover.                                                  

     There is a tense, prolonged silence. Then suddenly one              
     nervous SOLDIER lets off a round. It hits a middle aged             
     kindly looking WOMAN CITIZEN in the crowd around the coffin         
     carriage. The crowd is furious. Students charge the soldier,        
     grab his musket and knock him down with the hilt of the gun.        

     More shots ring out. The cavalry charges. The funeral               
     explodes into a riot. The people of Paris turn on the
     dragoons, the National Guards, the police. More squadrons
     of dragoons charge into the crowd, sabres unsheathed. Women
     run screaming in terror.

     Some students fire weapons into the air, some into the              
     cavalry and at the infantry. Enjolras knocks a calvary              
     officer off his horse and Marius jumps on the horse.                

     The students break away and race off through the cafe into          
     a side street where citizens begin to erect a barricade. A          
     cavalry rider gives chase and is shot by one of the                 
     students and falls through the window of an upended

     FOLLOW the students as they burst into their home street.           
     They have been joined by a motley collection of citizens            
     including burghers and an old eccentric man FATHER MABEUF           
     who works as hard as anyone. They raid a fencing shop and a

     husbands' muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution           
     on their front doors, they encourage homeowners to                  
     contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to         
     help overcome any reluctance. Soon the street is raining            
     tables, chairs, mattresses, sofas. They smash streetlamps.          
     They set to work to build their barricade. Students                 
     commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the               
     barricade's heart. Three students arrive in the street              
     hauling an uprooted tree.

They pull up paving stones, rip boards, timbers and front       
doors from house and shop-fronts, pull down buttresses, and     
raid the Cafe Musain, systematically stripping it of every      
item of furniture despite the lamentations and                  
protestations of Madame Hucheloup and her barmaid.              

As the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor     
of the cafe the rifles and ammunition they've gathered, to      
prepare to defend their chosen ground. A student stands on      
a stone post distributing weapons. They line the first and      
second floor front rooms with paving stones to create           
protected shooting positions. The inside of the barricade       
is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones. The      
outside is a crazy knarled mess.

barricade,. He wears the insignia of the rebels, and keeps      
his head down.

      twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can        
      be wheeled open to allow access. Two smaller barricades

      climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his              
      little army. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame            
      Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing         
      armchair - and adds it to the barricade. As the men sing

barricade.

</b>          Good evening, dear Inspector.
          Lovely evening, my dear!
          I know this man, my friends.
          His name's Inspector Javert!
          So don't believe a word he says
          Cause none of it's true.
          This only goes to show
          What little people can do.                            

Guns swing round to aim at Javert. He stares back in
defiance.

Gavroche comes dancing down the barricade to Courfeyrac's       
delighted embrace.

Gavroche grabs Grantaire's red cap and puts it on his own
head, mimicking the students.

<b>                     PROUVAIRE
</b>           So what are we going to do
           With this snake in the grass?


Enjolras faces Javert.

<b>                     ENJOLRAS

Javert is led into the cafe. As they pass through the front       
door only one student is holding Javert. Seizing his              
opportunity, Javert breaks free and the students have to          
subdue him by force. Javert is on his knees and is being tied     
to the staircase.

Silence.                                                          

Suddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at
the barricade here an ominous distant sound. The sound of
marching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. First
soft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer.
Boots on cobbles. The sound comes right into the end of the
street.

Enjolras and all the students man the main barricade.             

Silence.

They peer over the barricade. In the pitch blackness, all
they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. These
are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection
from the torch.

A voice shouts out from the darkness.

<b>                    ARMY OFFICER
</b>          Fire!

A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as
though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut.

A dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag
falls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the
cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound
several men.

<b>                    ENJOLRAS

          waste powder!                                           

In the darkness, the clang of ramrods in muskets - the troop      
reloading weapons.                                                

Enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up      
when the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many                  
insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the     
top of the barricade.

</b>          Vive la France!

<b>                    ARMY OFFICER
</b>          Fire!

A second volley.

Father Mabeuf falls down dead. While everyone is reacting to   
the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from   
noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of
darkness to creep down the street.

All at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the
rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over
the barricade. The students run for their guns and return
fire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the
first instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the
barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce
resistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier
aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of
Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe.
<b>                                                       94.
</b>

They are being   overrun. Panic ensues. The gun battle is
fierce. Marius   in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost   
unless they do   something. He drags a barrel of gunpowder to
the top of the   barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of
deadly resolve   he tips the torch towards the barrel.

<b>                     MARIUS

          with it!

Marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg.

But already the soldiers have cleared out.

Marius comes down from the barricade.

lying propped against the barricade.

     being dismantled. And bodies.

     Suddenly he knows what he's going to do. He sees a dead
     soldier. He takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on.

     He continues on his way in the dark.

     Looking up he sees that he's been walking all the time
     towards the very barricade where Marius waits.

     Now looking like a soldier, he passes unchallenged through
     their lines, and into the shadows.

     As he passes, he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the          
     rooftops.

</b>
     Glimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching
     from the far end of the narrow street.

     The figure comes into lamp light. It's Valjean, in the
     soldier's jacket. The student sentries level their guns.
     Gavroche jumps up.

     The student sentries open the slot in the barricade to let
     Valjean enter.

He points to Javert, in a dark corner, his hands tied.

</b>          He's going to get it too!                              

Javert looks up and meets Valjean's eyes. A steady shared
look.

          soldier!                                               

Suddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the     
roofs to gain an angle of attack on them. They are aiming at
Enjolras. Swiftly Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them      
sending them scattering. Quickly other students join in and
the snipers are driven back.

There is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a   
brief fire fight ensues.                                        

The snipers have disappeared.                                    

Enjolras turns to Valjean.

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          Give me the spy Javert!

Javert hears this with grim satisfaction.

He turns to his little army.

Valjean takes Javert out the back of the Cafe Musain. He     
carries a knife.                                             

<b>                    VALJEAN

          knife.

Valjean uses the knife to cut Javert free.

</b>          You talk too much.
          Your life is safe in my hands.

          Yes, Valjean, you want a deal!

          If you let me go, beware!

He raises his gun and points it at Javert.

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          Go!

As Javert goes, he raises the gun barrel and fires a single
shot into the air.

Marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the   
smaller barricades.

taken up more seriously by Feuilly. Bottles are passed round.

     Grantaire glares at Enjolras and enters the cafe.

     Valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears Marius         
     through a window. He moves to the window. Marius sits beneath   
     it.

     Valjean listens to Marius's song, and he's moved.

     CRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded
     street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets
     round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many
     that we know the little band can never win.

     CRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that
     entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the
     centre of the bright lights of Paris.

     He has been on a reconnaissance. He looks at the street. No

     crack - a face peeps - and it closes again. Below him the

Gavroche is already climbing the barricade under cover of
the smoke.

          When he's just a pup -
          We'll fight like twenty armies
          And we won't give up!

The rays of the rising sun break through, lighting up
Gavroche.

<b>                    GAVROCHE
</b>          So you'd better run for cover
          When the pup grows -

Crack! A musket shot. Gavroche falls face down onto the
barricade.

<b>                    COURFEYRAC
</b>          No-o!

He runs up the barricade, seizes Gavroche's body in his
arms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the
gate in the barricade.

At the other end of the street Javert has appeared. He sees
this gate. And talks to the Army Officer.

As the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed
drawing field artillery into position. The Army Officer is
lining up the big guns carefully.

          No chance at all!

Enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group.

<b>                    ENJOLRAS

          Until the earth is free!

The sun now appears above the rooftops of the city.

And the big guns fire - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

The bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it. In its wake     
a massive barrage of musket fire.

The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst
right through in the first hit.

Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball
smashes into the piled debris. Javert is glimpsed among the
attackers.

Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the
barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles
down to others to be re-loaded, firing again.

Valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting
down the dead, regardless of his own safety.

Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs
towards him -

CRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade
and now the soldiers are storming through. The hard core of
student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Café
Musain.

      Students and soldiers fight in the café, on the stairs, up
      the stairs to the upper room. Students driving back the
      pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it
      to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them -
      students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants
      of the stairs. Grantaire is still unconscious from drink.

<b>99    INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY                                       99
</b>
      The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling
      sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to
      clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the
      students are falling.

      Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. A soldier
      challenges him. One violent blow from Valjean sends the
      soldier flying -

      The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find
      there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window,
      knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him the
      soldiers hesitate. The sudden silence wakes Grantaire from
      his drunken slumber.

<b>                          GRANTAIRE
</b>                Long live the republic!

      He sees Enjolras with the muskets raised against him.
      Grantaire goes and joins him. Enjolras smiles, and raises his
      now-ragged red flag.

      The rifles blaze. Grantaire drops back to the ground.
      Enjolras falls back -

      hangs upside down, the red flag still in his hands,
      streaming like blood down the wall.

      PULL BACK to see the street littered with corpses, and the
      remains of the barricade, and soldiers scouring the rubble
      for any last pockets of resistance.

      BACK AND BACK to come to a stop looking at the wide scene.
      INTO FRAME walks Javert, grimly surveying the victory of
      law over rebellion.


<b>103   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                       103
</b>
      Valjean carries Marius down a long narrow alley that runs
      between the backs of tall houses. The alley turns a corner -
      and there ahead is a dead end. Behind him, the stamp of
      soldiers' boots. Ahead, no way out.

      Then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the
      ground. A storm drain.

      ON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the
      end of the alley. They look round. It's empty.

<b>                          SOLDIER
</b>                Nothing here!

      The soldiers depart. A moment of silence.

      Then into the alley's end steps Javert. Not so easily
      fooled. He walks all the way to the end, and looks round.
      He sees the drain at his feet. He sees the signs that the
      grating has been lifted.

      He stoops, and tries to lift it. It's far too heavy for
      him.

      He straightens up and looks round, calculating. Where does
      the drain lead?


<b>104   INT. PARIS SEWERS - DAY                                     104
</b>
      Valjean is pulling Marius after him down a tight sloping
      pipe, where dark water races. Suddenly they start to slide,
      then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. Faint
      light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. The
      skitter of rats. Sodden forms floating by: dead bodies.

      Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as
      he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an
      intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through
      distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he
      lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground
      to rest. He lets his eyes close.

      A voice echoes in the shadows.
<b>                                                    109.

          Stuck into a tooth -
          Pardon me, m'sieur,
          You won't be needing it no more.
          Shouldn't be too hard to sell.

A figure coming closer. A sewer thief, robbing corpses. No
sign of life in either Valjean or Marius.

<b>                    THENARDIER
</b>          Well, someone's got to clean'em
          up, my friends,
          Before the little harvest
          Disappears into the mud.
          Someone's got to collect their
          odds and ends
          When the gutters run with blood.

Now we see the thief is Thenardier. He finds a ring on
Marius's finger and pulls it off.

<b>                    THENARDIER
</b>          Here's a tasty ring
          Pretty little thing
          Heart's no longer going
          And he's lived his little time,
          But his watch is ticking yet.

          It's a world where the dog eats
          the dog.
          Where they kill for the bones in
          the street.
          And God in his heaven,
          He don't interfere
          Cos he's dead as the stiff at my

          heavens
          And only the moon looks down.
          The harvest moon shines down!

Valjean wakes, rears up, seizes Thenardier by the arm,
slams him against the sewer wall.

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          How do I get out of here?

<b>                    THENARDIER
</b>          There! That way!

Valjean drops him, picks Marius up once more, and sets off.

Thenardier stares after them, grinning. He's sent then the
wrong way.

LATER - Valjean in the sewers, Marius on his back, and
they're sinking ever deeper into the slimy water.
<b>                                                             110.
</b>

      As he feels himself sink, Valjean holds Marius up in his
      arms and forges on, chest deep, lifting the younger man
      above his head. Still he sinks, until his face is half-
      submerged and he's gagging in the filth. He stumbles, and
      suddenly he's sunk beneath the surface, and Marius is
      dropping -

      Then up he bursts again, face black with slime, eyes
      burning with his refusal to be beaten.

      LATER - Valjean staggers down the endless sewers, Marius on
      his back. But all the time he can hear, closer now, the
      rushing sound of the river.

      Round a bend and at last - moonlight ahead.                           

      He drags himself on through the shallow running water
      towards the moonlight.                                                

      He reaches the exit at last. Before him the river.

      Valjean, crusted with slime, heaves Marius out of the sewer
      onto the embankment that runs beside the river.

      He looks up. There, staring at him, is Javert.

      Valjean rises slowly. Heaves Marius up onto his back once
      more. The strain of the night is showing. He's a man near
      the end of his strength.

<b>                           VALJEAN

                once more.

He starts to move past Javert.

Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head.

<b>                    JAVERT

Valjean meets his eyes. That old battle of will against
will.

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          Then I die.

He starts walking past Javert. Javert's hand trembles as it
holds the pistol.

Valjean keeps walking. Javert wills himself to shoot, but
he just can't do it. Frustrated, enraged with himself, he
lowers the gun.

<b>                    JAVERT

He turns away, trembling now all up and down his body. He
stares into the river. Valjean is gone now. He's alone.

<b>                    JAVERT
</b>          Who is this man?
          What sort of devil is he?

He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps,
towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the
turmoil in his brain.

He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. Here he
stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river.
The Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents
swirl round the piles of the bridge.

<b>                    JAVERT

night sky.

      He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he
      wants some angel from on high to save him - and so,

      CLOSE ON MARIUS - He's waking from the nightmare, finding
      himself in a fine bed, with clean linen. He looks round: a
      handsome room.

                you're alive.

      Timidly the old man comes closer to the bed. Tears form in
      Marius's eyes. Encouraged, the old man takes Marius's hand
      in his.

      Marius makes his way slowly up the stairs to the upper
      room. He's still weak from his wounds. He enters the room
      where his friends died, and looks round. He sinks into a
      chair.

      He sees the bloodstain on the wall beneath the window sill.
      The blood of Enjolras.

                And they rose with voices ringing

                The very words that they had sung
                Became their last communion
                On the lonely barricade at dawn.

      He looks out of the window at what's left of the barricade.
      He seems to see again the brave doomed defence, the smoke
      and the gunfire, the young men falling.

                 now?
                 Thank God, thank God, I've lived
                 to see this day!

       Marius comes to him.

<b>                            MARIUS
</b>                 It's you who must forgive a
                 thoughtless fool!
                 It's you who must forgive a
                 thankless man!
                 It's thanks to you that I am
                 living,
                 And again I lay down my life at
                 your feet.
                 Cosette, your father is a saint!
                 When they wounded me
                 He took me from the barricade,
                 Carried like a babe,
                 And brought me home to you!

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          Now you are here
          Again beside me
          Now I can die in peace
          For now my life is blessed...

<b>                    COSETTE
</b>          You will live, papa
          You're going to live
          It's too soon
          Too soon to say goodbye.

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to
          die!
          I'll obey
          I will try...

He holds out a letter for her.

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          On this page
          I write my last confession.
          Read it well
          When I at last am sleeping.
          It's the story
          Of one who turned from hating
          A man who only learned to love
          When you were in his keeping.

Cosette takes the letter and kisses it.

<b>                    COSETTE
</b>          I know it, papa.

Valjean turns back, face shining, towards the table where
the candles burn in the silver candlesticks. There he sees
three ghosts waiting for him. The ghost of the Bishop. The
ghost of Fantine. And beyond her, watching Marius with
love, the ghost of Eponine.

Fantine comes towards him, reaching out her hands.

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          I'm ready now, Fantine.

<b>                    FANTINE
</b>          Come with me
          Where chains will never bind you
          All your grief
          At last, at last behind you
          Lord in heaven
          Look down on him in mercy -

<b>                    VALJEAN
</b>          Forgive me all my trespasses
          And take me to your glory!
<b>                                                           125.
</b>

      Cosette embraces Valjean, weeping.

      Valjean reaches up his hands, and lets the ghost of Fantine
      take them.

<b>                          FANTINE/EPONINE
</b>                Take my hand
                I'll lead you to salvation
                Take my love
                For love is everlasting...

<b>                          VALJEAN/FANTINE/EPONINE/BISHOP
</b>                And remember
                The truth that once was spoken:
                To love another person
                Is to see the face of God...

      Led by Fantine, Valjean walks out of the Chapel towards the
      cloister.

      What remains is Cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the
      man who has just died.

      The walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles.
      The Bishop of Digne waits in front of the candles. Now
      Valjean's strong and young again. Before they reach the
      wall of candles, all three are gone.

      As they disappear we CRANE UP, high over the cloister, high
      over the walls of the Convent and we see the Paris streets
      outside. Fires are burning and debris is scattered in the
      streets. Dawn is breaking.

      From far away, the sound of an approaching crowd -


<b>117   EXT. PLACE DE LA BASTILLE - DAY                             117
</b>
      THE CAMERA MOVES over the cobbles as the light of the
      rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street
      battle. Past the remains of a barricade.

      The distant sound of an approaching march.

<b>      SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
</b>
                Sixteen years later
                Paris, 1848.

      From far off, the swelling sounds of the approaching march
      become the words of a song.

<b>                          MARCHERS
</b>                Do you hear the people sing
                Lost in the valley of the night?
                It is the music of a people
                Who are climbing to the light
                For the wretched of the earth

                    MARCHERS (cont'd)
          There is a flame that never dies
          Even the darkest night will end
          And the sun will rise.

As THE CAMERA RISES we see we're in the Place de la
Bastille. The triumphal column has long been completed, but
the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become
incorporated into an immense barricade - three stories
high, seven hundred feet long. Down all the streets that
converge on the square we now see the multiple victory
marches approaching. They cheer and beat drums as they
climb up to the top of the barricade.

<b>SUPERIMPOSE CAPTIONS:
</b>
          The people of Paris have risen in
          their tens of thousands.

          The King has fled. A new Republic
          is born.

There in the forefront of one column march Marius and
Cosette.

<b>                    MARCHERS
</b>          They will live again in freedom
          In the garden of the Lord
          They will walk behind the plough-
          share
          They will put away the sword
          The chain will be broken
          And all men will have their
          reward!

As the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many
there are: thousand upon thousand. And there marching among
them we see ghosts from the past - Enjolras and the
students who died - and Fantine - and Eponine -

And out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost: the
grinning face of Gavroche. He climbs out to dance on the
elephant, as the crowd fill the square.

<b>                    MARCHERS
</b>          Will you join in our crusade?
          Who will be strong and stand with
          me?
          Somewhere beyond the barricade
          Is there a world you long to see?

As the marchers converge, there watching them are
Thenardier and his wife. Thenardier gives the marchers a
wave of greeting. Survivors to the last.

<b>                    MARCHERS
</b>          Do you hear the people sing?
          Say, do you hear the distant

          It is the future that they bring
          When tomorrow comes!

Now among the marchers we see the ghost of Valjean, singing
with the rest atop the barricade, amongst the waving red
flags.
