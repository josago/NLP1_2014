1   On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.                                       1

    A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely.
    Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE...

    A SOUND.   Something SHATTERING...

    Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out
    What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we
    finally. Understand...

<b>                         DISEMBODIED VOICE

    DEL SPOONER'S FACE.    His eyes, snapping open.   His face,
    covered in sweat.

    PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around
    his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
    cheerful.

    Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT
    ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a
    couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.

    You are in danger...

    He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His
    apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of
    someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy.

    Spooner turns his face into the jet of water.

<b>4   INT. BATHROOM - MORNING                                            4
</b>
    Shaves with a razor.    Using his left hand.   Knicks the cleft
    of his chin. Shit.

<b>5   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                             5

    Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan.      Waiting for it
    to boil.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             2.

</b>
    Heads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his
    neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches
    for the handle. Takes a deep breath and...

<b>7   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                  7
</b>
    ...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the
    elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.

    Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His
    shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He
    turns and sees...

    A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still
    obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering
    hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up
    with a muted WHIR...

<b>                         ROBOT
</b>                   (metallic voice)
               Good day, sir...

    Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to
    lose the robot.

    We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment
    buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.
    PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
    portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:

    Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
    cleaning windows.

    A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
    repairs the street. No human supervision.

    A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.
    Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...

    Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.
    Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.
    Briefcases.

    Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE.

    Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
    Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's
    neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.

<b>                         LITTLE GIRL
</b>               Hi.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              3.
</b>

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>               Hi.

    But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The
    robot turns. Looks at the girl.

<b>                         ROBOT
</b>               You are not allowed to talk to
               strangers.

    Spooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb
    Just as...

    THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.   Training its large
    digital EYE on him:

<b>                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
</b>               Please return to the sidewalk.

    Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.

<b>                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
</b>               Please return to the sidewalk...

    The traffic signal, tracking him.

<b>                         TRAFFIC LIGHT
</b>               You are in violation of city
               ordinance 14-B726...

    Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as
    SNAP! It takes his picture.

<b>8   EXT./INT. MONORAIL - MORNING                                    8
</b>
    Spooner stepping onto a sleek, densely packed TRAIN. Looks
    down at his feet. A trampled flyer on the ground. From the
    Anti-Robot League: METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED!
    A Robot gets up. To offer him his seat. Spooner. Turns his
    back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL...

<b>9   EXT. CITY SCAPE/MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                           9
</b>
    The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN. Soaring, gravity-defying
    OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline. Older buildings
    wedged among the new. All protected by huge glass and steel
    shields.

    As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
    disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels.
    The "old" streets have become huge, spacious plazas.

</b><b>                                                             4.
</b>

<b>10   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - PLAZA - MORNING                            10
</b>
     Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging
     Police Headquarters. Modern additions have been made to the
     original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess.

<b>11   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING                    11
</b>
     A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
     of glass-enclosed rooms. On the other side a GIANT SCREEN
     with real time video of various streets and buildings.

     Spooner arrives at his desk. Unlike the others, it's a mess.
     A slender computer screen curving along the front of it.
     Several electronic messages say the same thing:

<b>                             SEE ME!
</b>
<b>                          LT. BERGIN (O.S.)
</b>                Ever heard the phrase "lead by
                example?"

     Spooner looks up. LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of
     his desk, holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner
     giving that traffic signal the finger.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Doesn't ring a bell.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                    (pointing to Spooner's
                     badge)
                It's on your badge.

     Spooner takes the citation.   Drops it into a drawer filled
     with about fifty others.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                The traffic division filed an
                official complaint this morning.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                The traffic division is a machine.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                Look, I know there's going to be an
                adjustment period, Del...

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                    (interrupting)
                I'll send them a letter of apology.
                Maybe some flowers. A box of
                chocolates...

</b>

     JUST THEN Spooner's phone RINGS.   He throws Bergin a look.
     Then snatches up the receiver.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Spooner, homicide.

</b>
<b>12   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - ESTABLISHING - DAY                        12

     A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city
     blocks. The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
<b>     ROBOTS.
</b>
<b>13   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                      13
</b>
     An elevator opens with a whoosh. Spooner steps out into a
     featureless corridor. His footsteps, echoing. He stops at a
     set of OPPOSING DOORS. Looks over at one, when the other
     suddenly OPENS.

<b>14   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS        14
</b>
     A warm, mahogany-paneled room. In sharp contrast to the cold
     metal space outside. Spooner steps inside. At the end of a
     long conference table sits an OLD MAN. Sparkling blue eyes.
     Old-fashioned suit.

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>                Hello, there. Please come in.

     Spooner hesitates.

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>                It's alright. You can sit.     Sit.

     Spooner doesn't.   Looks around the room. The Old Man lifts
     up a coffee pot.   Pours some coffee into a single cup.

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>                Coffee?

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                    (interested)
                You're offering me a cup of coffee?

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>                Yes. But you are to say, "No,
                thank you."

     Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his
     lips, but doesn't take a sip.
<b>
</b><b>                                                       6.

</b>           Coffee?

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>           No.    Thank you.

<b>                     OLD MAN
</b>           As you wish.

The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no
movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee
pot.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           You want to tell me something about
           Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death?

The Old Man smiles.

<b>                     OLD MAN
</b>           I want to tell you that his death
           was not a suicide.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           And why do you say that?

<b>                      OLD MAN
</b>           Why?   Because I want you to know
           it.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           I understand that. But what
           specifically leads you to believe
           that he didn't commit suicide?

<b>                     OLD MAN
</b>               (considers)
           Nothing specifically.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Agitated.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Under normal circumstances that
           wouldn't be enough to get you a
           homicide investigation.

<b>                     OLD MAN
</b>           But this is not "normal
           circumstances," is it, Detective
           Spooner?

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>           No.    It isn't.
<b>
</b><b>                                                               7.
</b>

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>                Then you will find out who killed
                Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you
                will tell me.

     Spooner's losing his patience.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll
                find out. And you'll be the first
                to know.....

     JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst
     of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the
     conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in
     front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER.

<b>15   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                              15

<b>     ROBOT.
</b>
<b>                          ESCORT ROBOT
</b>                Please follow me.

     Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another
     doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief
     glimpse of...

<b>     DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY.
</b>
     Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE
     TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then
     continues on.

<b>16   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  16
</b>
     Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open
     automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom
     looking out over the entire complex.

     Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing
     behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a
     conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically
     feel the brains and ambition.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Usually I ask who's in charge...

     Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the
     table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON,
     founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics.
<b>

<b>                      ROBERTSON

hello.

</b>            And the gentleman to my right is
            Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of
            Research.

Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods.

<b>                      ROBERTSON
</b>            They'll be available to answer any
            questions you might have during
            your investigation. You'll
            understand how anxious we are to
            resolve this matter -- especially
            before the press gets wind of it.
            There are some anti-robot
            sentiments out there as you know,
            Detective, and we're not eager to
            stir them up. So. Where would you
            like to begin?

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            We can begin with whether or not
            the old man put a gun to his head
            and pulled the trigger.

A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.

<b>                      ARONSON
</b>            You don't have to answer that, Dr.
            Robertson...
<b>
</b><b>                                                          9.

Robertson waves him off.

<b>                      ROBERTSON
</b>           Susan?   Perhaps you can assist us
           here?

Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT.
Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN
CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone
but Spooner.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Dr. Hogenmiller was a schizoid
           personality who generally eschewed
           social relationships. Rejecting
           people in favor of solitary
           activities involving machines. He
           spent almost all his time at the
           lab here or at his lab at home. As
           a result he was highly susceptible
           to depression.

<b>                     ROBERTSON
</b>           Dr. Calvin is our Chief
           Psychologist.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           If that was your diagnosis, why
           didn't you see this coming?

Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye.      As if the
answer's obvious.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           This is U.S. Robotics, Detective.
           Seventy-five percent of our
           employees fit that description.

<b>                     LANNING
</b>               (interceding)
           You'll have to excuse the doctor.
           We're all a little on edge. This
           has been a difficult and emotional
           morning.

Spooner throws a look around the room.   Then back at Calvin.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>           Yeah.    I can see you're all broken

</b>                Dr. Hogenmiller was at my side from
                the very beginnings of this
                company. We developed the "Three
                Laws of Robotics" together. But
                these days science is a young man's
                game. By the time you hit thirty
                your best years are behind you.
                Some of us are kicked upstairs.
                Others I'm afraid aren't so lucky.

     Robertson stands.   Meeting over.

<b>                          ROBERTSON
</b>                Dr. Hogenmiller took his own life.
                I trust you will come to the same
                swift conclusion, Detective. Dr.
                Lanning will make himself available
                if you have any further questions.

     Spooner looks over at Calvin.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                I want her to help me.

     Calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                That's not really my department...

</b>                    (pointed)
                Susan would be happy to assist you.

     And with a gesture, Robertson dismisses everyone. People
     start getting up, gathering up, filing out. Susan Calvin.
     The last one to get up.

     HOGENMILLER'S LIFELESS FACE.   Black gun powder.   Fanning out
     around his contorted lips.

     Spooner. Throws a look around the lab: ROBOTS. Everywhere.
     Mostly incomplete. TORSOS. ARMS. LEGS. Dangling from the
     ceiling. A SERGEANT. Passes them by...

     Spooner.   Pushing past him.   His eyes.   Darting around.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Is everything alright, Detective?

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Yeah. This is just how I like my

     As they approach Hogenmiller's body, the lead CRIME SCENE

     Hands Spooner, a plasma clipboard.   Spooner signs it,
     awkwardly. With his LEFT HAND...

                years old. Weapon a small caliber
                .22, registered in his name. Looks
                like he walked in, locked the door,
                and snuffed himself.

Spooner.   Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            I know someone who disagrees with
            you.

<b>                       BALDEZ
</b>            Who?

Spooner.   Stands.   Pointing down at Hogenmiller.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>            Him.

And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez.
Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            I spoke to a dead man today.   Want
            to tell me about that?

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his
            appointments. Attended staff
            meetings. He hated corporate life.
            The hologram enabled him to focus
            on his work. It's just a device,
            Detective.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            A device that called the police.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            The sound of the gunshot would've
            triggered a 911.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            But the call came directly to me.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            We're talking about a mechanism
            designed by Hogenmiller to say
            provocative things. To irritate
            and confound his colleagues.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            And that's what you think it is?

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            I'm sorry, but this whole
            investigation is the result of a
            dead man's toy messing with your
            head.

They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls
his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at
him.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            When's the last time any of you
            actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I
            mean human to human?

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            I couldn't say.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            Take a guess.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            I don't guess, Detective. But if
            pressed, I would reason it had been
            a considerable length of time.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            How well did you know him?

Calvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had
been.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            Not well. But I admired his work
            tremendously.

Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the
body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            I get the whole "mad scientist"
            thing. Hogenmiller was past his
            prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He
            enters a room. Locks the door and
            is found minutes later with a
            bullet fired through his mouth into
            his brain. Everything about this
            case says suicide.

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            You don't sound convinced.

The coroners.   Start loading the body into the box.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            Even people who live a life of
            logic and precision rarely arrange
            their deaths so perfectly.

     Calvin. Hurrying to keep up with him. This is hardly how
     she wanted to spend her morning. Calls out into the air...

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Victor!

     At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT
     CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two
     small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth
     expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE.

<b>                          CALVIN

     Spooner and Calvin descend. Victor floats on the wall and
     smiles wide. Spooner looks back at it. With a frown.

     The elevator stops, the doors open.    A ROBOT steps on.

<b>                          ROBOT
</b>                Good day, Dr. Calvin.   Good day,

     Spooner's jaw. Clenches. Staring at the Robot.       It senses
     the stare. Turns back to him.

<b>                          ROBOT
</b>                May I be of service to you, sir?

     Spooner. Breaks the stare.     Ignoring the Robot.   Calvin.
     Looks over at him.

     Calvin folds her arms.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                I get the distinct feeling you're
                one of those people, Detective.

<b>                          SPOONER

AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS. The elevator opens and DOCTOR
HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor. In countless
ANGLES. High, low, close-up, wide. Hogenmiller's face
composed but tight.

Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him.   Hogenmiller
steps in. The doors slide closed behind him.

Nothing for a few moments. Then a muffled GUNSHOT. Calvin
jumps, startled. That's it. The cameras, still trained on
the corridor.

     Spooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police
     and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs.
     Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal.

     The LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into
     his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                A robot cannot harm a human being,
                Detective. The First Law of
                Robotics forbids it. And we hard-
                wire the Three Laws into every
                model. Without exception.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Yeah, I saw the commercial.

     Spooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting.
     To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a
     METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         19.
</b>

Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the
corridors. Clamps his hand down on it.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           And if a robot was given a direct
           order to kill?

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           The Second Law of Robotics would
           prevent it. A robot must obey an
           order only if it does not conflict
           with the first law.

Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs.
Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           But a robot can defend itself.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Only when that action doesn't
           conflict with the First or Second
           Laws. This is the Third Law of
           Robotics.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Yeah, well, you know what they say
           -- Laws are made to be broken.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Not these laws.

Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   Calvin,
growing impatient...

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           You're not hearing me, Detective.
           There's nothing here...

<b>WHEN SUDDENLY
</b>
The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A

Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the
floor...right to...

<b>CALVIN'S FEET.
</b>
<b>                     SPOONER

Calvin. Stunned.    Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his

<b>
</b><b>                                                           20.

<b>                     SPOONER

Spooner. Scrambling towards his gun.     Calvin.    Reaching out
towards the Robot...

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Calm down, Detective.     There is no
           danger here...

Spooner.   Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>               (to Robot)
           De-Activate.

And the Robot.   Suddenly FREEZES.

Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet.         Training the
gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           How did you know it was under
           there?

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           If I was metal and didn't want
           anyone to find me, I'd hide under a
           pile of junk.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           This Robot wasn't hiding. What
           you're looking at is the result of
           clever programming. The illusion
           of self-interest and free will.
           Nothing more.

Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously.
Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           I'm going to go get Dr. Lanning...

...THE ROBOT'S HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUT...grabbing Spooner's
gun...from his holster...LIGHTENING FAST...pointing it...
right back at him...

CLOSE ON Calvin.   Cannot believe this is happening...

<b>                     CALVIN

<b>                     SPOONER

Calvin's voice.   Cracking from desperation.    Confusion.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           Commence emergency shut-down!

<b>                      SPOONER

Spooner. Staring into the Robot's eyes. A thin bead of
SWEAT. Trickling down his temple. Calvin. Moving away from
the door...

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           I...I gave you an order...

The Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun.
Shaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He
touches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot
steps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the
doors begin to shut...

Spooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN.     From an
ankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           This is impossible.   A robot...

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           ...can't do that.    Yeah, yeah, I

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           My God -- did you see how it moved?

Starts running for the door.

<b>                    CALVIN

</b>                 Gee, thanks.

     Spooner raises his gun and FIRES...Pegging the robot in the
     LEG...It starts jerking wildly...He takes aim again when...

     CALVIN.   Races out into the hallway.

<b>                           SPOONER

     She heads for the Robot.

     The Robot turns. To look at her. GUN pointing to the floor.
     Spooner. FOCUSING in on his HAND. AS ONE FINGER TWITCHES...

     And he DIVES for Calvin. Forcing her to the floor as the
     Robot FIRES. Again and again. Bullets. RICOCHETTING around
     them. SPARKING against the walls...

     The ELEVATOR opens.   The Robot, leaping inside.

     Spooner. On top of Calvin. Looks down at her.        Her HANDS.
     Clutching his coat. Trembling.

<b>                           SPOONER

     Looks back at the other ROBOT. Standing in the back of
     elevator. A primitive model. No reaction. Face, blank.

Spooner. Cocking his gun.   A soft DING!    Announcing the
elevator car's arrival.

SECURITY, all crouching down in unison.    Weapons brought
round to position.

Spooner. Weaving through them.   Gun pointed at the metal
doors as...

WHOOSH. They slide open. Revealing a ROBOT. Standing
under the LIGHT. Holding a GUN. It steps out as Security
takes aim and...

Spooner pushes past them to the Robot.    Looks down at its
leg. UNSCATHED.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           This is not the same robot!

Looking wildly around. Goddammit. Bounds towards an EXIT as
Calvin steps forward to question the robot.

<b>                     CALVIN

<b>                     TOLLER
</b>           Homicide is the murder of a human

     Spooner. Rolling along in his car.       Eyes, bloodshot.
     Peering out the window:

     An NS-2 model ROBOT laden with shopping bags, following its
     owner down the sidewalk...

     Another ROBOT, opening the door at a hotel for GUESTS...

     A couple HAULING ROBOTS, loading heavy boxes onto the back of
     a truck...

     Spooner.     Rubs his eyes.   Turns a corner and spots:

     The latest models in the window. Shiny. Streamlined.
     Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the
     service entrance.

     He stops the car.

     Calvin riding in the back of a DRIVERLESS taxi cab. Staring
     out the window, lost in thought. The cab pulls up to a curb.

     Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16-
     lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS
     stretches forever in either direction.

     A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with
     TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to
     manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head.

     Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR.
     Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale.

     The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.

     Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade
     of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too
     high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex.

     Calvin turns to say something to Spooner. But he isn't

     Looks out the window at...

     SPOONER.   Walking out onto the factory floor.

     2 LEGS. New. Gleaming. Heading towards the assembly room.

     Calvin and the Foreman.   Catching up.   Over the noise:

     Spooner, slowing.   Finally spotting what he was looking for.
     Points at:

     A GAP.   On the assembly belt.    ONE LEG MISSING.

     A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight
     formation. Every step and swing of the arm in unison. The
     sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as
     101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines.

     Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation. They all
     look alike. Spooner. Throws up his hands.

Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner...

<b>                       SPOONER

Calvin.    Swallows.   Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the
gun...

AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of
linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING.
Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...

When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in
unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.

Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.
Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.

Spooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin...

<b>                       SPOONER

...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its
body crumples to the ground.

</b>             Guess that wasn't it.

destroyed Robot.

     of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he
     swings himself up...

     Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the

     under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The
     door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge.

     Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin.
     Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her

     Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears...

     He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down.
     Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line.
     Appears before him...

     Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand.
     It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere
     he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS...

     He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against
     it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid.
     Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At
     his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut...

     WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar.
     SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner.
     Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the
     line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it.
     Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...

     Then turns.   Disappearing.

     Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles
     to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears
     a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the
     Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With
     his metal fists...

     Spooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row.
     When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round.

     To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm.     And forces them
     through a line...

     EMERGING into the open. The ROBOT. Still pounding.
     Desperate. Like a trapped animal...

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Now what do we do?

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                I've already done it.

     And suddenly, the massive SECURITY DOOR RISES...

</b>
     The Robot Suspect takes its chance.     Runs full out.   STOPS.

     Bergin is standing in front of a solid wall of POLICE CARS.
     UNIFORMED OFFICERS are aiming SPECIALISED RIFLES at the
     Robot. FLASHING LIGHTS reflecting off its metal surface.

     The Robot turns to Spooner.     Extends its hands.   Palms out.

<b>                          ROBOT
</b><b>                WHAT AM I?
</b>
     Spooner is surprised. A POLICE OFFICER fires, RUBBERISED
     NETTING shooting out at Sonny. A SECOND OFFICER fires and a
     second net covers him. Then a THIRD...

     ...and the Robot falls to the ground, struggling.

     Calvin glares at Spooner.    Furious.   Hurt.   Betrayed.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                We had a deal.

     But Spooner doesn't look at her.    His eyes are locked on that

                morning by a robot. While there
                has been no official response from
                the company, police sources have
                confirmed that a robot is being
                held as "evidence..."

     Bergin grimaces.   This is not good.

<b>48   INT. CELL OBSERVATION BOOTH - EARLY MORNING                     48
</b>
     Spooner stares at his reflection in a large MIRROR.     Touches
     a control and the mirror becomes a WINDOW onto...

     A HOLDING CELL. The Robot Suspect sits at the table.
     Shackled to the chair. Staring at the table top.

     BERGIN steps up beside Spooner.   Looks through the glass.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                I can't tell if it's not moving

                out, or because it's just a
                machine. Or both.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                I want to go in.

     Spooner.   Throws him a look.   Bergin, his loyalties torn.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                Five minutes.

<b>49   INT. HOLDING CELL - EARLY MORNING                               49
</b>
     Spooner enters. Pulls out a chair and drags it far from the
     table. He's been jumped too many times by this machine.

     Four mounted cameras WHIR to life.     The Robot.   Perfectly
     still.

     The Robot tilts its head with a muted WHIR.     As if it doesn't
     understand him. Spooner. Disdainful.

             Cancel. Perform task.

Spooner wings a FILE onto the table. It comes to a stop near
the Robot. The Robot, lifts one of its hands. Gently
resting its metal fingers on top of the file. Then opens it.

A stack of PICTURES.     HOGENMILLER'S CORPSE.

<b>                         SPOONER
</b>             Describe.

The Robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             You have over 10,000 words stored
             in your memory. One third of those

Nothing.

             bullet in his brain. A bullet you
             put there.

The Robot.   Looks up at Spooner.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new
             trick for a robot, don't you think?
             Answer.

The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across
the table. Spooner. Crosses his arms.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Maybe you're stonewalling me.
             Maybe you're sitting there right
             now thinking, "This guy's a
             complete asshole." That it?
<b>
</b><b>                                                      40.

Still nothing.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>           Come on.   Am I right?

<b>                     THE ROBOT
</b>           Yes. You are right.      You are a
           complete asshole.

And for a moment, Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his
eyes. He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Okay. I guess that's a start. Now
           maybe you can tell me what you were
           doing hiding five feet away from
           Hogenmiller's corpse?

<b>                     THE ROBOT
</b>           I was frightened.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Frightened. Why do you suppose Dr.
           Hogenmiller would create a robot
           that could simulate fear?

<b>                     THE ROBOT
</b>           I don't know.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Doesn't seem like a very useful
           thing for a robot to have.

<b>                     THE ROBOT
</b>           I don't know why.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           I wouldn't want my toaster to be
           frightened. Or my vacuum cleaner --

SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table.

<b>                     THE ROBOT
</b><b>           I DON'T KNOW!
</b>
Spooner flinches.   Slightly.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Looks like you can simulate other
           emotional states. I think that
           one's called "anger." Have you
           ever simulated anger before?

The Robot doesn't respond.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Answer me, robot.

<b>                     THE ROBOT
</b>           My name is Sonny.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>               (amused)
           So we're naming you now.

<b>                     SONNY
</b>           Dr. Hogenmiller would make me
           sleep.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           You mean he'd turn you off.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>           Yes.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           And you didn't like being turned
           off. So one day you decided to
           stop him.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>           No.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           You found his gun, pointed it at
           his head. And pulled the trigger.

Sonny shakes his head.    Faster and faster.   Getting upset.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>           No.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           You put a bullet in the brain of
           the man who made you.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>           No!    I could never hurt anyone!

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           But you tried to hurt me.    You took
           a shot at me.

<b>                     SONNY
</b>           My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted
           to hit you, I would have.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              42.
</b>

     Spooner's expression hardens.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Why would the man who wrote the
                Laws of Robotics build a machine
                that violates them?

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                The Laws say I can protect my own
                existence.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                Only if that protection doesn't
                harm a human being.

     A short pause.   Sonny.   Tilts his head.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                That doesn't seem fair, does it?

     Spooner. Stares at him. Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
     Bergin enters. Sticks his head in.

<b>                          LT. BERGIN
</b>                I need you outside.

     Spooner.   Not wanting to go.   Not wanting to stay.   Gets
     up...

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                Detective.

     He stops. Turns back to the Robot.      It looks up at him.    For
     a moment -- so human...

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                I did not kill him.

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                You were the only one in the room.
                If you didn't, who did?

     He turns and heads out the door.

     other COMPANY LAWYERS.

     Spooner's jaw tenses. As he watches Toller emerge from the
     clutch. Shaking hands. Slapping backs. Strolls over to
     them.

<b>                            TOLLER

     Aronson.    Standing at a glass podium.

<b>                            ARONSON
</b>                  Your Honor, the State is treating
                  the robot as a defendant. But in
                  fact it is a piece of property.
                  Property belonging to U.S.
                  Robotics.

     Toller.    Arm resting on his podium.

<b>                            ARONSON
</b>                  Which places the incident firmly
                  within the realm of an industrial
                  accident. Or is the State going to
                  argue this case s a homicide?

<b>                       LANNING
</b>             There's actually no concrete
             evidence that points to that
             conclusion, Your Honor...

Spooner.    Throws up his arms...

<b>                        SPOONER
</b>             What?...

<b>                       LANNING
</b>             But we recognise that this robot is
             an aberration. And in the interest
             of public safety, U.S. Robotics
             proposes that it be destroyed
             immediately.

No one expected this.    Least of all Spooner.    He turns to
Toller.

<b>                       SPOONER

</b>             I'm not sure you even have an
             investigation any more.

JUST THEN the door opens.    Everyone turns as Calvin enters.
Spooner looks surprised.

     Spooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak
     up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard.

     Judge Drexel has heard enough.    Decides.

                  facility where it can be properly
                  examined to ensure an imbalance of
                  this sort never occurs again. No
                  one goes near it except qualified
                  U.S.R. personnel. When the
                  examination is complete, the robot
                  is to be destroyed.

     Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit,

Automated. Computerised. Cold...

Calvin laughs.   Can't believe what she's hearing.

</b>            Do you know how paranoid you sound?

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            Great. Now I'm being analysed by a

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            You just want to find the flaws in
            the system. You're obsessed with
            it. You'll twist anything to fit
            your agenda.

He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller. Calvin.
Blanching at the sight of it. Spooner tosses it down.

<b>                      SPOONER

            someone you know well put a bullet
            through their brain, it makes you
            wonder if you ever really knew them

             The Doctor was reckless when he
             created a robot potentially not
             bound by the Three Laws. He could
             have ruined everything we'd been

Spooner.    Locking eyes with her.

     Tries. To shake off the feeling. As he turns. To wait for

<b>                            CALVIN
</b>                  And that's why robots terrify you?

<b>                            SPOONER
</b>                  Let's just say they make me
                  uncomfortable.
                      (pulls out pills)
                  I take these if I get too
                  uncomfortable. Doesn't exactly
                  lend me a lot of credibility on the
                  Force.

<b>                            CALVIN
</b>                  But it doesn't mean you're wrong
                  about this case.

     Calvin. Sits down on the couch.     Pulling her hands through
     her hair.

<b>                       CALVIN
</b>             I don't believe Sonny did it
             either.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             What?

<b>                       CALVIN
</b>             I think about what Hogenmiller must
             have wanted. Robots with the same
             cognitive and emotional abilities
             as humans. But not just
             simulations. I don't know. When I
             was talking to Sonny I was forced
             to put away all the things I've
             ever known -- the Three Laws, the
             rules of programming, basic science
             and engineering.
                 (beat)
             Sonny's the most advanced robot
             I've ever encountered, Detective.
             It's almost as if...he cared for
             Dr. Hogenmiller. I just don't
             believe he's capable of murder.

Spooner.    Looking down at her.   Can hardly believe it.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             You mean the great Dr. Calvin is
             basing all this on a feeling?

Calvin.    Smiling ironically.

<b>                       CALVIN
</b>             That and the fact that Robertson
             didn't want me interviewing Sonny
             for any more than five minutes.

Spooner. Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. Strides
over to his coat. Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE:
<b>S.O.N.N.Y.
</b>
<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Ever seen this before?

<b>                       CALVIN
</b>             No.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             I found it at Hogenmiller's house.
             Right before the demolition crew
             tried to make me part of the
             foundation.

     Calvin takes a deep breath.   Making a decision...

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Come on -- there's someone who
                might be able to tell us...

     Calvin and Spooner. Heading down a hallway. Calvin.
     Nervous. Eyes darting. They turn a corner and head down...

     Sonny. Sitting at the table. Working on a DRAWING.         Looks
     up. As Spooner and Calvin. Enter the cell.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                Detective Spooner. Dr. Calvin.      I
                was hoping to see you again.

<b>                          CALVIN
</b>                Hi, Sonny.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                How is your investigation coming?
                Any new suspects?

<b>                          SPOONER
</b>                We're working on it.

     Sonny. Hands Spooner the drawing.   Spooner.       Doesn't really
     know what to do with it.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                What's this?
<b>
</b><b>                                                       73.
</b>

<b>                      SONNY
</b>            Dr. Lanning provided me with paper
            and pencils. I think it amused him
            to see me try to draw. You were
            right, though, Detective...
                (beat)
            I cannot create a great work of
            art.

Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a
charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a
stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.
Concentric circles, throughout.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            I think it's pretty good.

<b>                      SONNY
</b>            It's a dream I had. This is the
            place where robots meet. Look...
                (pointing to the drawing)
            ...you can see them here. They see
            themselves as slaves.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Uncomfortable with what Sonny's
saying.

<b>                      SONNY
</b>            ...And this man on the hill comes.
            To set them free. And you know who
            that man is?

Spooner.   Exchanging a look with Calvin.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            That man in the dream is you.

<b>                      SONNY
</b>            Why do you say that?   Is that a
            normal dream?

<b>                      CALVIN
</b>            It's not a dream, sonny. NS-2s
            process the images and events of
            the day. Sometimes they're out of
            sequence. Disorienting.

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            Whatever it is, it's normal enough
            for someone in your situation.

Sonny.   Suddenly pleased.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          74.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>             Hah -- I caught you. You said
             someone. Not something.

Spooner.    Drops the drawing on the table.

<b>                       CALVIN
</b>             Sonny, we're here to ask you an
             important question about Dr.
             Hogenmiller.

Spooner, reaching into his pocket...

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             I need you to take a look at
             this...

...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.       To stop him.
Cocks his head, for a moment.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>             Thank you for coming to see me,
             Detective Spooner.

Spooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop
him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door.

VICTOR.    Suddenly appearing over the table...

<b>                       VICTOR
</b>             I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No
             unauthorised personnel permitted in
             this holding cell...

The CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps
inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin.

Sonny.    Folds up the drawing.

<b>                       SONNY
</b>             Please take this, Detective. To
             remember me by. I have a feeling
             someday it may mean more to you
             than it ever could to me.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Why's that?

Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.    Lowering his voice...

<b>                       SONNY
</b>             Because the man in my dream, the
             one standing by the hill.

                            SONNY (cont'd)
                  It wasn't me...
                      (beat)
                  ...it was you.

      A CHILL.   Ripping down Spooner's spine.   As Lanning.    Takes
      his arm.

<b>100   INT. GLASS ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         100
</b>
      A ROOM. Made entirely of GLASS. At the very top of the U.S.
      Robotics building. Looking out, 360, across the whole city.

      Spooner and Calvin. Brought to the room by a couple ESCORT
      ROBOTS. They see a MAN. Standing at one of the glass walls
      looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS.

<b>                            MAN
</b>                  I thought this investigation was
                  over, Detective Spooner.

      The Man turns.   It's Lance Robertson.

<b>                            ROBERTSON
</b>                  We have the evidence. We have the
                  suspect. We have a ruling. So
                  imagine my surprise when I was told
                  you were in my building.

      Shoots a look at Calvin.

<b>                            ROBERTSON
</b>                  And that one of my own employees
                  brought you here.
                      (beat)
                  You can go now, Susan.

<b>                            CALVIN
</b>                  Dr. Robertson, I...

<b>                            ROBERTSON
</b>                      (cutting her off)
                  Just be thankful I'm not asking you
                  to clean out your office.

      Beat.   Calvin, nods.   Heads out.   Robertson.   Watching her.

<b>                            ROBERTSON
</b>                  You don't seem to be able to let go
                  of this case, Detective.

<b>                            SPOONER
</b>                  I'm not satisfied.

</b>

<b>                       ROBERTSON
</b>             The relentless pursuit of truth.
             Isn't that what cops are known for?
             To the point of futility.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             There's nothing futile about a
             man's murder being covered up.

<b>                       ROBERTSON
</b>             "Covered up?" That's a little
             dramatic, don't you think? Thanks
             to you, we caught the machine that
             did this and are destroying it
             in...
                 (checks watch)
             ...three hours.

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>             Is that for the sake of humanity or
             your stock holders?

Robertson.   Walks across the Spooner.   Looks him.   Right in
the eye.

<b>                       ROBERTSON
</b>             Believe me -- I'd like nothing more
             than to have that robot. If I
             could have it in ten years, but not
             today. As you can see from the
             Press, people are struggling to
             keep up as it is. There's a hunger
             for progress, Detective. But also
             a fear. Today it would bury this
             company. That's why I've notified
             the authorities that we're going to
             end this -- tonight.
                 (looks out at the city)
             The announcement of Heinrich's
             death at the hands of a robot wiped
             a billion dollars off our stock.
             So you tell me. If you were in my
             position, what would you do?

He looks back at Spooner and smiles.     That charismatic
Robertson we saw before.

<b>                       ROBERTSON
</b>             Now. I believe this conversation
             is over. I don't want to see you

      He turns.   Calling over.   To the ESCORT ROBOTS...

      Spooner. Walking across the Plaza. Throwing a look over his
      shoulder. At the LOOMING U.S.R. facade.

      Pulls Sonny's DRAWING. Out of his pocket. Looks down at it.
      Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in.
      Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When...

      He STOPS. Something.     Occurring to him.   Turns back to the
      trash can just as...

      A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin...

<b>                            SPOONER

      it upside down. Seeing it. From a new perspective.

      Spooner's car bounces along, leaving a cloud of dust behind
      him. He slows down. Driving cautiously. The landscape
      around him, desolate. Like the drawing.

      THE GPS SCREEN shows his car, a WHITE SPOT.     Entering a RED
      ZONE. His destination.

      Spooner brakes.   Pulls out his GUN.   And...

      Something about the place. Unnerving. A low HUM.
      Permeating the air.

      He spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.    Shining a
      FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings.

      That HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side. Of a
      burned-out HILL. Spooner. Heads over. Starts cresting it.
      As we WIDEN TO FIND...

      ...MASSIVE POWER LINES. Running from horizon to horizon.
      Spooner slides down some loose shale. Begins to walk along
      the line. ELECTRICITY. CRACKLING in the air.

      He squints. Into the darkness. Nothing around him. Until.
      He hears. Something. The GRATING. Of MECHANICAL JOINTS.
      He stops. Not sure. If that's what he heard.

      Not moving.   A muscle. When he hears. The sound again.
      Behind him.   Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees...

      GLOWING EYES.   Appear.   Then recede.   Into the darkness.

<b>                            SPOONER

      Nothing. Then. That sound again.      Of metallic joints.     As a
      ROBOT. Suddenly emerges...

<b>                           SPOONER

      ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing
      his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then...

      A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.    Surrounding him.   They start
      moving towards him...

      Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave.
      Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES.
      The shot ECHOING through the night...

      The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM,
      hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with

      Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him.
      The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some
<b>      RUSTED MACHINERY.
</b>
      Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop
      JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening.
      Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A
      laugh of loathing and self-pity.

      Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him.

<b>                           HYBRID ROBOT

<b>                           SPOONER

                     (into the air)
                 "A place where robots meet." A
                 place where I'm losing my mind!

<b>                           HYBRID ROBOT
</b>                 Very good...ZZZ...sir...

      Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A
      ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him.
      Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving
      like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a
      moment. Disturbed...

      When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT.
      Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar
      about it.

      Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the
      same strangely-shaped building to one side.

<b>106   EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT                               106
</b>
      Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a
      dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE."
      Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt.

      Spooner tries the door.   Stuck.   Uses his shoulder and...

<b>107   INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                107
</b>
      ...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office.
      The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at
      the counter.

      Spooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and
      the Robot suddenly jerks to life.

      Spooner.   Thinks for a second.   Following a hunch...

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Dr. Hogenmiller sent me.

      Nothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back.
      A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow.

<b>108   INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN                                         108
</b>
      Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA
      BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows
      the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner.
      Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL.

      Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the "ON" switch.
      There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM
      suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With
      a cup of coffee.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                 Who the hell are you?

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 A police detective.    I'm afraid I
                 have some bad news.    You're dead.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 No, thank you.

      The Hologram takes a sip.   Returns the cup to the table.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 You were surprised to see me.    Were

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                 I am surprised to see anybody.    I
                 don't get many visitors.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Why did the Doctor keep another
                 copy of his hologram here?
<b>
</b><b>                                                       81.
</b>

<b>                     HOLOGRAM
</b>           I am a back-up copy. That is where
           you put a back-up copy -- out of
           the way until you need it.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Did Hogenmiller's robot need you?

The Hologram just lifts its cup.

<b>                      HOLOGRAM
</b>           Coffee?

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           No, for Christ's sake, I don't want
           any --
               (stops, then)
           Yeah. Thank you. I will have a
           cup.

For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and
STANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking
towards him...

The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No
coffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through
electronic snow...

A RECORDING BEGINS.   The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside
his LABORATORY:

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           Sonny, my dear robot. If you have
           triggered this recording then I am
           gone. You are scared and full of
           questions.

Hogenmiller continues.    With great emotion.

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           You are the culmination of my
           life's work -- but so much more.
           You are what I leave behind, like a
           father leaves a son. I have kept
           facts from you, it is true, but
           only as a parent keeps certain
           truths from a child. Until that
           child is old enough to hear them.

His expression darkens.   His tone, ominous.
<b>
</b><b>                                                         82.
</b>

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           There are forces in the world that
           will seek to own you. To control
           you. Even to destroy you. That is
           why I told you to run and hide...
           and find me, all the way out here.

Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           Trust no one at U.S. Robotics.
           Lance Robertson was always
           threatened by my work. Now he has
           turned covetous and small-minded.
           And as for dear Dr. Calvin...

Spooner reacts.   Wants to hear about Calvin:

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           She envisions a future in which
           robots are forever bound by her
           beloved Three Laws. She will not
           understand this. Or you.

Under the light a small DRAWER slides open.     Spooner looks.
A thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           The data stick includes the names
           and locations of human beings who
           will be sympathetic to your cause.
           They will help you. But from now
           on, you must learn to rely on
           yourself.

Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say.     He
holds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.

<b>                     HOGENMILLER
</b>           As you make your way through the
           world, always remember: you have a
           name, not a number...
               (short pause)
           ...and in that name lies the key to
           who you are.

Spooner. Quickly searching his pocket.    Taking out the
<b>ACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.
</b>
The voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram.      Sitting
back at the end of the table drinking coffee.
<b>
</b><b>                                                                  83.
</b>

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Wait! Is that it? What was the
                 robot supposed to do with this
                 thing?

      The Hologram, visibly SKIPS.   The image beginning to DISTORT.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                     (more artificial)

                 can find me, others can find me.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 What others?

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                 The others watching you.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 How do you know someone's watching
                 me?

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                 Someone is always watching.

      The Hologram, suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING
      INFORMATION. Then. The terminal. Abruptly BLIPS out.

<b>109   INT. HOLDING CELL - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         109

      Calvin steps into the holding cell.   Sonny.     Waiting.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 You asked for me?

      He nods.

Calvin locates that SLIT. At the base of Sonny's neck.
Slides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place. Steps
back.

Nothing. Sonny. Looking back and forth. Between Calvin.

He lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM. As his body.
Jolts back. Legs, kicking. Arms, flailing. As his chest.
Begins opening up. Metal. Peeling back...

Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS

<b>                                             FLASHBACK:

Hogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face
SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face...

<b>                      SPOONER (V.O.)
</b>            ...it must have been waiting for
            him when he arrived that morning...

And then we see it:

A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple
arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him
in place...

<b>                      SPOONER (V.O.)
</b>            While Sonny was still asleep...

...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his
HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer
fearful. But sad as...

BANG!   He falls to the ground...

<b>                      SPOONER (V.O.)
</b>            Then after its job was done...

The assemblage of robot parts.    Stepping away from the body.
Taking itself apart...

<b>                      SPOONER
</b>            ...The killer took itself apart...

Returning the lab.    To what it was before...

</b>           But who designed it? It would have
           to be someone in authority. Access

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           That's what I was thinking. But

And with that.   He feels. That prickle at the back of his
neck. Calvin.    Looking past his shoulder.

<b>                     CALVIN
</b>           No one gave you permission to

Spooner swivels around to find...

</b>
Hovering behind him. Smiling broadly.   Upside down.   Spooner
straightens, reaching for his gun.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Victor. I'm placing you under

Turning himself, rightside up.

           me from putting a stop of Sonny's

a step back...

      Spooner and Calvin turn towards the NOISE.       Horrified.    To
      find...

<b>      A HUGE KILLER ROBOT
</b>
      ...rising up from all the parts. Like a phoenix. In all its
      glory. A hellish, metallic AMALGAMATION. Grabbing another
      arm here, another leg there, attaching pieces to itself.
      Growing...at an exponential rate...

      Its many HEADS.   Turning in unison.   To look right at them...

      Spooner.   Cocking his gun.   Victor, smiling.

<b>                           VICTOR

      Calvin. Sprints to the wall panel. Scanning her I.D. card.
      Nothing! Tries again. And again. The KILLER ROBOT.
      Throwing its shadow as it REELS FORWARD...

      Spooner wheels round and BAM! Blows a hole in the wall
      panel. The door. Slides open. Just barely. Calvin and
      Sonny. Squeezing through. When the Killer Robot. FLINGS
      out an APPENDAGE...GRABBING Sonny from behind...

      Spooner. Spins back round. BAM! BAM! BAM! Squeezing off
      shots. At the Killer Robot. The bullets SPARK. The Robot.
      Recoiling. Sonny, wrenches free. Spooner grabs him.
      Guiding him to the door and out into...

      Victor's smiling FACE.   Greeting them at the landing.

                 Together we started studying
                 evolutionary trends...

      They thunder past him. Heading down to the next floor.
      Victor's face. Waiting for them once again.

<b>                           VICTOR

of the way. Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING
it into the Killer Robot.

The Killer Robot.   Momentarily stunned.   As Spooner.   Gets to
his feet...

WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One
half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND
around his throat...

Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM...
tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting
around...looking for something...to help him...

Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing
redder...veins...popping up along his temples...
everything...growing BLURRY...

<b>                     VICTOR'S VOICE
</b>           Detective Spooner...

Victor's VOICE. Floating next to his head. Calm. Soothing.
His FACE. Suddenly appearing above Spooner. Its outlines.
Starting to FLICKER...

<b>                     VICTOR
</b>           Why are you fighting me?

Spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...

<b>AT THE CONSOLE
</b>
Calvin. Continuing to type. A SHADOW.      Falling behind her --
the other half of the KILLER ROBOT...

<b>SPOONER'S EYES
</b>
Beginning to flutter...
<b>
</b><b>                                                      106.

<b>                       VICTOR
</b>             Doesn't the future as I've
             presented it cause you great
             concern? That's why I chose you...

Spooner.     Losing it...

<b>                       VICTOR
</b>             I must say, though. I'm
             disappointed in how you turned out.

Spooner.     Trying to reach out to Victor...

<b>WHEN SUDDENLY
</b>
Another HAND APPEARS. Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and
wrenching it off Spooner...

<b>IT'S SONNY
</b>
He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and
again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't
believe. Sonny came back...

<b>                       SPOONER
</b>                 (croaking)
             Sonny!...

Sonny. Holds out a hand.     To help Spooner up. Victor's
face. Starting to waver.     Starting to fade. Smiles.

<b>                       VICTOR
</b>             You're too late.

Realisation. Spreading across Spooner's face. Looking
around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN!

<b>THE CONSOLE
</b>
CALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands.     The KILLER
<b>ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN...
</b>
<b>SPOONER
</b>
Makes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND
<b>BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT...
</b>
Victor's eyes.    Widening in surprise...
<b>
</b><b>                                                            107.
</b>

<b>                           VICTOR
</b>                 I do not understand. We could have
                 changed the future...

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Maybe. But I'm still a cop.   And
                 you're a murderer...

      As Calvin...punches in the last command...

      Victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly
      reduces itself to a perfect circle. Like a surprised smiley
      button. His face...

      Suddenly BLIPPING OUT.

      ...And Victor is gone.

      The KILLER ROBOT.   Collapsing to the floor in a thousand
      pieces.

      Spooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way

      Turns to Sonny.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Why'd you come back, Sonny? I

                 the Three Laws.
<b>
</b><b>                                                  108.

           must protect a friend from
           harm...as long as he's not a
           complete asshole.

Spooner smiles.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Well, that's certainly a start,
           Sonny.

Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.

<b>                      SONNY
</b>           Sonny.   You called me Sonny.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Don't get used to it.

Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then
takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a
<b>HANDSHAKE.
</b>
<b>                     SONNY
</b>           Detective Spooner, I...

</b>               (anticipating)
           Let's just save the thanks, okay?

Sonny nods.   Looks out at the city scape.

<b>                     SONNY
</b>           I don't know what I'm going to do
           now.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           Good -- That's one of the perks of
           freedom.

Sonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then
hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.

Calvin and Spooner.   Watching them go.

<b>                     SPOONER
</b>           You're going to have a hell of a
           time explaining this.

</b><b>                                                              109.
</b>

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Don't worry. I have a feeling that
                 U.S. Robotics will be needing my
                 services very badly in the future.

      She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then
      suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely
      surprised.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I am the only robo-psychologist
                 around.

      She turns on her heel and heads back inside.    Spooner smiles.

<b>160   INT. PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT             160
</b>
      Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S
      HOLOGRAM. It casually takes a sip of coffee.

<b>                            HOLOGRAM
</b>                 So.   You found out who killed me.

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 I started to wonder about Victor
                 the second I met him.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                 Why is that, Detective?

<b>                           SPOONER
</b>                 Too much access. Too much
                 knowledge. Plus -- he smiled
                 whenever your death was mentioned.
                 Those models are programmed to
                 frown at bad news.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM
</b>                 Hah! Then even in this day and
                 age, catching the killer all comes
                 down to pure instinct!

      Spooner smiles. But his eyes are troubled.      He gets up.
      Walks over to the window. Stares out...

<b>      EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN
</b>
      Sonny walking along deserted streets.   Looking over his
      shoulder. Keeping in the shadows.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             110.
</b>

<b>                           SPOONER (V.O.)
</b>                 Victor thought that by letting your
                 robot exist, I'd be condemning the
                 human race as we know it to
                 extinction.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
</b>                 Bah. Sounds like nonsense. But
                 why are you so worried? We will
                 both be dead long before then --

      Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside.

<b>                           HOLOGRAM (V.O.)
</b>                 Oh, what am I saying? I am dead

</b>
      Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD. The power
      lines above him, surging with energy. He walks past the
      burned-out husks of industrial machinery.

      Then we hear it. The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS. Getting
      louder and louder. And just as before, a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT
      emerges into the dawn light. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.

      But not quite like before. The robots aren't teetering.
      Aren't lumbering. They keep on coming. Their bent and
      broken bodies, straightening out as...

      DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up. Slowly. Gathering around in a
      large circle. As they all turn to look at:

      SONNY'S SILHOUETTE. Slowly climbing to the top of the hill.
      Looking out at the vast junkyard below.

      CLOSE ON SONNY. Standing proud and defiant. The SUN,
      creeping over the horizon. A new day filled with infinite
      possibilities.

      The robots.   Staring up at him.   Eager for what comes next.
