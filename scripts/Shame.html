    BRANDON SULLIVAN [early 30's] lies staring up caught in a
    disarray of sheets until-

    The PEEP PEEP PEEP of an alarm clock, from deep within a
    distant apartment.

    The MUFFLED PAD of FOOTSTEPS crossing overhead-

    BRANDON listens then gets up, pulls blinds and heads out
    towards the bathroom-

    The SOUND of his feet disappearing down a distant corridor.

    The MURMUR of an answer phone as we hear BRANDON peeing, in a
    far off bathroom.

    BRANDON stands, looking down, watching until-

    A SUDDEN breeze, the subway train oncoming-

    BRANDON boards.

    The doors GLIDE SHUT-

    BRANDON just visible through the window of the train, walking
    towards a distant seat.

    BRANDON   sits, eyes casually tracing over the faces in the
    crowded   train. A HOMELESS MAN sits, further along the car,
    haggard   and grey, and sleeping, the seat empty, either side
    of him.   He looks more like a pile of clothes.

    BRANDON turns back. The reflection of an PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL
    caught in the glass opposite.

    switched on.

    A HOMELESS MAN head lolling, sat alone at the end of a busy
    car.

    BRANDON considers, catching the eye of-

    A PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL seated opposite, the whisper of a smile,
    grazing her lips.

    BRANDON's eyes teasing over-

    The fall of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's hair-

    The dip in her collarbone-

    Her nail polish with French manicure-

    BRANDON looks at her. She looks away.

    BRANDON resumes staring. She looks back through the bodies
    of commuters. We see their eyes looking at each other.
    Their seduction continues through the collage of colors and
    bodies.

    BRANDON sits distracted, facing COLLEAGUE #1. MARIANNE
    [mid/late 20's] seated further along the table, steals a look
    at BRANDON.

    A glass door opens-

    The PRETTY ASSISTANT brings in coffee, sliding down a cup in
    front of BRANDON.

              you need to affect, growing more
              and more with a momentum that is
              unstoppable.

    BRANDON looks across the hall, distracted by the IT

     ALEXA continues slowly, tosses it aside, and continues taking
     off her bra and panties. Finally putting her earrings on the

</b>
     BRANDON in the shower, a sense of movement, his hand, barely
     visible, moving back and forth.

     The fall of the shower-

     BRANDON stands, letting the water wash over him.

     BRANDON sits, looking over at the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL sitting
     opposite-

     The train moves on, after a while stopping at another
     platform.

     PEOPLE get on, PEOPLE get off.

     BRANDON's eyes travel down over the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's legs
     and up-

     She opens them a little, the dip of her skirt, sinking deep
     between her thighs-
<b>                                  6.
</b>

     She looks up, senses BRANDON watching. She lets her fingers
     fall in her lap.

     BRANDON shifts a little in his seat to get a better look
     through the crowd. Suddenly she stands and makes her way to
     the train door. Hand reaching out and clenching a metal pole
     for stability, revealing a wedding ring.

     BRANDON's hand reaches for the pole too, touching her as he
     stands behind her. There is a gentle unison contact.
     BRANDON's breath, heavy on her neck. Both are frozen to the
     spot, caught in a mutual moment.

     The train door bolts open and the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL
     disembarks. BRANDON is blocked by a MALE PASSENGER as he gets
     out in quick pursuit of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL.

     BRANDON is several paces behind now, pursues. She turns left
     into a stairwell.

     It's almost like fighting a downward river. People are
     walking into his path as he struggles to keep pace with the
<b>     PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL.
</b>
     The tail of her coat vanishes at the top of the stairs. A
     moment later, BRANDON reaches the summit, to be greeted by a
     wrought-iron gate.

     He looks left at one staircase. People ascend.

     He looks right at another staircase. Other passengers ascend.

     People come in and out of the turnstiles on the right-hand
     side. He has lost her. A sudden moment of disappointment
     crosses his face.

     He descends the staircase, dejected.

     tracks, heart thumping-

     A bare space where BRANDON's computer once was and next to it
     a replacement computer. A pink fluffy gonk or the like stuck

     BRANDON hurries into the office area, unbuckling his coat as
     he does so. DAVID, phone pressed to his ear, mid way through

     BRANDON and DAVID enter a beautiful bar. A spectacular 180
     degree view of Manhattan. The room has the most elegant
     decor. It is to die for:

     Metropolis meets Blade Runner, a glittering New York skyline
     to the North of the room, the grey endless black of the
     Hudson River to the South.

     It surpasses DAVID's idea of classy.

     The murmur of conversation-

     The shake of cocktails mixed-

The COCKTAIL WAITRESS smiles, moving on, she's heard it all
before.

DAVID smiles, clocks BRANDON's look.

<b>                    DAVID

DAVID and BRANDON look around the room

DAVID and BRANDON are fortunate to be here. The clink of
glasses, the noise of laughter waft through the room.

Across the room, a familiar face.

Her wavering a little at first on seeing BRANDON across the
room. Their eyes lock.

She smiles, with quiet surprise-

BRANDON looks away, ignoring SISSY's gaze, not wanting to
look at her. SISSY plays on, inwardly crestfallen, her
fingers working across the piano keys.

DAVID leans back, eyes grazing over SISSY, a kind of white
noise to SISSY's beautiful music-

The seeping first bars of `New York New York' filtering
through-

<b>                    SISSY

          Start spreading the news. I'm
          leaving today. I want to be a part
          of it. New York..New York.

It's a familiar song but in SISSY's hands, every word
punctures like an emotional fireburst-

SISSY's voice is oddly haunting underscoring the bubble of
conversation,

<b>                    SISSY (CONT'D)
</b>              (singing)
          I want to wake up in a city that
          doesn't sleep. And find I'm king of
          the hill, top of the heap.

SISSY's eyes dart back to BRANDON, seemingly lost in his
conversation, but competing now with SISSY and her song-

<b>                    SISSY (CONT'D)
</b>              (singing)
          My little town blues-

Suddenly SISSY's fingers drop from the piano, her whole body
curving into the microphone offering a blues vocal acoustic,
slowly but quietly captivating-
<b>                              34.

Even DAVID's listening now-

<b>                    SISSY (CONT'D)
</b>              (singing)
          In old New York....

SISSY's up moving now, she is completely lost in the song and
the room is coming with her-


BRANDON concedes,looking back at SISSY, now holding the room.

<b>                    SISSY (CONT'D)

          I'll make it anywhere. It's up to
          you..New york, New york. New York,
          New York-

SISSY comes closer, walking between the tables, flirting and
laughing and drawing the audience in until they are in the
palm of her hand.

SISSY grazes past BRANDON's table, eyes catching on BRANDON,
singing for him now-

</b>              (singing)
          Top of the list, king
          of the hill-

BRANDON drinks, not looking at SISSY. She closes her eyes,
tears stinging, reeling back into herself-

<b>                    SISSY (CONT'D)
</b>              (singing)
          A number one...

SISSY draws out the note, bringing the song momentarily to a
silence-
<b>                               35.
</b>

SISSY's misty eyes open as BRANDON at last looks at her, the
moment oddly fragile between them, brutal and yet tender.
Even DAVID sensing something until-

<b>                    SISSY (CONT'D)
</b>              (singing)
          These little town blues-

SISSY turns, makes her way back to the piano, enjoying it now-

<b>                    SISSY (CONT'D)
</b>              (singing)
          Are melting away...

Fingers touching the keys once more, masterfully picking up
and improvising with the last few bars-

<b>                     SISSY (CONT'D)
</b>              (singing)
          I'm gonna make a brand new start of
          it - in old
          New York..

SISSY leans back. She is on fire now, singing with every
fibre of her heart and soul, like no other rendition heard.

<b>                    SISSY (CONT'D)
</b>              (singing)
          And if I can make it there, I'm
          gonna make it
          anywhere It's up to you-

SISSY holds BRANDON with a voice, a sudden flickering emotion
threatening to topple her, somehow in SISSY's hands this song
is heartbreaking...

<b>                      SISSY (CONT'D)

     BRANDON looks away, eyes filling with tears.

     BRANDON puts down his drink, blotting his coaster with the
     imprint of the deep red rim of his glass-

     He's the only one not applauding.

uncomfortable.

One of Sissy's sleeves rolls down to her elbow, as she
casually puts her hand under her chin, charmingly tilting her
head - revealing a cross stitch of scars, the trail of self
harm laced up her arm. DAVID noticies.

<b>                    DAVID (CONT'D)

SISSY sips her drink.

          It would be a lot cleaner and
          greener. It would be great for the
          city. Brandon, what do you think?

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Sounds great.

<b>                    DAVID
</b>          Yeah?

DAVID looks at BRANDON. BRANDON looks like he would rather be
anywhere than where he is now.

<b>                     DAVID (CONT'D)

     BRANDON wedged in the back of the cab, with DAVID and SISSY
     as they are lost eating one another's faces.

     Looking uncomfortable, BRANDON frequently takes glimpses in
     the rear view mirror.

     DAVID and SISSY continue making out. It's almost animal.

     BRANDON walks to his kitchen.

     HE hits the kitchen cabinet in frustration.

     He walks into the living area and paces.

     BRANDON considers, looking out through the window, he sits on
     the ledge, wringing his hands.

     BRANDON takes off his shoes and starts to undress. We hear
     SISSY and DAVID making love.

     BRANDON doesn't want to hear. BRANDON stands back against a
     wall, as if transfixed, as if he cannot take any more. His
     breathing is irregular. Something of the past has come to the
     present. All of his distractions have now stopped, and he is
     at once confronted with himself.

     His face bears the pain of something long passed, but
     visually present. This wound has not healed.

     Jolting himself out of his trance, BRANDON hurriedly heads
     out into the corridor-

     Pushing the glass doors open, BRANDON hesitates and presses a
     button on the iPod Nano on his arm. He stretches, zips his
     top, pulling his hood up.

     BRANDON slips his earphones on, moving off.

     BRANDON enters his apartment checking for noises.

     The sound of movement in the bathroom.

     He pushes open his bedroom door. It's like a murder scene.
     Pale blue sheets in disarray, the mattress nearly coming off
     the bed, sheets soaked with sweat and the smell of sex.

     A lone condom disregarded on the floor.

     We see his bedside drawer ajar.

     He walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut.

     on.

     SISSY enters. BRANDON opens his eyes, inwardly flinches.

     SISSY gets into the bed, covering herself with the white

BRANDON turns back.

     quietly considering.

               I do.

     MARIANNE is still standing, waiting. They look at each other.
     Eventually she turns and walks out.


<b>63   EXT. PIER. HUDSON RIVER. NIGHT.                              63
</b>
     BRANDON stands at the end of a long pier, looking out toward
     the Hudson River, the LAP of murky water, audible. He hovers
     for a moment, and considers, then slowly makes his way back
     to the main road.

     The glittering lights of Jersey stretching wide beyond.


<b>64   EXT. NEAR STANDARD HOTEL. NIGHT.                             64
</b>
     Above, the tall, endless glass of The Standard Hotel, scored
     with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny
     still lives.

     BRANDON comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans.
     Above him, engraved in stone is "1949." He looks up toward
     the tall building, which appears like a Stasi East Berlin
     building. Stark and authoritative.

     A KID slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor
     window, a FILIPINO NANNY ushers him away.

     A WOMAN, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans
     and t-shirt, paces along the window. Catching sight of
     BRANDON, she PULLS the curtain along the length of the glass.

     A MAN stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and
     jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up.

     A FEMALE CLEANER just visible lost in the monotony of
     cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy
     duster.

     And then BRANDON sees her-

     A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN stands, naked her body pressed against
     the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the Hudson
     River. The steady back and forth of the MIDDLE AGED MAN
     behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up
     fuck.
<b>                                    50.
</b>

     BRANDON hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his
     face as for a brief flickering moment BRANDON's eyes lock
     with the MIDDLE AGED WOMAN's dead gaze, standing high above-

<b>     A CAR HORN LOUD UNREMITTING-
</b>
     BRANDON turns, his hypnotism broken. It's as if he comes back
     to himself.


<b>65   EXT. STREET. NEAR RESTAURANT. NIGHT.                         65

     A distant restaurant illuminating a dimly lit street-

     MARIANNE waiting inside the bar, seated, with a drink,
     clearly there for some time. Her eyes checking the room, with
     quiet concern.

     BRANDON stands watching from a distance-

     BRANDON makes to cross, hovering on the edge of the gutter
     until-

</b>               Oh, yeah. I'm late. Sorry.

     BRANDON sits down at the table where MARIANNE is already
     seated.

menus.

<b>                       MARIANNE (UNDER)

</b>          I have few specials on the menu, if
          you'd like to hear them?

MARIANNE smiles, eyes darting to BRANDON, playful. The WAITER
oblivious, clearly on a roll.

<b>                       BRANDON
</b>          Sure.

<b>                    WAITER (O.S.)

          swordfish, tabbouleh and Moroccan
          Chermoula. It's really good. Er,

          Spitler New York Strip with a side
          order of fries and the salad is
          snow pea and radish with a cider

          with a sparkling water?

</b>          OK and the wine menu's right next
          to you. Yep. There you go-

BRANDON pulls out a wine menu hidden under his bread plate.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          You want some wine?

<b>                       MARIANNE

The WAITER hovers, points to a red on the menu-

</b>          The Pinot Noir is er..light..
          Erm.If you like it like.. Light.

The GLIDE of a napkin across BRANDON's lap, the WAITER a
constant presence, on the edge of irritating.

<b>                    WAITER
</b>          OK. I'll be back.

The WAITER smiles, at last moves off-

They sit looking at their menus.

BRANDON steals a moment, eyes tracing over-

MARIANNE's fingers playing with the edge of her menu-

The flutter of her lashes-

Nipples ghosting her dress.

An ring indent around her wedding finger, the shrink of skin.

The WAITER enters again, with water.

<b>                     MARIANNE

          Thank you.

<b>                    BRANDON

The WAITER returns-

          at this.

<b>                    MARIANNE

The WAITER scrawls it down on a pad, barely looking up.

<b>                      WAITER

</b>              (looking to MARIANNE)
          You want-?

MARIANNE shrugs, closes her menu.

<b>                      MARIANNE
</b>          I'm fine.

<b>                      BRANDON

</b>          Medium.

<b>                    WAITER
</b>          We recommend it pretty pink.

The WAITER waits-

BRANDON looks at MARIANNE, they giggle.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b><b>          OK.

The WAITER takes the menus. MARIANNE stares at BRANDON.

<b>                    WAITER (CONT'D)
</b>          Thank you. Excuse me.

The WAITER exits.

<b>                    BRANDON

</b>          No.

<b>                    MARIANNE

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          I don't know. Just er, it's just
          the way it is.

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          It's just the way it is. Yeah, I
          erm... actually, I'm separated.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Right.

The dip of skin, soft under her chin, a finger grazing over
it, nervously.

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          Yeah. Kind of a recent thing.
<b>                                 56.

<b>                      MARIANNE
</b>          No.

The WAITER returns.

<b>                    WAITER
</b>          Did we decide on the wine?

BRANDON hesitates, on the edge but-

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Erm, well, yeah erm.. The Pinot..
          Was it the Pinot Noir, you said?

BRANDON scours the wine menu at a loss-

BRANDON looks to MARIANNE, she shrugs-

<b>                    WAITER
</b>          Yeah, great..Great choice. OK.

The WAITER nods, at last moves off-

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          I wasn't married long. Gave it a
          shot. It didn't really work out.

<b>                      BRANDON
</b>          No.

<b>                      MARIANNE

<b>                    MARIANNE

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          ...averse to the whole idea.

<b>                     BRANDON
</b>          Well, yeah. I mean, I just don't
          understand why people would want to
          get married. Especially nowadays, I
          mean, it's.. You know.. I don't see
          the point.

<b>                    MARIANNE

</b>

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          It doesn't seem realistic.

MARIANNE considers, lips grazing the rim of the glass.

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          Are you serious? I mean..

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Yeah, I am, really.

<b>                    MARIANNE

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          The food's supposed to be really
          great here. (LAUGHS)

MARIANNE nods, doesn't look amused-


<b>                    BRANDON (CONT'D)
</b>          No, no, no, no. I'm not.. I'm not

          rest of your life? I mean, it's.. I
          mean, you know, you come to
          restaurants, you see couples
          sitting together and they don't
          even speak to one another. They
          don't have anything to say, they
          don't have anything.

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          They probably don't have to speak
          because they're connected.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Or they're just bored with one
          another.

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          Every..

The WAITER approaches, a bottle of wine in hand.

<b>                    WAITER (OVER)
</b>          Here we go.

The WAITER uncorks the wine.

</b>                  Erm..

     He pours a little into BRANDON's glass.

<b>                             MARIANNE
</b>                  Exactly.

     BRANDON gestures for the WAITER to pour.

<b>                            BRANDON
</b>                  Oh, that's.. you can pour.

<b>                             WAITER
</b>                  Sure.

     WAITER fills BRANDON's glass.

<b>                            BRANDON
</b>                  Four months.

     WAITER finishes pouring BRANDON's wine and starts filling
     MARIANNE's.

<b>                            MARIANNE
</b>                  You have to commit. You have to

<b>                            BRANDON
</b>                  I did.. (LAUGHS).. For four months.

<b>                            WAITER (UNDER)
</b>                  I'll leave the bottle.

     The WAITER slides the bottle down, moving off-

<b>                            MARIANNE
</b>                  For four months.


<b>67   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT. NIGHT.                      67

     A dirty grey street, brightened by the glow of BRANDON and
     MARIANNE seated inside the restaurant.


<b>68   EXT. STREET. NEAR RESTAURANT. NIGHT.                         68

     BRANDON and MARIANNE stand heady from the wine and a little
     awkward in the freezing cold-

     They walk-
<b>                                  59.
</b>

BRANDON sneaks a side glance, MARIANNE smiles. It's freezing.
They're breath and bodies steaming as they walk.

<b>                       MARIANNE
</b>          Thank you.



<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Look, touch that.

BRANDON bows, pointing to the back of his head.

<b>                       MARIANNE
</b>          Your head?

MARIANNE turns to touch BRANDON's head. As she does so, he
GROWLS at her, like a little dog.

<b>                       BRANDON
</b><b>          GRRRRRR.
</b>
MARIANNE shrieks.

They BOTH laugh.

<b>                    BRANDON (CONT'D)
</b>          (LAUGHS) Oh, no, no, no...

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          (LAUGHS) You're such a.. Weirdo.

She pushes him playfully.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          No, seriously, seriously. Touch it.

<b>                       MARIANNE
</b><b>          OK.
</b>
There's a massive knot on the back of his head.

</b>          Oh, my God.

<b>                    BRANDON

</b>          Yeah, what is it?

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          It's a remnant.

<b>                       MARIANNE
</b>          A remnant?
<b>                               60.
</b>

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Yeah, from the Neanderthals.
          There's only a few of us left since
          the homo sapiens took over.

<b>                    MARIANNE (OVER)
</b>          OK. Hmm.. That would explain the
          forehead.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          What's that supposed to mean?

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          `What's that supposed to mean?'

<b>                    BRANDON

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          (CHUCKLES) No, seriously, how did
          you get it?

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          (COUGHS) I used to play this game

</b>          Hm-hmm.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Where I would sit on his feet and
          he'd fly me through the air. I hit
          my head on the ceiling and I
          blacked out.

They both laugh. Marianne laughs hysterically. BRANDON laughs
along.

<b>                    BRANDON (CONT'D)
</b>          I was knocked out for 5-10 minutes.
          I peed my pants.

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          (Reacts Sympathetically) Oh.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          If you had a choice to live in the
          past or future and you could be
          anything you wanted, what would you
          be?

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          What would you be?

<b>                    BRANDON

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          Sixties is tough though. I saw
          GIMME SHELTER recently, you know
          the Rolling Stones documentary?

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          It kind of seemed like hell.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          What?

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          (LAUGHS) Yeah, the sixties would be
          the last place I'd want to be.

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          No way!

<b>                    MARIANNE
</b>          Yes. Eugh, chaos!

<b>                    BRANDON

          would you wanna be?

<b>                    MARIANNE

<b>                    MARIANNE

Still walking along, BRANDON thinks for a moment. BRANDON
turns and stares at MARIANNE, holding his gaze. MARIANNE
blushes. There's a silence as they walk on. They get to a
subway entrance.

<b>                    MARIANNE (CONT'D)
</b>          OK. Well, this is me.

BRANDON nods, hovers by the subway, awkward and yet-

<b>                    BRANDON
</b>          This is you.

They stand heady from the wine and a little awkward.
<b>                                      62.
</b>

<b>                           MARIANNE

<b>     SILENCE
</b>
     They loiter on the edge of something more.

<b>                           MARIANNE
</b>                 Right.

<b>     SILENCE
</b>
     BRANDON hovers, momentarily fragile, the sting of
     uncertainty. MARIANNE descends into the depths of the subway,
     with a half wave.

<b>                           BRANDON
</b>                 So, is that a yes?

</b>
     The CLICK of the door-

     BRANDON enters. The sound of the record player, which had
     finished hours ago, rotates empty on the turntable.

     Pulling off his jacket-

<b>                           BRANDON

<b>     SILENCE-
</b>
     BRANDON puts the needle back in it's dock. HE hangs up his
     jacket, takes his bag, heads towards the living room. He
     spies all SISSY's crap spilling out across the floor-

     He sighs.

     Heads to the kitchen and gets a can out of the fridge.


<b>70   INT. CORRIDOR. APARTMENT. NIGHT.                             70

     The lock of the front door rotates. Someone is entering the
     apartment.

     Darkness-

     SISSY bursts through the door, in a hurry.
<b>                                   63.

     After a moment the bathroom door opens, cutting a slit of
     light into the darkness.

     From the blackness we see BRANDON framed, masturbating in
     front of the bathroom sink.

     SISSY, shocked, stands with her hand still on the door
     handle, transfixed by a naked BRANDON.

     As BRANDON instinctively turns, SISSY runs from view.

     SISSY slams the door shut.

<b>                           BRANDON (O.S.)

</b>               (SNIGGERS) Fuck!

     BRANDON looks at himself in the mirror, full of shame and
     bewilderment and deep embarrassment.

     Slowly but surely these expressions turn into rage. He hits
     the wall in frustration.

<b>                           SISSY (CONT'D)

BRANDON's towel falls down as he forcefully pins her down.

     BRANDON lowers himself onto the floow, desperately struggling
     with his emotions-

     He closes his eyes, eyelashes fragile and flickering until-

     BRANDON opens them, reaches a hand out, almost mechanically,
     turns up the shower, the room now swirling in steam, trying
     to drown SISSY's voice out.

</b>
     SISSY walking back from kitchen, resigned-

     BRANDON's laptop on and open on his desk.

     SISSY approaches it, sinking down in front of the illuminated
     laptop.

     She absently taps the mouse, dragging open a series of held
     windows, the shifting lights of the screen cast across her
     face, revealing-

     Slowly SISSY's face changes, a blurred smorgasbord of porn
     sites, graphic and obscene, their colors reflecting across
     her face and body. An escalating collage of graphic images,
     obscene sexual messages and a provocative sexual conversation
     hanging mid sentence addressed to a live sex chatroom. The
     images haunting, brutal, from the weird to the
     sadomasochistic. The open windows, an endless stacking of
     obscene chatroom conversation, emails posted with graphic
     sexual photos and live webcam images of every combination of
     fucking disappearing into the screen in infinite form.

     SISSY is taken aback and strangely intrigued-

     Suddenly a voice from the screen, images briefly glimpsed, a
     woman legs splayed-

               Brandon's girlfriend? Do you want
               to play?

     SISSY looks closer, mildly appalled.

     BRANDON picks up the laptop and heads towards his bedroom.

     SISSY takes her coat and leaves the apartment.

<b>     LATER-
</b>
     The thump of music-

     BRANDON sitting on the edge of his bed, the pumping music
     from a stereo in the apartment seemingly getting louder,
     hands grasping his hair. Then suddenly he enters the whole
     contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag.

     Then, BRANDON moving like a dervish through the apartment, a
     black garbage bag in his hand, dumping pieces of paper, post
     it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone
     numbers on the back.

     BRANDON moves on, picking up anything he can find. An old
     jacket, elbows worn. A handful of old t-shirts.

     He moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy, grabbing
     more crap along the way, one of SISSY's dirty thongs on the
     floor. He picks it up, moving on.

     An open fridge-

     BRANDON tipping bowls of old food and long past it sell by
     date mush into the bag.

     Cans of Red Bull, crappy cereals, jam with mould on top, an
     old joint, magazines all get dumped on route.

     BRANDON heads out, picking up more detritus along the way,
     old pens, an old cellphone, a pair of defunked headphones-

     A pile of porn mags, in a cupboard, pulled out as he heads
     down along the corridor.

     BRANDON strips the room, pulling out an old pair of sneakers
     smelling and cracked from under a chair. He peers up, looks
     around the room almost bare-

     His laptop resting on his desk. BRANDON stops, considers,
     initially resistant and then something finally compels him to
     do it-

     He picks up the laptop, yanking the plug hard from the wall.
     Dumping it inside the garbage bag, he moves on picking up an
     ipod, a gameboy, ipod nano, wires and cables and stuff.
     Slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage, he drags the
     heaving bag of crap out into the corridor.

     The SLAM of the front door-


<b>77   EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE APARTMENT. NIGHT.                       77
</b>
     BRANDON heading down the steps of his apartment, heaving the
     swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on
     the sidewalk. A pile of black garbage bags already piled up
     along the street in waiting for collection.

     Further down the street a YOUNG COUPLE holds hands, walks by
     the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk.

     A SIREN goes past-

     The DISTANT banter of a GANG OF KIDS.

     BRANDON heads back up to his apartment, shutting the door
     firmly.

</b>
     BRANDON, now the voyeur, looks across the room, into
     MARIANNE's office. He studies her, almost like prey. The
     moment seems to last a lifetime. There is much want in
     BRANDON's face, but from this distance seems unobtainable.

     Suddenly, and without any warning, BRANDON walks into his
     dream, entering MARIANNE's office, and pulls her behind a
     partition, kissing her unapologetically and passionately.

     She responds, startled, but happy to be taken. She
     surrenders.

     They pull away, looking at one another. She smiles,
     laughing, his spirit infectious, drawing her on.

<b>                          BRANDON

     MARIANNE, both giggling and tripping.

     be guided and yet-

</b>               No, where are we going? (LAUGHS)

     BRANDON snorts two lines of coke in quick succession on top
     of the white water tank in the toilet.

     Exiting, we see MARIANNE looking out onto the Hudson from the
     large hotel window.


<b>81   INT. BEDROOM. STANDARD HOTEL. DAY.                         81

     BRANDON enters the bedroom, stopping to prepare a drink.
     Watching MARIANNE at the window.

<b>                         BRANDON
</b>               You wanna drink?

     He pours a drink from the mini bar.

<b>                         BRANDON (CONT'D)

<b>                         MARIANNE

     BRANDON approaches nervously, standing next to her.

<b>                          BRANDON
</b>               Hey.

     MARIANNE leans up and kisses BRANDON.

     MARIANNE takes BRANDON's hand and leads him to the bed. We
     see both of them slowly discovering each other through tender
     touches.

     MARIANNE caresses BRANDON's face and kisses both his eyes.
     BRANDON attempts to do the same to MARIANNE, slowly but
     surely. This ritual becomes more aroused, clothes start to
     fall away, revealing for the first time both each other's
     flesh.

     BRANDON rolls up her skirt, laughs at her panites. MARIANNE
     giggles.

<b>                         BRANDON
</b>               (LAUGHS) Are they vintage?

<b>                         MARIANNE
</b>               A little bit. (LAUGHS)

     The ritual begins to get more passionate, as they feel for
     each other's breasts and thighs.

     At the height of this passionate encounter, BRANDON's
     attention strangely, slowly starts to fade. It's as if the
     intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him.

     He recoils, unable to continue.

     Both lie on their backs silently, in frustration, breathing
     heavily. MARIANNE's face is one of puzzlement and hurt. She
     looks at BRANDON for some kind of answer. He gets up.
     MARIANNE, unsure what to do, sits up and pulls down her
     skirt, adjusts her hair.

     view.

</b>               Brandon? Erm...

     MARIANNE looks at him, the moment fragile. She does up her
     bra.

<b>                         MARIANNE (CONT'D)
</b>               You know, it's cool. It's OK.

     leave

     BRANDON looks back out over the grey of the Hudson River.
     BRANDON's face is one of embarrassment and failure.

     The CLICK of the door, MARIANNE gone.

     The HUM of the traffic, audible through an ajar window.

     BRANDON reaches his hand out, catching the breeze, peering
     down, a man on the edge.

     A cold sweat beading BRANDON's forehead as he comes, face
     twisted before the slow seep of release.

     BRANDON withdraws, laughs. The HOTEL LOVER laughs as well.

     BRANDON turns, for a moment she is almost beautiful.

     HOTEL LOVER smiles, already pulling on her underwear. BRANDON
     watches her, pulling on a tiny thong. She looks up, stares at
     him.

     BRANDON sits, drinks alone at the bar-

     An OLDER GUY paws a GAUNT YOUNG WOMAN plying her with drinks,
     knocking them back much to his delight.

               Brandon, it's Sissy.. I really need

     BRANDON pockets his phone.

     BRANDON stops and knocks on an apartment door. A woman opens
     and BRANDON steps in.

     A threesome. BRANDON has sex with a BLONDE and BRUNETTE.

     Throughout the images of the threesome, we hear more of
     SISSY's Voicemail.

     BRANDON, at climax, his animalistic grimace turns to pain and
     anguish.

      The grey snake of a subway coming up from under ground-

      BRANDON stands on a platform. It's not the rush hour yet.

      The RATTLE of the subway pulling in-

      BRANDON boards the train.

      A virtually empty car-

      BRANDON sits-

      A COLUMBIAN WOMAN across the car, head lent against the
      window, half asleep, clearly at the end of a long shift.

      Above a poster of a sunny shiny family advertising LIFE

      BRANDON's eyes graze over the poster-

      He stands his reflection mirrored back at him, preparing for
      his stop-

      The train SCREECHES to a sudden halt-

      Wheels SCREECHING along the track-

      The COLUMBIAN WOMAN wakes-

      A YOUNG STUDENT plugged headphone on, looks up from reading
      her book.

      BRANDON inwardly curses.

      The train sits in the station. Doors not opening.

      The silence at last punctured by the SHRILL hum of the
      intercom-

<b>                          INTERCOM

                Please follow the conductor to the
                rear of the train.

      The long low PING of the intercom fading out-

      They wait. And wait in silence.

      BRANDON leans his head against the glass, closes his eyes, a
      hangover kicking in.

      The other few commuters in the carriage sit awkwardly,
      wondering why the doors aren't opening in the station.
      Details of the carriage appear.

      Half-drunken cup of coffee.

      An old New York POST.

      Graffiti on all the car windows.

      They wait.

      Suddenly passengers from other carriages are making their way
      through the carriage that BRANDON's in, with the CONDUCTOR
      ushering the passengers to make their way down to the end.

      Passengers asking, "What's going on?"

      BRANDON finally makes his way down with the other passengers
      to the last carriage. As he steps out, he looks down to his
      far left and sees a POLICE CAUTION LINE being unraveled, and
      ENGINEERS and FIREMEN making their way to the far front of
      the train.

      BRANDON climbs the stairs, filing out of the subway, eyes
      catching on-

      A WOMAN's shoes, like Sissy's earlier at the Boom Boom Room,
      discarded. BRANDON picks up his pace.

      The intermittent WHIR of sirens-

      BRANDON emerging from the subway, already reaching for his
      cellphone-

      Beyond the glow of an ambulance-

      BRANDON keeps walking, heading off up the road quietly
      distracted. He taps the keys pressing the cellphone to his
      ear.

      The PULSE of a distant phone ringing-

      The answer machine kicks in-

      Exiting, BRANDON heads along the faceless corridor, reaching

      with relief, leaning his forehead against the bathroom door,
      letting himself exhale-

      SISSY sunk on the floor wedged between the bathroom and the
      toilet-

      The pump of blood seeping from her wrists, already pooled
      across the floor-

      BRANDON pushes the fat of his thumb on each slash, blood
      seeping between his fingers-

      BRANDON looks at her wrist, every time he moves his fingers,
      he releases the pressure the blood flows.

      BRANDON grips them tighter, a quiet determination to stop the
      bleeding-

      The skid of blood underfoot, BRANDON cradles her in his arms,
      grappling with his phone, desperately calling 911.

      BRANDON desperately holds her, cradled between his legs, his
      fingers pressing her wrists, temporarily stemming the flow of
      blood, the phone wedged between shoulder and chin.

      The slip of SISSY's wrist through BRANDON's fingers. He slams
      down the phone, struggling to hold her in his grasp. She
      slips again.

      SISSY lies, sleeping, skin white, strapped to a drip. The
      gentle rise and fall of her breath.

      BRANDON's gaze falling on SISSY lying in the hospital bed,
      her wrists bandaged.

      BRANDON, eyes falling on the scars covering her arms. He
      reaches out a hand, on the edge of touching them, letting his
      fingers hover over them until finally-

      A FINGER lightly outlines a snaking scar seeping up her arm.
      She stirs a little but-

      SISSY's eyes just opening, focusing on him until-

      BRANDON stands, a hangover kicking in-

      And at once BRANDON is crying, the tears flowing slow at
      first until they rush, like floodgates opening. He reaches
      for breath, trying to stifle the howls emanating from his
      body, inconsolable now, flooded with emotion-

      BRANDON sinks squat to the ground, buckled in two, body
      shuddering.

      The LAP of the water steady now-

      BRANDON sobs and sobs and sobs, a mess of snot and tears as
      he looks out over the wide sweep of the Hudson River.

      Far off the drone of the freeway, the early evening trawl of
      traffic kicking in-


      The froth of the tide back and forth, rising and breaking,
      back and forth.

      BRANDON stands in his familiar spot on the platform, waiting
      for the train that will take him to work. Wearing a vacant
      face, the train pulls into the station. BRANDON boards.

      He takes a seat automatically, as if pre-programmed. The
      train leaves the platform.

      Looking into no man's land, BRANDON feels the heat of
      someone's gaze. As he instinctively looks up to respond, a
      mixture of surprise, fear, excitement and doubt across his
      face.

      The PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL who we met at the beginning of our
      story is staring down at BRANDON, this time in a more
      engaging fashion. She looks because she wants to be looked
      at.

      Again, a dance begins. This time, she leads. Engaged, active,
      decisive.

      BRANDON's face is fractured into many conflicting emotions.
      It's as if a magnet is drawing him in, but at the same time
      he's trying to resist.

      At this moment, the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL stands up, eyeing
      BRANDON as she makes her way to the door, blocking BRANDON as
      the train pulls in to her stop.
