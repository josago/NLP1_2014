           and funny. He makes her laugh. They are best friends but it's
           clear that Jesse wishes they were more.

           It's a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon. Celeste
           and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to "Love Rhino," the song
           heard under the montage. Jesse drives while Celeste is on her
           Blackberry. Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a
           hooded sweatshirt. Celeste is wearing all black workout
           gear. She is always wearing all black.

          While Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored. He starts
          looking through the middle console. He finds something. A
          melted tube of Chapstick. Ew. Ooh, a cigarette. Jesse lights
          the cigarette, takes a drag. Celeste looks at Jesse and
          signals to him, "Can I have a drag?"

          Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He
          then looks at his teeth.

          Celeste just glares at him.

           They drive by "Urban Light," Chris Burden's installation at
           the entrance of LACMA. They are rows of restored street
           lamps. Celeste sneers.

           the deadstock vintage Italian

           for the guest room windows.
                         
           Celeste is truly touched by the gesture.

           watching the 2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo. He is watching a
           short feature about Olympian Matthias Steiner, a gold

           Jesse is on a date with Yogurt girl. It's clear he's hasn't
           been doing a lot of talking.

</b>           So I was in school but then I
           dropped out because I really wanted
           to work in fashion but it's really
           hard to find a paid internship? So
           I went back to school and now I
           work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm
           really looking to make money doing
           something I love? But I'm sure the
           universe is looking out for me and
           when the time is right, the right
           thing will come along, you know?

           Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the
           outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a
           woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door
           shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn't do that.
           Would he?

           Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats
           breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines.
           This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks'
           new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be.
           Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head,
           "yeah, I get it." She turns it off.
                         
           Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at
           the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally,
           a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He
           is alone. Phew.

          Celeste searches frantically for her book. She peeks around a
          corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading "More New
          Releases." Three copies of her book, "Shitegeist" appear in
          the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed.

          She grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the

          replaces the center display book with her own.

           anywhere for Beth. She's my best
           friend. And I'm so happy for her.
           Senior year of college, we had a
           tradition. Every Sunday, come rain
           or shine, Beth and Tucker would
           meet me and Jesse at the Bishop
           with a 12-pack of Miller High Life,
           the champagne of beers, and we
           would meet to talk about what was
           important in the world, you know,
           Heidegger's influence on hip-hop.
           Or the feminist duality on "Melrose
           Place." Life's big questions. Beth
           and Tucker were just friends then
           but there was always something
           there. Just an ease they had with
           each other. Jesse and I spent years
           trying to get them together,
           unsuccessfully.

           but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point
           pens. CELESTE'S LAWYER, male, 40, speaks:

           They've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           For never being the person I wanted

</b>           Well, who does? Do you love her?
                         
          Jesse looks at Celeste.
                         
<b>                          JESSE

<b>                          JESSE
</b>           Okay. Okay.
                         
          Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes.
                         
<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           God, I finally understand why you
           fucking cry all the time. Shit is
           emotional.
                         
          They share a laugh. Then, they sit in silence for a beat.
                         
                         
<b>           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           So...I guess we were right.
                         
<b>                          JESSE
</b>           Huh?
                         
          Celeste makes the "C and J" hand gesture from the high school
          photo in the opening montage. Jesse makes it back. They
          smile.
                         
<b>           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
</b>           I love you.
                         
          He kisses her on the lips. For the last time. And then, he's
          gone.

           Celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky.

           Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth.
                         
<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           Hey. So, you're probably giving
           your card to some girl in yoga
           right now. But if that doesn't work
           out for you...I think I may be
           ready. To beat you in Scrabble.

           Celeste runs in to pay for gas. She is on her Blackberry.

           Celeste stands in line with some gum and water. A young man
           blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water. Old
           Celeste returns for a moment.
                         
<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           Excuse me, sir?
                         
           The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she's no longer
           this person. She restrains herself.
                         
<b>           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
</b>           Nothing.
                         
           Celeste takes in how she has changed. She smiles a little.
           The young man turns back to her.
                         
<b>                          YOUNG MAN

           dog's in the car and he's really
           thirsty. So, thanks.
                         
<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           No problem.
                         
           She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.
