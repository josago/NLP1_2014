</b>

<b>           -EARLY APRIL, 1841-
</b>           We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A

<b>           FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.
</b>
           WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high
           end piece, but it is quite nice.

           WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair
           with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late
           twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,
           is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
           Someone who has known manual labor in his time.

           Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing
           the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to
           play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:

                         


<b>           INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</b>
           We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being
           thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In
           attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are
           FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women
           are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense
           that for the most part they are people of means.

           The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At
           the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
<b>           REEL.
</b>
           The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,
           having cut directly from the tune he was previously
           playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no
           way seems possessed with empty servitude.

           Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into
           enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal
           thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear
           that despite their respective races there is much
           admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.

                         


<b>           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
           It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is
           ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We
           see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and
           ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed
           kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,

</b>           she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if
           preparing to pose for a portrait.
           They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
           He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY
           stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,
           he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his
           greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and
           well and provided for. He goes to his children, and
           hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss
           on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.

                         


<b>           EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
           Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets
           and groves of Saratoga.

           The streets are well populated this morning with many
           people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are
           BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly
           easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
           We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their
           WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south
           and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are
           not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are
           well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" -
           comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.

           As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an
           intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart
           traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the
           muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for
           Solomon to help her across.

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           Solomon...
           Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile
           waving her forward:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Come, Anne. Jump.

           The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.

<b>                          ALONZO MARGARET
</b>           Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make
           it.

                         

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           I will not ruin my dress. Catch
           me!

           Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's
           still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne
           gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon
           replies.

                         

<b>                          (CONTINUED)
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I will catch you, Anne.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           I will.
           Again, lightly stern:

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           You will.

           And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,
           swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to
           the delighted applause of the children. That done,
           Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.

           As Solomon and his family make their way, among the
           slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
           As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon
           and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of
           this most handsome and harmonious group should be
           obvious.

           With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the
           STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
           Suddenly a voice barks out-

<b>           A VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           Jasper! Come on!

                         

<b>           INT. STORE - LATER
</b>
           We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man
           and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him

<b>                          WITH:
</b>
<b>                          SOLOMON

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.

           With money in hand the Northup children move quickly
           about the store looking for items to purchase.

           Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests

<b>                          TO SOLOMON:
</b>
<b>                          PARKER (CONT'D)
</b>           A new cravat, Solomon? Pure silk

</b>           We are in need of a fresh carry
           all for the Mrs's travels.

           Hill?

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           I am.
           Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL
           from an upper shelf.

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           Something to suit your style, but
           sturdy enough for the forty miles
           round trip.
           Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it.

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           It's beautiful.

</b>           At what price?

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           We will take it. Children, come
           see what your father has just
           purchased for me.
           As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the
           new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered
           the store.
           At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY
           HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the
           book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:

<b>                          PARKER
</b>           If you would sign our condolence
           book. My hope is to find a way to
           forward it to the Widow Harrison.
           Sad days for the nation.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris
           and her children. I hope brighter
           times ahead.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           No intrusion.
           Fitzgerald looks to Solomon. It is a cold glare as
           though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a
           response from a black man. Looking back to Parker:

<b>                          FITZGERALD

           meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a
           NEWSPAPER. He reads to his children solemn news of the
           funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President
           Harrison.

           We are just outside the Northup house. A CARRIAGE waits
           with a DRIVER. Anne and the children are dressed for
           travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL. The Driver
           loads bags into the carriage.
           For her parting gift, Anne gives her husband a kiss.

           Solomon is now out for a stroll. He passes two men - two
           in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR.
           MOON himself: MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON. Brown
           is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and
           intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair
           complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a
           bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes
           him, slightly effeminate.
           Moon, spotting Solomon:

           A decent though crowded, boisterous and smoke-filled
           joint. Very lively. Solomon, Hamilton and Brown are
           among several parties drinking in the hotel's bar. As
           with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes
           accessorize the background. Brown counts out $43.00 IN
           COIN on the tabletop. Solomon is astonished by the
           amount.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Forty-three dollars. All to you.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           That...it's far more than my wages
           amount to.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Consider the remainder an advance
           from the circus. I cannot tell
           you...I honestly wish you had seen
           the expression of our director
           when I described your abilities.
           He was fairly overcome with
           excitement.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           You should have invited him to sup
           with us.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           I did. I did, but so many
           preparations before the company is
           to depart.

           Solomon, a bit reluctantly, does the same.

           WE MAKE A HARD CUT to Solomon outside of the Pub, in an
           alley, with Brown and Hamilton in silhouette, back-lit by
           the street lights. He is violently ill, hunched over and
           retching horribly.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           That's all right Solomon. No

           Hamilton and Brown help Solomon to lumber up the spiral
           staircase, passing the occasional bemused guest.

                         

<b>          23 INT. GADSBY HOTEL/SOLOMON'S ROOM - NIGHT 23
</b>
           Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomon's bed, where
           a prone and reeling Solomon lays. Hamilton sits on the
           bed. As he strokes Solomon's sweaty face, Hamilton
           speaks sweetly.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           I'm afraid that Brown and I
           haven't brought you much luck.
           But rough waters bring smooth
           sailing. Eventually they do.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           ....So...so sorry...

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           Shhh. We won't hear it. We
           won't.

<b>                          BROWN
</b>           Let him sleep.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           Hmm. A good night's sleep. And
           tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel
           as well and refreshed as though
           the earth were new again.
           Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to
           Solomon for Brown's taste. With more than a bit of

<b>                          SIGNIFICATION:
</b>
<b>                          BROWN

           for him.

<b>                          HAMILTON
</b>           Such is the pity.
           Displaying an odd sort of disappointment, Hamilton slinks
           away from the bed. He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A
           CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than
           night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the
           dark and moans. His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE

</b>           Solomon stirs, then slowly awakes to his new
           circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless
           room about twelve feet square with walls of solid
           masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small
           window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only
           furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box
           stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are
           CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and
           his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But
           that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
           He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He
           does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails
           about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and
           beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams
           without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his
           flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
           After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,
           slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed
           state he remains.

<b>           INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING
</b>
           Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the
           door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter
           JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER
           RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.
           As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into
           the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to
           Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch

<b>                          ASKS:
</b>
<b>                          BURCH
</b>           Well, my boy, how yah feel now?
           Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he
           can put together he states what he considers to be fact:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I am Solomon Northup. I am a free
           man; a resident of Saratoga, New
           York. The residence also of my
           wife and children who are equally
           free. I have papers. You have no
           right whatsoever to detain me--

<b>                          BURCH
</b>           Yah not any--

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           And I promise you - I promise -
           upon my liberation I will have
           satisfaction for this wrong.

<b>                          BURCH
</b>           Resolve this. Produce your
           papers.

</b>
<b>                         25 CONTINUED: 25
</b>           With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his
           trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are
           empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his
           papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,
           but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will
           not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah no free man. And yah ain't
           from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.
           A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon
           and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man
           yielding. Burch says again:

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin'
           but a Georgia runaway.
           Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not
           in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare.
           The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,
           leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT

<b>           DISTINGUISH.
</b>           Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of
           "instruments:" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is
           about the size in circumference of two open hands, and
           bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also
           carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many
           strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the
           extremity of each. Burch says again:

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.
           Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say
           nothing of the kind.
           As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is
           pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his
           back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon
           down in a bent position.
           With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the
           back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no
           taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each
           blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND

<b>           BRUISES.
</b>           This beating continues on and on and on until quite
           literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.
           Dripping in sweat and panting:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           ...I...I insist...
           Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but
           rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to
           beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch
           returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows

<b>                          WITH:
</b>
<b>                          BURCH
</b>           Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave!
           Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until
           the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.
           Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,
           the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's
           arm tires before Solomon "breaks."

<b>                          BURCH (CONT'D)
</b>           Are yah slave?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           ...No...
           Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...

<b>           SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND
</b>           OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He
           pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough
           energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn
           lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's
           legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these
           gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one
           wrought with poor sincerity::

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           I seen a good many of the black
           kind just where yah're. Sick.
           Make me sick. Often times the
           situation was resolved, and I
           think; what was all the beatin'
           and abuse for? Things end as they
           should, and the violence was for
           naught. So why cause trouble when
           they ain't no cause for it? Be of
           a cooperative nature, and things
           don't need be particularly
           unpleasant.

</b>           Or, yah can carry on like yah
           been, and I fear yah won't live to
           see Sunday next.
           With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to
           rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling

</b>           on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain
           loosens none. Solomon calls out:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Help me! Someone help me!
           If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. Solomon
           continues his plaintive cry for assistance.

           beyond the space - THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the
           building, onto the city until clearly visible is the
           Nation's capital. It's icon's of freedom - the WHITE
           HOUSE, the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomon's
           captivity. Simultaneously, barren at the early hour and
           cluttered with litter and the remains of previous day's
           procession, the city is a bleak and forboding sight.

           It is a yard just beyond Burch's. The yard is hemmed in
           by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy.
           The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.
           He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years
           old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in
           education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.
           Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who
           answers to the name of Randall.
           Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.
           Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are
           all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is
           present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD
           WATER. He throws water on the naked men.

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           Go on. Warsh up.
           The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to
           scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them.

<b>                          RADBURN (CONT'D)
</b>           The boy, too. Get him clean.
           Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall.

<b>                          RADBURN (CONT'D)
</b>           Scrub now. Git 'em clean.
           Solomon scrubs harder. Randall - clearly cold and
           uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon.

<b>                          RANDALL
</b>           Do you know when my Mama will
           come?

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           Hush him up!
           Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to
           cry.

<b>                          RANDALL
</b>           Mama ..! Mama! Is she going to
           come?

</b>           Quiet, please.
           Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable.

           will, but you must be silent.
           Please. Be silent!
           On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall
           goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws
           water on the soapy men.

           Radburn brings food in to Solomon; a shriveled piece of
           meat and some water. Just barely enough to sustain
           Solomon. Radburn also has a SHIRT.

<b>                          RADBURN
</b>           That old thing of yours is just
           rags and tatters. Need something

           Solomon doesn't move for the clothing.

</b>           Go'won. Put it on.
           With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He
           removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was
           wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one
           Radburn brought him. The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty.
           Despite that, Radburn says:

<b>                          RADBURN (CONT'D)
</b>           There. Tha's fine. Tha's fine.

</b>           Yah keep bein' proper, yah'll see
           how things work out.
           Radburn starts to take the old shirt.

</b>           No! It was from my wife.

</b>           Rags and tatters. Rags and
           tatters.
           Taking the shirt, the "rags and tatters" as he calls
           them, Radburn exits, locking the door behind him.
           Solomon sits with the plate of food before him. He
           pushes the plate away rather than eat.

           and Solomon. Over time they have drawn trustworthy

</b>           Randall wanders about in the background. As usual, he
           calls out for his "Mama." By now, however, his calls
           should feel like little more than background noise.

           doesn't call out emptily. At the door to the yard is
           Burch along with two women. One in her late twenties;
           ELIZA. She is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her
           fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears."
           Though a slave, Eliza was a mistress and has - to this
           point - lived well. This is reflected in her airs and
           her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin
           color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's
           half sister.
           As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight,
           then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. Clearly
           this is mother and child being reunited.

           Eliza and her children. As the children rest, Eliza
           drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon
           who lends a sympathetic ear.

</b>           When I say I had my master's
           favor, you understand. Above even
           his own wife, I had it. Do you
           know that he built a house for me?
           Built it on the sole condition
           that I reside there with him. The
           added promise in time I would be
           emancipated. And for nine years
           he blessed me with every comfort
           and luxury in life.
           Displaying the finery she still wears:

</b>           Silks and jewels and even servants
           to wait upon us. Such was our
           life, and the life of this
           beautiful girl I bore for him.
           But Master Berry's daughter...she
           always looked at me with an unkind
           nature. She hated Emily no matter
           she and Emily were flesh of flesh.
           As Master Berry's health failed,
           she gained power in the household.
           Eventually, I was brought to the
           city on the false pretense of our
           free papers being executed. If I
           had known what waited; to be sent

           The slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark,
           dank hold among barrels and boxes of freight...and RATS.
           Burch comes around and "checks" the chains; makes sure
           they are all secure and locked.
           Satisfied, he heads up out of the hold. Radburn follows.
           Alone in the dark in the hold, John cries, as does Eliza.
           Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can, as if
           wishing bad things. As if wanting to exact some measure
           of revenge. But the greater insult is that Burch and
           Radburn, engaged in conversation, take no notice of
           Solomon whatsoever. He is that insignificant to them.
           That fact, that reality, makes Solomon boil with a rage
           he cannot express in words.

           enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked 
           vessel. 
           MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all, of various genders and 
           ages - are brought on board. Chief among them is ROBERT 
           who fights viciously with his captors. "With all haste" 
           is shoved down into the hold. 
           Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, 
           Burch and Radburn depart. They do so without a word 
           spoken to Solomon or the others. 
           With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the 
           crew again CASTS OFF, and the Orleans makes its way

           A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza. He bends 
           down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her 
           face. 
           Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. 
           From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt 
           the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back 
           at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the 
           hold. 
           As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand 
           between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand 
           to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says "No you 
           don't."

           There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor 
           and Robert, an impasse.

           erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of 
           incomprehension. 
           Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that 
           has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs.

           A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the

           overwhelmed by all that is happening around them.

</b>           Solomon is carted off along with the rest of "Burch's
           stock:" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon.
           As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it
           opens up to the frenzic, busy port.
           For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery.
           These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back
           in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage -
           herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain
           gang." Slaves are evident not merely by the color of
           their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are
           everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars -

<b>           THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT
</b>           UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks
           are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to
           elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.
           Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is
           attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and
           tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A

           being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of
           oppression in place.

           "Burch's stock:" arrive at Freeman's slave pen. They are
           led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto.
           The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with
           ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's.
           Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the
           pen.
           Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but
           downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to
           each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this
           new batch of arrivals. One attempts to speak, but all
           that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound.

           The slaves are in various states of undress, men and
           women alike. They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap
           and water. Women wash their hair. Men shave, skin is
           oiled. Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they
           primp themselves.

</b>
           It's an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and
           fairly ornate room within Freeman's house. CAPE PLAYS A
           PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman
           tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes
           less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his
           livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a
           good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better
           of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the
           slaves.
           The business has the air of an etiquette class, though
           what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into
           being more "sellable." He works with them in groups of
           five or so.

           Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Can you play a reel?

           him play, boy. Let's see what he
           can do.
           Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon.
           Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers
           stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he
           warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful.

           We come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY.
           CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all
           gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them,
           displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel.
           Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look
           smart" as he previously admonished them. They are made
           to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their
           hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what
           skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the
           slaves open their mouths and show their teeth.
           At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the
           side, stripped and inspected more minutely.
           One of them, John, is stripped and inspected.
           Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle.
           A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an
           attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list
           he's drawn up and asks of Freeman:

<b>                          FORD
</b>           What is the price for the ones
           Platt and Eliza?

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           A thousand for Platt; he is a
           nigger of talent. Seven hundred
           for Eliza. My fairest price.

</b>           As always, from you, Mr. Ford.
           Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be
           separated from her family. She begs of Ford:

           separate us.
           A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman
           and delivers coolly, eyeing Randall-

<b>                          BUYER
</b>           Your price for the child?

<b>                          FREEMAN
</b>           You see how fit the boy is. Like
           ripe fruit. He will grow into a
           fine beast.
           Randall is made to run, and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting
           his activity and his condition.

           He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet,
           counting out six hundred dollars, placing them into the
           already extended hand of Freeman.
           Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza; it visibly
           touches him. He now tries to buy EMILY to console her.

           not abate. IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS.

           traverse the Texas road between 
           the forest site and the sawmill in

           that path that gets a little 
           lightfooted, I will remind him 
           that on one side men and 
           bloodhounds patrol the border and 
           on the other the bayou provides a 
           hard living, with alligators and 
           little to eat or drink that won't 
           kill you. No slave has escaped 
           here with his life. You're here 
           to work niggers, so let's 
           commence. 
           Tibeats begins to sing the song "Run Nigger, Run" 
           mockingly. 
           We cut to Solomon chopping logs and into the montage of

           present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to
           them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by
           way of compassion.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           "But as touching the resurrection
           of the dead, have ye not read that
           which was spoken unto you by God,
           saying, I am the God of Abraham,
           and the God of Isaac, and the God
           of Jacob. God is not the God of
           the dead, but of the living. And
           when the multitude heard this,
           they were astonished at his
           doctrine. Then one of them, which
           was a lawyer, asked him a
           question, tempting him, and
           saying, Master, which is the
           great commandment in the law?
           Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt
           love the Lord thy God with all thy
           heart, and with all thy soul, and
           with all thy mind. This is the
           first and great commandment. And
           the second is like unto it, thou
           shalt love thy neighbor as
           thyself. On these two
           commandments hang all the law and
           the prophets."

           Standing in the middle of the road is a group of
           CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their "usual" dress of

           well the group share a smoke on a pipe.
           One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN

           guttural, sing-song noise.

</b>           WE HAVE A SERIES OF SCENES in which we see Solomon and a
           TEAM OF BLACKS working on the creek: CHOPPING TREES
           ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore... It's all just
           a trial for now. The work is diligent, but it is basic
           to this point. Still, under Solomon's direction, the
           slaves go at it like they've got something to prove. And
           rightly they do.
           Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with
           which he will transport the timber.
           Once this is constructed, HE PERSONALLY "SAILS" THEM UP

           Ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks
           just beyond the WORK AREA. All are expectant in their
           manner. A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon.
           Then, from up river, we see Solomon's raft of lumber
           winding its way. SLAVES CHEER, and Ford literally
           applauds the effort. Tibeats looks pissed. He has just
           been shown up after all.

           As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon
           with a fiddle. Not as grand as the one he previously
           owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less.
           It is a gift of thanks for his hard work. Solomon's
           gratitude is easily expressed.

           Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react.
           He remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years"
           is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now

           As the day gets on to mid-morning, the sun already baking
           in the sky, Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon. Even
           before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of
           belligerence; out of sorts and something less than sober.

</b>           Yes, master. I am about it. I
           have begun on the other side of
           the house.
           Tibeats walks around to look over Solomon's work. He is
           picayune, as if purposefully looking for fault.

           would get another size for you, if
           you wanted them when he came back
           from the field.
           Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it. Moving toward
           Solomon "with a great passion:"

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Goddamn yah! I thought yah knowed
           somethin'!
           Solomon, perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza, is in
           no mood for Tibeats.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I did as instructed. If there's
           something wrong, then its wrong

</b>           Yah black bastard! Yah goddman
           black bastard!
           In an inconsolable rage, Tibeats runs off to the piazza
           to fetch a whip.
           Solomon looks around. He is alone other than Rachel and
           Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses,
           runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's
           instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats
           marches back whip in hand.

<b>                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)

           With "concentrated vengeance," Tibeats springs for
           Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and

</b>           raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike
           the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar
           of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down,
           Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back
           with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A
           violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to
           Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches
           the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the
           handle again and again and again.

           swear it!
           Solomon ignores the threats, continues to beat Tibeats.
           Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeats's
           wriggling form. The stiff stock of the whip wraps around
           Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.
           Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and
           then pleas for mercy:

<b>                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)
</b>           Murder! It's murder! Lord, God,

</b>           Papa I'm sorry!
           Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard.
           Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more, then delivers
           a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the
           ground.

           it.
           Tibeats moves off toward, and then INTO THE HOUSE.
           Chapin follows. A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He
           looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.
           Anxiety mounts on his features.
           A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles
           his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to
           fetch him.
           Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is
           visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.
           Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off
           an air of impending trouble.

           Chapin runs off to join Rachel. The two converse at a
           distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log
           kitchen.
           Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is
           to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we
           continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the
           unexpected mounts.
           Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man,
           and he knows that death awaits him.

           watches, but does not move to Solomon.
           Solomon waits, and waits...
           WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and
           louder in the manner of rolling thunder. It's Tibeats.
           He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They
           carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.

<b>                          TIBEATS
</b>           Tha's the one. Tha's him.
           Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with
           perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon
           tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by
           TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same
           manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a
           cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back
           and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a
           peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of
           it intensely palpable.
           Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.
           Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the
           verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution,
           he begins to struggle and fight.
           A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over
           the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.
           He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the
           life is choked from him.
           With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing
           a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber
           "Holster" pistols with 9" barrels. Chapin moves with
           determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and
           matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't
           need to be much more demonstrative.

<b>                          CHAPIN
</b>           Gentlemen... Whoever moves that
           nigger another foot from where he
           stands is a dead man. I am
           overseer of this plantation seven
           years, and in the absence of
           William Ford, my duty is to
           protect his interests. Ford holds
           a mortgage on Platt of four
           hundred dollars. If you hang him,
           he loses his debt. Until that is

           Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols
           Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without
           further word, they mount their horses and ride away.
           Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.

           as Chapin's not sure what to do about Solomon. He
           chooses to do nothing. Solomon is left dangling by the
           neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the

           HOURS HAVE PASSED. The sun is now at its apex. The sight
           and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as
           Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was
           left. The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on
           the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the
           field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard.
           It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging
           even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this
           time and space.

           hands. Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and
           better assistance. And yet, he does nothing to alleviate
           Solomon's suffering. He heeds Tibeats words, and as
           though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a
           property dispute, he offers no further aid.
           Solomon's head lolls to one side. He looks toward the
           sun. The bright light flares off the leaves and branches
           of the tree from which Solomon hangs. The glare in
           Solomon's eyes offering him more pain than solace, but he
           cannot help but look upward. As he does, his eyes
           flutter between life and lifelessness...

           dry and parched. He may not die from hanging, but he may
           very well expire before the day is over.
           Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she
           were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of
           water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for
           him. She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the
           water which clings to his lips. Rachel then retreats,
           and leaves Solomon to hang.

           trailed by Sam, finally comes riding up. He dismounts,
           and moves swiftly over to Solomon. With great heartache:

           Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose. Solomon

           is in the foyer of the Ford house. As he gets his
           bearings, he looks around the interior. THE SPACE IS
           HANDSOME, AND WELL DECORATED. It is sharp contrast to

           From a study, Master Ford appears with a gun in hand. He
           goes to the door, opens it and looks outside. He can see
           nothing. Satisfied, Ford crosses back over to Solomon.
           He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           I believe Tibeats is skulkin'
           about the premises somewhere. He
           wants you dead, and he will
           attempt to have you so. It's no
           longer safe for you here. And I
           don't believe you will remain
           passive if Tibeats attacks. I
           have transferred my debt to Edwin
           Epps. He will take charge of you.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           (desperate, urgent)
           Master Ford, you must know; I am
           not a slave.

<b>                          FORD
</b>           I cannot hear that.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Before I came to you I was a
           freeman.

</b>           I am trying to save your life!
           And...I have a debt to be mindful
           of. That, now, is to Edwin Epps.
           He is a hard man. Prides himself
           on being a "nigger breaker." But
           truthfully I could find no others
           who would have you. You've made a
           reputation of yourself. Whatever
           your circumstances, you are an
           exceptional nigger, Platt. I fear
           no good will come of it.

           altogether. ABRAM; a tall, older slave of about sixty
           years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married
           to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD
           and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though
           in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She
           is the offspring of a "Guinea nigger," brought over to
           Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant
           sexuality.
           MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. She sits
           with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN. WITH
           THEM SHE IS VERY "MOTHERLY." We also see Epps's overseer
           TREACH. Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL.
           Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone
           of compassion with which Ford read.

<b>                          EPPS

           PATSEY, a 23 year old striking black woman. The camera
           moves out again to a wider shot. This reveals several
           lines of slaves picking cotton, with Patsey way out in
           the lead. 
           We cut to another pair of black hands. This time,
           revealing SOLOMON, clumsy and unskilled hands, picking
           cotton. A lash bears down on him.
           It is August, "cotton picking" season.
           We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom. It
           presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of
           light, new-fallen snow. The cotton grows from five to
           seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches

           There is a slave to each side of the row. They have a
           sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the
           mouth of the sack about breast high. Baskets are placed
           at the end of the furrows. Slaves dump their sacks of
           cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are
           again filled.

           Despite the heat, there is no stopping for water. The
           slaves are "driven" by Edward, who is himself "driven" by
           Treach.

           placed in the fire and baked. When it is "done brown"
           the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the

           Despite the lateness of the hour, the slaves are up and

           of the floor. They wait, poised like actors. Solomon
           strikes up a tune; Henry joins in with a pan flute and
           the slaves dance. They do so very wearily. The whole of

           Patsey. It should be quite clear that his primary
           motivation for holding dances is so that he may view
           Patsey twirl about the floor.
           This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps. A few moments of
           Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.
           Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all

           in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY
           AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop.
           The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first

           responds by playing.

           Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped 
           over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly 
           gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense 
           foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees 
           flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. 
           The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, 
           heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate.

           silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, 
           preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's 
           eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with 
           a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose 
           around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start 
           barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of 
           Solomon. Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation.

           Looking toward Patsey, speaking with great empathy:

</b>           I knowed what it like to be the

           they can get expressed with
           kindness or wit violence. A lusty
           visit in the night, or a
           visitation from the whip. And wit
           my experience, if'n I can give
           comfort, then comfort I give. And
           you take comfort, Patsey; the Good
           Lord will manage Epps. In His own
           time the Good Lord will manage dem
           all. Yes, Lordy, there's a day
           comin' that will burn as an oven.
           It comin' as sure as the Lord is
           just. When His will be done...the

           plantation class.
           Mistress Shaw turns her head to the side, catching a
           slave's attention. As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG
           WOMAN, commences to pour tea.
           As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip
           of her tea.

           as Patsey continues on. Playing up his "ignorance" of

<b>                          THE SITUATION:

           Epps grabs Solomon.

<b>                          EPPS
</b>           I'll cut your black throat.
           Solomon pulls away from Epps, RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE
           PROCESS. Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around
           the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,
           however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as
           speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.
           And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and
           suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely
           breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts
           up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.
           Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in
           what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after
           Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can
           even get close to the slave.
           Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:

           us carryin' on like this. Help me
           ta my feet, and let us both pray
           to the Lord for forgiveness.
           Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon
           moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within
           striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases
           Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more
           drops down. And again offering a treaty:

<b>                          EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm all done in, Platt. I have

           but in the name of valor, help yer
           master to his feet.
           Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is
           attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is
           too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and
           chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE

           Patsey from where she'd taken

           returning, Master Epps believed
           Patsey and me to be in
           conversation when we were not. I
           tried to explain, but it lead to

<b>           -AUGUST, 1844-
</b>           With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
           working the field picking cotton. As before THEY SING A
           SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the
           tedium at hand.
           But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry
           begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse
           right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note,
           none move to help him. None dare.
           From Treach rather matter of factly:

<b>                          TREACH
</b>           Get him water.
           Edward runs to fetch a gourd. He carries it to Henry,

<b>           DUMPS THE WATER ON HIM, BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY
</b>
<b>           ANYTHING TO DRINK.
</b>           Roused, Henry rights himself.

<b>                          EDWARD
</b>           Go'won. Git up.
           Unsteadily, Henry lifts himself and goes back to picking
           cotton. He joins in again with the spiritual, as if the
           song is all that can keep him going.

           Epps remains quietly focused on Patsey. And it's clear
           from her apprehensive expression just what it is he's
           come looking for. This time there is no escaping it. As
           if to acknowledge the badness to come, Phebe lightly
           cries.

</b>
           On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house -
           Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his
           manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and
           clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape
           and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.
           Patsey does not respond in any way other than to
           continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain
           as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is
           vicious with her passive aggressiveness.
           Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw
           had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to
           violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response
           from her. When that fails, he punches her which only
           leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey
           MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,
           Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep
           breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left
           him.
           Epps heads from the field. Patsey is left where she is.

           Solomon is making his way back to the Epps plantation.
           He carries with him a sack filled with the goods from the
           store. As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When
           he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens
           it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he
           folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up
           the sack and continues on his way.

           Solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his
           fiddle. Perhaps the safest place he can think of. He
           acts as though he's hiding away found gold. In reality
           it's more than that. For Solomon the paper is a first
           step toward freedom.

           quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding
           his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to
           dance.
           Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked
           pastries. She sets them down on a table.

<b>                          MISTRESS EPPS
</b>           A moment from the dancing. Come
           sample what I baked for y'all.
           The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food,
           file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "Thank you,
           Mistress." As Patsey moves toward the pastries:

<b>           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           There'll be none for you, Patsey.
           Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness,
           however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming:

<b>           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)
</b>           Yah see that? Did yah see the
           look of insolence she give me?

           in bloom was a carpet of white, it is now patchy and
           under grown.
           The slaves move through the field picking not cotton, but
           rather COTTON WORMS from the plants. The cotton worms
           have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop.
           We see the cotton worms in extreme close-up, moving among

           his life has reached its very lowest point. The odds of
           survival are slight, let alone the chance of actually
           ever returning to his family. This clearly weighs on him

           divided into THREE GANGS. The first which draw the cane,
           the next lay the cane in the drill, the last then hoe the
           rows after.
           Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts, and he moves
           with speed and skill. Certainly more so than he
           displayed picking cotton.
           Standing with his overseer, Judge Turner watches.

           Again, the slaves have been herded into the shack and
           pressed together.
           As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible -
           Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman, ANNA.
           She is awake. For a few beats she avoids eye contact
           with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be
           unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened
           by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes
           no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.
           Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely
           stand to face. Fear, proximity... They drive her hand

</b>           SOLOMON'S HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST. Solomon
           tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.
           Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her
           breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -
           really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE

<b>           ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,
</b>

</b>
<b>           AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE
</b>
<b>           SOLOMON.
</b>           The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to
           Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER
           DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more
           compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO
           MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more
           perfunctory than passionate.
           We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual
           release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous
           sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against
           reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that
           remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.
           And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna
           turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is
           as though the act had not happened at all.

           The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink.

</b>           This time, there is no dog. Instead, from the dark and
           the brush step TWO BLACK MEN. Solomon stands. He looks
           the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves
           covered in dirt. It becomes quite clear they are not
           just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly
           toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.
           At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money.
           Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE.
           Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is
           attacked, TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM. Solomon fights back,
           PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the
           head. That takes the fight out of him, and both men
           retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be.

<b>           -FEBRUARY/MARCH, 1847-
</b>           Alone out on the edge of the Bayou, Solomon is playing a
           low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON.
           As he plays, something appears in the distance. From the
           edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen
           from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of
           about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.

<b>           "IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER
</b>           FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD." Beyond
           that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.
           Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.
           Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt.
           It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in
           her dress.
           Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As
           Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite

<b>                          PLAINLY:

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           I'm hungry.
           Solomon gives Celeste some of his food. Celeste,
           famished, devours it.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           What is your name?

           dem and Celeste, and dey won't
           mind the devilish orders of the

           Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws.

<b>                          CELESTE (CONT'D)
</b>           Do you believe me?

</b>           Why?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           There are some whose tracks the
           hounds will refuse to follow.

<b>                          CELESTE
</b>           Give me more food. I'm starvin'.

</b>           Give it to me.
           Almost as if compelled, Solomon does as ordered. As she
           eats, Celeste aggrandizes herself:

<b>                          CELESTE (CONT'D)
</b>           Most slaves escape at night. The
           overseers are alert for such
           chicanes. But Celeste tricked dem
           'n alight in the middle of the day
           wit the sun up at its highest.
           The place of my concealment now
           deep in the swamp, not half a mile
           from Massa's plantation, and a
           world apart. A world a tall
           trees whose long arms make fo' a
           canopy so dense dey keep away even
           the beams of the sun. It twilight
           always in Celeste's world, even in
           the brightest day. I will live
           there, and I will live freely.
           The overseers are a cowardly lot.
           Dey will not go where their dogs
           show fear and where it always be
           night. Others will join me in the
           twilight, and we ain't gunna be

           Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed.
           Dried and smoked meats are hung, and milled corn is
           about. Taking out a handkerchief, Solomon begins to load
           it with food. Not too much. Not so much his thievery
           will be readily noticed, but he does avail himself.

           Solomon plays his violin, but plays it with an anxious
           nature as he waits.
           Then, as before, a figure appears in the distance. It is
           Celeste coming out of the night. She makes her way
           directly to Solomon. With no greeting, she says:

</b>           I am hungry.
           Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief he's filled. She
           opens it, and begins to devour the food. As she eats:

<b>                          CELESTE (CONT'D)

           As if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more
           Celeste departs toward the swamp. Solomon starts on into
           the swamp after her.

           Nothing. No answer. Not a human one. There are sounds
           and echoes - some in the distance, some perhaps moving
           closer - which, moment by moment, become more and more
           frightening. Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite
           literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then
           neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to
           guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to
           crumble. He thrashes in the water trying to find his way

</b>           Celeste! Come to me, Celeste!
           In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly
           done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this
           is his final moment. His panic should be that tangible.
           It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or
           maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he
           reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. Hauling
           himself onto the swamps edge, Solomon finally collapses
           in a drenched, worn heap. His life spared, but Celeste
           never to be seen again.

<b>           -MAY/JUNE, 1847-
</b>           We come up now outside of Master Epps's plantation. Epps
           stands in the drive. He's in surprisingly good spirits
           as Solomon, Uncle Abram, Henry and Bob trudge their way
           wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are
           gathered.
           The cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully
           returned.

           Joyous! Joyous indeed!
           Throughout Epps's welcome, Solomon's focus is on Patsey
           who is lined up with the other slaves. SHE IS NOW MORE
           HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER. Her face and arms
           display many new scars. It's clear that in the
           intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping
           boy for Epps and the Mistress.

           lacked for a grandiose component,
           though I will admit they have at
           times been short on ingenuity.

           more than any other in the field.
           I worked plantations from
           Virginia, down into Alabama. I
           could manage easy a hundred slaves
           and have done so. But to toil in

           would come to pass. Never. But

           A female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to
           sing solo, "Went down to the river Jordan." A response of
           "Oh Yeah" quickly follows. Again the singer continues,
           "where John baptized three."
           The same faces we have seen on Epps' plantation, but now
           filled with rapture, appear. It's as if the voices have
           created a new form of awakening and presence. It seems to
           transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. A joy
           which has un-yet been seen on screen. A joy which has
           been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. It's
           captivating, infectious.
           This should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the
           audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the
           seemingly chastising environment.
           The singer continues, "Well some say John was a Baptist,
           some say John was a Jew, but I say John was a preacher,
           because the Bible says so too, preach on Johnny." And
           with that, the rest of the congregation chant "I believe.
           Oh, I believe."

           ask only that you deposit a letter
           in the Marksville post office.
           And that you keep the action an
           inviolable secret forever. The
           details of the letter are of no

           would be an imposition of much

           Solomon and the slaves pick cotton. Armsby is
           conspicuously NOT laboring in the field. As Solomon
           works he is watched by Epps. Watched more than he
           normally is. For a moment it seems it might just be a
           matter of perspective; Solomon's unease over his actions.
           But soon Epps is joined by Armsby. The two men stand and
           talk, their looks locked toward Solomon.
           Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues
           for a long, long moment. But Epps makes no move toward
           Solomon. Solomon continues with his work.

           The slaves are at rest. Gripping his whip Epps enters,

           there's curiosity; is he there for a dance, for
           Patsey...?

           says nothing, but his directive is clear: Follow me.

           Solomon comes out into the dark. Nearly hidden in the
           shadows is a bitter Epps. Despite the lack of light,
           Epps's malevolence is quite clear. His whip attached to
           his hip. As he speaks, he stokes himself with swigs from
           a FLASK.
           Epps puts his arm around Solomon, as if consoling a
           friend, and guides him into the woods.

           believe we're all going to run
           away and then he thinks you'll
           hire an overseer to watch us. He
           believes you are soft soap. He's

           Increasingly it become apparent that, shallow minded and
           equally soused, Solomon has been able to fold Epps's

           It's the Sabbath. The slaves are left to themselves to
           do their own chores. At the moment the female slaves are
           washing their clothes in large cauldrons, slapping their
           clothes against washing boards and hanging them up to dry
           near to their living quarters behind the plantation. It

           The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and

           then her eyes close again.

<b>                          EVENING
</b>
<b>           -APRIL, 1852-
</b>           Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the
           extension. From the amount of work that's been done on
           it, it should be obvious that days have now passed.
           Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass. As casually
           as he can he inquires:

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Master Bass, I want to ask you
           what part of the country you came
           from?

<b>                          BASS
</b>           No part of this land. I was born
           in Canada. Now guess where that
           is.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Oh, I know where Canada is. I
           have been there myself.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           Have you?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Montreal and Kingston and
           Queenston and a great many places.
           And I have been in York state,
           too. Buffalo and Rochester and
           Albany, and can tell you the names
           of the villages on the Erie canal
           and the Champlain canal.
           Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           Well traveled for a slave. How
           came you here?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Master Bass, if justice had been
           done I never would have been here.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           How's this? Tell me all about it.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           I am afraid to tell you, though I
           don't believe you would tell
           Master Epps if I should.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           Every word you speak is a profound
           secret.

           before? Prior to Solomon stating his case, WE FADE TO:

           Hours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps
           has told in the intervening.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           How many years all told?

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Just nearly...just passed eleven.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           Your story is...it is amazing, and
           in no good way.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           Do you believe, sir, in justice as
           you have said?

<b>                          BASS
</b>           I do.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           That slavery is an evil that
           should befall none?

<b>                          BASS
</b>           I believe so.

<b>                          SOLOMON
</b>           If you truly do, I would ask...I
           would beg that you write my
           friends in the north, acquainting
           them with my situation and
           beseeching them to forward free
           papers, or take such steps as they
           might consider proper to secure my
           release.
           Bass looks at Solomon, holding his gaze for more than a
           prolonged beat.

<b>                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)
</b>           My daughter Margaret is possibly
           now 19 and my son Alonzo, 16. I
           miss them so. It would be an
           unspeakable happiness to clasp my
           wife and my family again.
           Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and
           looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the
           conversation by work. They both lift it toward the
           floorboards. Finally Bass speaks.

           Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon
           immediately hands over.

<b>                          BASS (CONT'D)
</b>           But that was a long, long time
           ago. I've been traveling this
           country for the best part of
           twenty years. My freedom is
           everything. The fact that I can
           walk out of here tomorrow gives me
           most pleasure. I see the aching in
           your eyes, the pain of not being
           attached to your loved ones. My
           life doesn't mean much to anyone,
           but it seems your life means a lot
           to a lot of people. What you have
           just said to me scares me, and I
           must say, sir, I am afraid. Not
           just for you, but for me.
           They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.
           Solomon, slightly confused.

</b>           I will write your letter sir, for
           if I could bring freedom to you,
           it will be more than a pleasure.
           It will be a duty. Now, would you
           be so kind as to pass me those
           nails, sir.
           We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the
           unfinished structure. They continue to work, as if the
           conversation had never occurred.

           Solomon walks a path he has walked a thousand times or
           more on his way back from Bartholomew's - sack familiarly
           slung over his right shoulder. Drearily he walks. His
           eyes acknowledge something we yet cannot see to his left.
           Almost simultaneously, his eyes retract back to the path

</b>           To a now virtually complete, half-painted white gazebo.
           Slaves continue to work on it. As they do so, Bass peels
           away from the structure to have an overview. He beckons
           Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who
           are continuing to work on the gazebo. As Solomon
           approaches, Bass shouts-

<b>                          BASS
</b>           And bring those markers!
           Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and
           approaches Bass.

           earth.

<b>                          BASS
</b>           I have inquired thoroughly. More
           than is safe for either of us.
           Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground,
           improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.

           each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how
           greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,
           we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The
           moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither
           man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment
           longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his
           way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.
           Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.

           Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in
           hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on
           something that is a million miles away.
           Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg
           tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound
           is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as
           if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the
           breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
           He then repeats the action.
           Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb
           and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it
           at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it
           from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the
           ground.
           He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it
           falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small
           bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of
           violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in
           an odd way, respectful.

</b>           Not claims. I have no doubts.
           This is Solomon Northup, a
           resident of Saratoga Springs, NY.

           courts. Your decision.
           By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome
           their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered
           in the yard as witnesses. They stand behind the cabin,
           out of sight of Epps.
           Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda
           next to her house slave. Her face is of a strange mixed
           emotion.
           Epps looks to Solomon. Solomon icily, stoically holds
           his ground. He makes it quite clear in his countenance
           that nobody owns him. Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there
           to back Solomon up. Epps, with no other recourse than to

           here.
           Epps walks back into the plantation.
           The trio starts for the carriage. Solomon is pulled back
           by the call of Patsey's voice:

<b>                          PATSEY
</b>           Platt...
           Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.
           Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to
           engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around
           Solomon and they embrace.
           Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.
           Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he
           rides off furiously.
           Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps:

</b>           Solomon...if we know what's wise,
           we should depart.
           A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They
           separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and
           Parker alight. The Sheriff chides the horses and they

           ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining
           state, the other slaves around her.
           WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further
           from the slaves - who are diminished by distance.
           Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a
           bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes
           forever more.

</b>           We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have
           seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon,
           aged significantly since then, stands nervously,
           swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and
           holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A
           tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he
           wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and
           looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places
           his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently-

<b>                          PARKER

           Solomon swallows and nods.

<b>           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - LATER

           THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon
           behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the
           Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and
           Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A
           BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family
           waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.
           Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the
           body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They
           are, after all - after twelve years - little more than
           familiar strangers.

           have had a difficult time of
           things these past many years.
           Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as
           much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his

</b>           And this is your grandson.

           The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming.
           Solomon breaks down. Emotionally, physically... But
           ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM. As she holds him, Solomon
           says to Anne with all his heart:

</b>           Forgive me.

<b>                          ANNE
</b>           There is nothing to forgive.
           The pair, joined now by the whole family, hold on to each
           other for life...and one would think for all the rest of
           their lives.

           eventually dismissed.
           Northup spent the rest of his life working as an
           abolitionist, and with the Underground Railroad.
           Solomon Northup most likely died between 1863 and 1875.
           The exact date, place, and circumstances of his death
           remain unknown.
