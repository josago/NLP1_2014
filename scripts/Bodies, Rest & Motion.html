               BETH WALKER is driving. She looks younger, but she's twenty-
               eight. She has a strong face and flashing intelligent eyes. 
               She's wearing a WAITRESS UNIFORM from Friendly's. She's deep 
               in thought.

               Beth pulls up to stoplight and stops.

               SOUND: A gentle toot of car horn.

               Beth looks up, startled.

<b>               BETH'S POV

               SID, a pleasant looking twenty-four year old, is in a pick-
               up truck next to her. He smiles and points up toward the 
               traffic light.

               She looks up toward the traffic light.

               They're red except for one with a lit green arrow.

               She pantomimes that she's in the wrong lane and wants to go 
               straight.

               Sid pantomimes that he'll let her cut in front of him.

               SOUND: Horns honk impatiently.

               Beth pulls away in front of the pick-up truck. The HONKING 
               continues. Sid looks back at the honking car, cheerfully 
               waves to it.

               A tiny well-kept Spanish style home in lower middle class 
               residential section.

<b>               INT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               It's neat and smartly furnished -- discount Swedish modern, 
               framed deco posters, some nice plants. The only problem is 
               it seems a little more like a well-designed waiting room 
               than a home.

               There's an empty ice bucket, several empty liquor bottles, 
               and a swinging metal ball thingabobby on a chrome and glass 
               coffee table in front of leather sofa.

               CAROL AND NICK are curled up together on the sofa, drinks in 
               hand.

               They're both in their late twenties. Carol's dressed in the 
               casually stylish clothes worn by women who work in shopping 
               mall boutiques.

               Nick's clothes are frumpled, a knit tie loose around his 
               neck. They've achieved a state of contemplative drunkenness.

               Carol sips her drink. Nick sips his drink. Carol sips her 
               drink. Nick brings his glass to his lips, hesitates...

               It's small, prefab, and tidy. It has a counter with shutters 
               that open onto the living room. Nick is kneeling, going

               Nick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty 
               bottle in the trash. He begins to pace. Carol shuts the 
               cabinet and follows him with her gaze.

               As Nick speaks, he gestures grandly with his drink, liquor

               The coffee-maker clock hits nine o'clock. The coffee maker 
               clicks on with a rattle. Steam starts to spew out.

               The coffee-maker makes horrible gurgling sounds.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               The kitchen is small and a little grimy, its furnishings 
               fatigued.

               Nick stares at the coffee-maker in disbelief. He's dressed 
               in a dress shirt, untied necktie, and slacks. He's carrying 
               a sportscoat with a Sears' employee name-tag attached.

               Beth walks into the kitchen, wearing a robe and carrying the

                         Don't wanna be late on my last day.

               He kisses Beth, surprising her. He presses against her. He 
               takes the donut from her hand and takes a bite.

               Beth kisses Nick, his mouth still full of donut.

<b>               EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - MORNING
</b>
               About hundred cars dot the vast parking lot.

               Nick swings into a parking spot and gets out of the car. He 
               tosses his jacket on the roof and crouches, tieing his necktie 
               using the car's outside mirror.

<b>               CLOSE-UP - NEWSPAPER
</b>
               The front page of the Phoenix Sun-Times -- the headline reads 
               "Misery Index Soars".

               Beth's hand comes INTO FRAME and crumples the page.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
               Beth stuffs the paper in a glass and wraps the glass in 
               another piece. She's sitting on the floor, surrounded by 
               dishes, newspaper, and cardboard liquor boxes. She adds the 
               wrapped glass to a box.

               She hears the SOUND of a CAR DOOR SLAMMING, looks up, then 
               returns to her packing. She reaches behind herself into the 
               trash, pulls out the blender, and begins to wrap it.

               At the SOUND of the FRONT DOOR opening, followed by a curious 
               METALLIC CLUNKING, she stands and hurries through the swinging 
               door to the living room.

<b>               INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               The living room is sparsely furnished -- a sofa, a coffee 
               table, a bookcase cluttered with a handful of paperbooks, a 
               couple of boardgames, a dying cactus, etc. A crappy old 
               fifteen inch t.v. on a t.v. tray. WE SEE this for a moment 
               before...

               A paint-splattered cloth is unfurled FILLING THE SCREEN.

               It gently floats down, revealing a PAINTER and his shopping 
               cart overloaded with supplies. He's dressed in paint-
               splattered clothes. A paint-splattered Red Sox cap is pulled 
               low over his eyes, obscuring his face.

               Beth stares in disbelief. Without seeing her, the painter 
               backs up, his attention focused on spreading the dropcloth.

               The painter looks up from the drop-cloth, ready to deal with 
               this obstacle. He freezes. His face lights up.

               It's Sid.

               Beth stares in agitated disbelief.

               With his untaken extended hand, he pulls a long strip of 
               masking tape from a roll around his wrist, masking one side 
               of the door frame from top to bottom.

               He stands on his tiptoes and puts a strip of masking tape on 
               the top edge of the doorframe.

                         used masking tape to mask?

               He tears the tape off the roll and sticks it to the top of 
               the baseboard in one corner.

               Crouched, he waddles across the room toward Beth, applying 
               the masking tape to the baseboard. He gets to Beth, stands 
               up, takes the tape off her fingers, and presses it into place.

               She circles it. Nick's finger ENTERS FRAME.

               Carol circles Billings. Nick's finger starts to trace the 
               route.

               Carol's pen follows, marking the route. Halfway to Billings, 
               Nick's finger abruptly stops. Carol stops the pen at the 
               same point.

               Beth, enters, hesitates, and then -- consciously ignoring

               Nick and Carol are walking away from the Pizza Hut, across a 
               huge parking lot, toward a large mall. Cars circle past them, 
               searching for close spots.

               Carol stops. On her face, the answer to his question is clear -- 
               she was stuck on Nick then and she's still stuck on him now.

               But she'd never let him know that.

               She starts walking. Nick hurries up beside her. They walk

               Nick's sedan pulls off into a service station with a giant

               A dimly lit room filled with raucous customers and lots of 
               neon beer signs. Waitresses in red dresses tote pitchers of 
               brew to the thirsty throng. At the far end a band plays a 
               foot-stompin' good time tune about a trucker on his way to 
               see his woman.

               THE CAMERA MOVES through the crowd and discovers Carol and 
               Beth sitting at a small table, an almost finished pitcher of 
               beer between them.

               They speak loudly to be heard over the din.

               bitter in her mouth and she puts her glass down in disgust.

                         compassion, and ran and..."

               Nick turns the radio off.

               He fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray.

               He takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it, 
               takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it 
               back on the seat.

               He stares at the road. He looks down to the front seat and 
               finds the map. He splits his attention between the road and 
               unfolding the map. The wind catches the map.

               The map billows up, covering his face. Losing control of the 
               car, Nick slaps it down.

               A car HORN blares.

               Nick jerks the car back into his lane, bats the map down 
               again, and pulls off to the side of the road.

               He stops the car and slams the shift into park.

               He opens his door a crack, turning on the dome light. He 
               smooths out the map on the dashboard.

               Billings and Enfield are marked with Carol's big red circles.

<b>               CLOSE-UP - THE MAP
</b>
               Nick's finger traces from Enfield toward Billings along the 
               route Carol highlighted with the red felt-tip. Halfway to 
               Billings, the red line stops. Nick's finger stops.

               He stares at the map.

               Beth comes in the front door. The sound of Sid whistling 
               comes softly from the kitchen.

               Beth stares at the t.v. for a moment then strides purposefully 
               toward the kitchen.

<b>               INT. BETH'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Sid is standing on the counter masking the top sill of the 
               kitchen window. There's half a donut hanging from his mouth.

               Beth comes through the swinging door.

               The half-donut falls from the startled Sid's mouth.

               Sid climbs down and sits on the counter, dropping the half-

               So was Sid -- but he realizes Beth doesn't believe it can be 
               as simple as that.

                         But it's probably very close.

               Beth smiles weakly. Abruptly, she drops her donut back in 
               the box.

               Bathed in moonlight, Sid and Beth make tender passionate 
               love.

               Sid has never wanted someone so much and Beth has never felt 
               so wanted.

               Beth clings to Sid as if she were afraid of being swept 
               away... and then she is.

               Mr. August, Elizabeth and Nick, sitting at a large antique

               A flicker of loss crosses his face.

               Beth stares at him, uncertainly. He leans up and gently traces 
               circles on Beth's skin.

                         I knew her as she changed. But she 
                         was still the same person. All the

<b>               INT./EXT. NICK'S SEDAN - NIGHT
</b>
               Nick looks like hell -- his eyes red, his hair a mess. The 
               nearly empty scotch bottle is on the dashboard.

               The car windows are open, the roar of the wind competing 
               with the blasting radio.

               Nick suddenly jerks the wheel over.

<b>               EXT. ABANDONED REST STOP - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               The sedan screeches off the highway into the abandoned rest 
               area.

               It stops facing a battered phone booth -- the engine turns 
               off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth.

<b>               IN THE SEDAN
</b>
               Nick turns off the radio. It is suddenly very quiet -- only 
               the occasional lonely DRONE OF A TRUCK passing on the highway. 
               He takes a deep breath.

<b>               INT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
               Nick is standing in the phone booth, harshly lit by his 
               headlights.

                         information in Arizona?... Thank 
                         you.

               Nick dials with drunken concentration.

               He hangs up. He hits himself in the head in angry disbelief. 
               He hurriedly dials zero and listens for a moment, desperately 
               summoning up all his salesman charm.

                         there's a problem. My phone's been 
                         disconnected, not because of bills, 
                         I mean we paid all our bills. We 
                         were hardly ever even late. We were 
                         very good customers, but we're moving, 
                         so we had the phone disconnected. 
                         But now I need to call... the woman 
                         I live with. She's still there and 
                         I've got to let her know where I am.

               Nick listens, shaking his head emphatically.

                         last name.
                              (he listens, frustrated)

                         emergency.

                         Yes it can, it can be done. Someone 
                         there can hook the phone back up. 
                         It's not like a phone guy came to 
                         our house to disconnect the phone, 
                         nobody came to our house, someone 
                         just flipped a switch somewhere, 
                         somewhere there where you work, or 
                         plugged something into a computer 
                         and our phone stopped working!
                              (he listens)
                         They turned it off, they can turn it 
                         back on!

                              to panic)

                         have a phone thing to hook it up to 
                         the real computer! That's how these 
                         people live! They'll be glad to do 
                         it!...

               Nick listens. Suddenly all his energy drains away.

               Sid is sprawled out over the bed, sleeping, Beth nestled 
               against him. She stirs and cuddles closer.

               Suddenly she realizes it's not Nick. She pulls away, 
               orientating herself. She quickly scoots out of bed and 
               hurriedly pulls on a pair of jeans.

               The alarm clock CLANGS.

               Beth looks about for the alarm. She tensely scatters some 
               boxes. She dumps one, finds the alarm and shuts it off. She 
               stares at the clock and drops it into a box.

               Beth and Mrs. Dotson are standing beside the now empty 
               blankets.

               In the BACKGROUND, Sid and Carol are packing boxes into Mrs. 
               Dotson's car.

               Mrs. Dotson has begun to fill out a check.

                         won't have an account, so I'll have 
                         to find someplace to cash it for me.

               Mrs. Dotson looks at her. They stare into each other's eyes.

                         All right.

               Mrs. Dotson hands Beth the check. Beth sticks it in her back 
               pocket. After an awkward moment she extends her hand.

                         and the big things.

               He heads into the house. Beth stares after him. Mrs. Dotson 
               touches her shoulder, lightly, getting her attention.

               The CAMERA FOLLOWING he races up to Carol's front door and 
               leans on the doorbell -- a loud tight buzzing.

               He pounds on the door, then stops, gasping for breath. No 
               one's home. He turns, leaning against the door for support, 
               staring out at tract house neighborhood.

               It's empty. He eyes it for a moment then hurls it as far as

               He races to his front door and stops dead in his tracks at

               isn't.

                         home.

               They move toward the front door, Carol going backwards.

               Nick looks to make eye contact with Carol. He can't. She's 
               looking back over her shoulder for obstacles. He smiles and 
               glances toward the couple.

               Nick and Carol go out the door, lugging the t.v.

               They're lugging the t.v. across to Carol's -- Carol backing 
               up and Nick going forward. They arrive at the front door.

               Nick takes most of the weight of the t.v., while Carol fumbles 
               with her key into her front door lock with her free hand.

               They lug the t.v. toward the living room.

                         I went to my parent's house. Like 
                         you said to. And there was this 
                         ancient man, this giant man in the 
                         doorway.

               They step into the living room.

               Carol leads them to a corner.

               Nick slumps down onto the sofa. Carol watches him, puzzled.

                         be my father. He was wearing a long 
                         overcoat, and I thought, "it's a
