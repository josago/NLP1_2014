<b>               EXT. LATE AFTERNOON SKY
</b>
               Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of 
               sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day.

<b>               SUPER TITLE: "HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020."
</b>
               As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE.

<b>                                     PHIL
</b>                         T minus ten, nine, eight, start 
                         ignition sequence, five, four, three, 
                         two, one, ignition... Liftoff!

               A tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, 
               ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER, 
               excited SHOUTS.

<b>               EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a 
               gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has 
               got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using 
               an empty longneck as his launching tube.

<b>                                     CHILDREN

                         My turn! My turn! No, I was next! 
                         No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can 
                         I do one? I want to do one!

<b>                                     PHIL
</b>                         Guys, guys, please! This is risky 
                         stuff here. And I'm a highly trained 
                         professional.

               Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins. 
               There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting 
               poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for 
               silence.

<b>                                     PHIL
</b>                         Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch 
                         another booster...

               Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman, 
               is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and 
               Phil catches it.

<b>                                     PHIL
</b>                         ...just as soon as he completes his 
                         fuel intake.

<b>               ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE
</b>
               Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin 
               to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in 
               the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. 
               DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their 
               families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out 
               blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of 
               balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, 
               from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed 
               about. A banner, strung between trees, reads "BON VOYAGE, 
<b>               MARS ONE!!!"
</b>
<b>                                     WILLIS
</b>                         It'll take us six months just to get 
                         to Mars. Another year on the surface, 
                         then six months back. That's two 
                         years...

               Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, 
               NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm 
               around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, 
               ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, 
               early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all 
               too well.

<b>                                     WILLIS
</b>                         I guess what I'm trying to say is, 
                         since this is my last night on Earth, 
                         it's gonna be a very precious memory 
                         to me. Y'know?

<b>                                     PRETTY GIRL
</b>                         Nice try, Nick.

               As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and 
               walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his 
               beer, swigs it.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open-
               pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has 
               paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI 
               KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as 
               they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily 
               at the chef.

<b>                                     KIROV
</b>                         Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't 
                         be heading back to Earth till ten 
                         days after you guys land at our base 
                         camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty 
                         good long rendezvous.

               WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat 
               over a Hawaiian shirt and a "KISS THE CHEF" apron. An entire 
               pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting 
               this as he smiles at Malik.

<b>                                     WOODY
</b>                         What are you suggesting, Sergei?

<b>                                     KIROV
</b>                         Maybe you should bring a baseball 
                         bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two 
                         crews could have ourselves a little 
                         Solar System Series.

<b>                                     WOODY
</b>                         Please. Half you guys are foreigners. 
                         We'd crush you.

<b>                                     KIROV
</b>                         No, no, we have equal crews. Three 
                         men, one woman. Same handicap.

               He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him.

<b>                                     WOODY
</b>                         Easy now, you're talking about my 
                         wife.
                              (seeing her approach)
                         And Terri just happens to be one 
                         helluva shortstop.

               DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of 
               corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive 
               by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss 
               Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. 
               Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.

<b>                                     TERRI
</b>                         Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls 
                         his own strikes. Thousand bucks make 
                         it interesting?

               He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who 
               smiles, nods her cool agreement.

<b>                                     COTE
</b>                         Eh bien. Winner take all.

<b>                                     TERRI
</b>                         Good.
                              (smiles sweetly at 
                              Kirov)
                         Bring some balls.

               The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as 
               Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt 
               grin.

<b>                                     WOODY
</b>                         You wanna know the sad part? 
                         Technically I outrank her. But if we 
                         want any peace at all on Mars Two, 
                         I'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes, 
                         dears."

               The others laugh.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run 
               by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a 
               picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers 
               of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.

</b>                         ...just not sure how I feel about 
                         NASA allowing couples to go on this 
                         type of mission together.

               One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st 
               Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter.

<b>                                     1ST WIFE
</b>                              (embarrassed)
                         Nothing personal, Terri. It's just 
                         that, well, it's kind of a funny 
                         feeling for those of us staying 
                         behind.

<b>                                     TERRI
</b>                              (carefully neutral)
                         All the research shows that marriage 
                         will provide stability on these long 
                         duration trips.

                         the couples I've known.

               Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really 
               have much in common with these women -- before moving on. 
               ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight 
               tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around.

                         Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her 
                         grave almost every day.
                              (lowers her voice)
                         They say he could lose mission status.

                         tragic. You go to a routine physical 
                         one day, and wham.

</b>                         Must be a pretty funny feeling for 
                         Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna 
                         be in the history books. First man 
                         on Mars...

               She shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in 
               agreement, following her glance...

               In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage, 
               his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs 
               which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another 
               figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him.

               CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early 
               30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE 
               GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the 
               restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her 
               approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her 
               with an apologetic smile.

               He looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his 
               arms around her waist, kisses her forehead.

               He kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him, 
               with a mixture of pride and sadness.

               ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into

<b>               EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still 
               shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead.

               In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes 
               Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to 
<b>               PRETTY GIRL #2.

                         But I guess I'll have my memories to 
                         keep me warm...

               Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he 
               reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder.

               A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around 
               his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby 
               on a tripod. He looks lonely.

               Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. 
               BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at 
               the sky.

                         bedtime?

               Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.

                         never gonna finish our book.

               His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears. 
               Luke is moved. Another brief silence.

</b>                         Well, I'll tell you what. I've been 
                         thinking about that. And what I 
                         thought was -- how 'bout if I bring 
                         along my own copy?
                              (Bobby looks at him)
                         Then every night, wherever I am, 
                         I'll read a little bit more of it. 
                         And I'll know that you and Mommy, 
                         wherever you are, you're reading it 
                         too. That way, it'll feel like we're 
                         still reading it together. 'Cause I 
                         don't know about you, but I'm pretty 
                         anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn 
                         got marooned on that island. What 
                         d'you say?

               Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better. 
               Luke is proud of his son's courage.

</b>                         Good deal. Can I have a hug?

               Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke 
               fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin 
               young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. 
               Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. 
               They both turn.

               An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone.

               Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.

<b>               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver 
               climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes 
               out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. 
               The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a 
               moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards 
               the party, then pauses again.

               Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She 
               smiles tentatively.

               JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has 
               dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in.

               Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet 
               competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural 
               leader.

               Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They 
               separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining.

                              (she smiles)
                         It's his night, Deb. I didn't want 
                         to spoil it.

                         looking for you.

               Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around 
               Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them 
               so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles.

               McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and 
               together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards 
               the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we...

               All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: 
               McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of 
               the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched 
               behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They 
               zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.

<b>               EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT
</b>
               The yard is nearly deserted. The "Bon Voyage" banner has 
               torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a 
               napkin blows across the ground.

               In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the 
               waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.

               As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a 
               moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the 
               sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots 
               mingling with the silver ones.

               The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even 
               Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat.

               He grabs playfully at Woody's neck. Woody smacks his hand 
               away, laughing.

               He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship 
               emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at 
               McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh.

               Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at 
               the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing. 
               McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.

               He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once 
               his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. 
               Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell 
               shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them, 
               walking away a few steps.

               Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance.

               With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into 
               gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence.

               walks back towards his house. McConnell watches him for a

               A tiny reddish dot hovers there, glowing steadily. Mars 
               itself, a tantalizing prize. But for him now, more distant 
               than ever. For him, perhaps, never to be attained.

               Instantly we're hurled into an immense, stunning LANDSCAPE, 
               mysterious and vivid as a fever dream. Dazzling sunlight. A 
               vast plain of rust-orange soil. Countless craters. Boulders 
               the size of houses, tossed about by the hands of gods. Twin

               rock hammer against a multi-layered, sedimentary rock face. 
               Reddish dust coats his bulky white suit. Despite that bulk, 
               he moves easily in the light Martian gravity (1/3 Earth's). 
               A hunk of rock breaks off, and Luke examines it more closely,

               The crew of Mars One - Kirov, Willis, and Cote -- have joined 
               Luke, gathered around some display monitors. They're in NASA 
               jumpsuits; the Hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced 
               gravity, and heat. All are captivated by what they see. ON A

</b>
               We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt-
               covered MOUNTAIN. Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge. 
               What's most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely 
               protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along 
               the mountain's ridgeline. Its whiteness is in clear contrast 
               to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what's 
               more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth, 
               multi-planed symmetry.

               share some secret joke Luke's not yet in on.

               The rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby. The hatch 
               door cracks open and some dust vents out. The door opens all 
               the way and the astronauts climb out. They all look up in 
               awe. We hear their voices ON RADIOS.

               the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain -- an

               MULTINATIONAL CREWMEMBERS walk by, in the artificial gravity 
               of the busy station, as RAY BECK, mid-50s, approaches from 
               the opposite direction. Beck is the tough, crewcut, PR-savvy 
               head of the NASA Mars Program (ID'd by his name tag), and 
               just now he's leading a covey of U.N. AMBASSADORS on a tour. 
               The ambassadors, of both sexes, many nations, and all races, 
               look as excited as schoolkids.

               The ambassadors enter, oohing and ahhing over the impressive 
               array of gadgetry and personnel, and especially over the big 
               screen. Some of them start taking souvenir snaphots. The 
               NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR turns to Beck, whispering curiously.

               Smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding.

               A look of relief comes over McConnell.

               McConnell winces -- Dear God, no -- as, on the screen, Kirov 
               appears from OFF CAMERA holding a cupcake with a burning 
               candle stuck in it, and the Mars One crew starts SINGING 
               "Happy Birthday" to him. Loudly. And very off-key.

               Soon most everyone in MMCR is singing along -- even some of 
               the jolly ambassadors -- with the noticeable exception of 
               Beck, who stiffens unhappily. McConnell is mortified.

               with a fake "I'm-a-good-sport" grin.

               Luke and the crew finish singing the song. Luke raises the 
               cupcake in a toast.

               He and his crew lean in, blow out the candle. They laugh and

               Luke reaches out, turns OFF the CAMERA, and the display screen

               Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's. He's annoyed, 
               as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's 
               fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly.

               debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface 
               of the slopes.

<b>               THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS
</b>
               Stare up at this spectacle, awed. A cyclone? Some kind of 
               energy wave? They have no idea. At the moment they're too 
               fascinated to even be scared.

<b>               TILTING UP - FROM THEIR POV
</b>
               We see the whirling cylinder rise, higher and higher, 
               perfectly straight, until in just moments it's as tall as a 
               skyscraper. As it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing 
               at its top into a conical vortex. It's sucking up so much 
               dirt, so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that the 
               accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent 
               outer "skin".

<b>               THE ASTRONAUTS
</b>
               Exchange amazed glances. Can't believe their eyes...

               Luke, still staring in fascination, becomes aware of sand 
               and pebbles flashing past his helmet. From behind. He turns.

<b>               SAND PATTERS AGAINST HIS FACEPLATE
</b>
               As the nearby landscape BLURS. The vacuuming effect is 
               becoming more general across the area. More violent.

<b>               LUKE IS ALARMED
</b>
               And the spell is broken. He keys his throat mike, his lips 
               moving, but no sound can be heard over the ROARING WIND. He 
               waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards 
               the rover. Wind whips at their EVA suits as they obey him, 
               retreating.

               Luke, backing away himself, is afraid to take his eyes off 
               the cylinder.

               Then he sees that one man -- Willis -- hasn't moved. In fact 
               he's busily snapping photographs of the cylinder. Luke hurries 
               over to him, tugs his sleeve.

<b>               WILLIS LOWERS HIS CAMERA
</b>
               But still stares up, transfixed, like a man face to face 
               with a cobra. Luke follows the young astronaut's frightened 
               gaze, and his own eyes widen as he sees

<b>               THE TOP OF THE VORTEX
</b>
               Beginning to tilt down, then coil sideways. Suddenly they're 
               looking into the huge open "mouth" of it, as sand and rocks 
               fly into the swirling darkness...

               The monstrous, gaping maw slithers down over the rim of the 
               mountain, turning this way, then that. Seeking them. And 
               then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little 
               group of astronauts. And lunges towards them...

<b>               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY
</b>
               Luke and Willis turn, running as hard as they can towards 
               the rover. But the suction is so great, it's as if they're 
               held back by wires.

               The ground itself is SHAKING, RUMBLING, as earthquakes begin 
               to open fissures across the plain. The ROAR of the vortex, 
               the GROANING of the earth, are like an onrushing freight 
               train...

<b>               AHEAD OF THEM
</b>
               In the maelstrom of flying debris, they can barely make out 
               Cote and Kirov, still retreating, leaning back with all their 
               strength against the suction, while staring up, aghast.

               Suddenly a hurtling rock, the size of a basketball, smashes 
               into Cote's helmet from behind, crushing it and killing her 
               instantly. Blood sprays into the wind, immediately 
               crystallizing, in the sub-zero atmosphere, into red pellets...

<b>               LUKE, HORRIFIED, FLINGS HIS ARM UP
</b>
               As bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm. An 
               instant later he sees

<b>               KIROV
</b>
               Snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying 
               blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream 
               as he vanishes...

<b>               THE GROUND AT LUKE'S FEET
</b>
               Abruptly opens, and he slides into a fissure. Scrabbling 
               frantically with his gloved hands, he manages to momentarily 
               arrest his fall, gripping the edge of the fault line, with 
               his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip. The air is 
               almost solidly choked with debris, deadly boulders bound 
               over him, and torrents of cascading sand are burying him 
               alive...

<b>               CLOSE ON LUKE
</b>
               Barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final 
               instant, as...

<b>               HIS LAST CREWMAN, WILLIS
</b>
               Is sucked bodily into the black maw of the vortex, spinning 
               and tumbling like a rag doll...

<b>               CLOSE ON WILLIS'S FACE
</b>
               His features grotesquely distorted by the forces tearing at 
               him, before suddenly his faceplate is sprayed with blood, 
               and...

<b>               DISTANT ANGLE - LUKE'S POV
</b>
               Willis's spacesuit explodes, his entire body disintegrating 
               into a million bits, which instantly disappear into the 
               hellish maelstrom. And then that maelstrom itself, just as 
               abruptly...

               STOPS. Vanishes.

               There is an instant, ringing SILENCE, as awesome in its own 
               way as the roaring storm itself had been...

<b>               WIDE ANGLE
</b>
               On the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction, 
               pitter down, bouncing. Swirls of dust and sand drift away, 
               settling gently. The harsh orange landscape is once again 
               calm, peaceful.

               And then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear 
               another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns.

               As McConnell finishes his message to Luke.

               MOVING ANGLE, the CAMERA EXPLORING ground zero, as the bass, 
               pulsing rumble continues...

               WE PASS the Rover, canted sideways into a little crater, 
               with its canopy missing, one axle fractured, but miraculously 
               still with all four wheels...

               WE PASS faithful little ARES-8, lying on its side, partially 
               crushed under a boulder. It gives a final, pitiful WHINE, 
               its video snout slowly extending, then dies. And finally we 
               come to the area where the fissure had been, and see

</b>
               Leaving only a slender crease of umber sand. No sign of Luke. 
               The pulsing rumble continues, over, as we see

<b>               EXT. AERIAL VIEW. DAY
</b>
               An extraordinary sight, seen from high in the air, looking 
               back down. Staring up at us from the bottom of a shallow 
               crater, scoured clean of its aeons of accumulated silt and 
               rubble, is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face.

               The surface is gleaming white, apparently metallic. The 
               features are suggested by intricately interlocking planes, 
               slopes, ramps. The "eyes" -- hatches of some kind? -- are 
               closed, and the overall expression is eerily calm, but 
               terrible in its power, like some ancient tribal mask.

               We see the Face clearly for only a few beats before thick, 
               scudding clouds OBSCURE it, but the deep, pulsing rumble 
               continues, low and insistent...

               We're inside the Mars Two spacecraft, which is still in its 
               docked position alongside the Space Station.

               Woody Blake, wearing a NASA jumpsuit, floats up into the 
               cockpit in Zero-G, studying a thick manual.

               He straps into the pilot's seat, staring at an electrical 
               junction box at one end of the console.

               He swings open the housing, revealing a bewildering tangle 
               of fuses and wires. He sighs heavily, as Terri drifts up

               Beck and McConnell are huddled together at the CAPCOM's

               Both men are seated, leaning forward, with McConnell listening 
               intently, while Beck does most of the talking, very quietly. 
               After a moment McConnell looks up in surprise. His eyes search

               Is a study in conflicting emotions. But after a moment he 
               masters his feelings, turns back toward Beck. A few more 
               quiet words are exchanged, then Beck offers his hand. 
               McConnell hesitates, then shakes it. Both men rise, and 
               McConnell turns again to look towards

               Glides INTO VIEW. "MARS RECOVERY" (formerly Mars Two) looks 
               much like its sister craft on Mars: a conical cockpit mounted 
               above a "tuna can" crew Hab module.

               The entire lower deck forms a segmented section of the hull 
               that rotates on bearings to provide artificial gravity; we 
               see window ports spinning past, then an American flag emblem.

               Behind this lower deck, in an extending network of struts, 
               like the abdomen of a dragonfly, are the three huge round 
               PROPELLANT TANKS. Then vast, delicate-looking rectangular 
               SOLAR PANELS, which sweep out to either side of the ship; 
               these also bear the dish of the earth-pointing HI-GAIN 
               ANTENNA. And finally comes the great mass of the ENGINE BELLS, 
               housed within a curving AEROSHELL; three hatches in the 
               aeroshell can open to allow the main thrusters to fire through 
               for a mid-course burn.

               To the forward section of the ship, APPROACHING a viewport

               the EVA airlock, it's zero G.

               Phil, strapped into a chair by a galley counter, is just 
               completing this weightless puzzle by placing a final blue 
               M&M. He looks bored, sluggish. In the b.g., Terri is hunched 
               over a microscope.

               McConnell emerges from the core tunnel, behind them, coming 
               up from the lower Hab, then pushes off from the ladder, 
               floating towards Phil. He grins, admiring Phil's obsessive

               McConnell and Terri laugh as Phil starts scarfing down the

               He's drifted to another short ladder, and now grabs it, starts 
               up to the cockpit, atop the Hab.

               As McConnell appears in the cockpit, he sees Woody by the

               MARS completely fills the screen. Surface details are clearly

               too terrible to dwell on. McConnell looks back at Mars.

               looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of

               Over the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP'S COMPUTER,

</b>                         Maggie, why does this have to be 
                         about us? Mars is a great opportunity 
                         for pure science.

</b>                         We'll do the science. And we'll do 
                         it very well. That's what we've 
                         trained for. But what if there's 
                         more...? In all our myths, in every 
                         human culture, Mars has always held 
                         a special attraction. What if that 
                         means something? Only we don't 
                         understand it yet...

               The mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up 
               in Maggie's spell. She has a radiant simplicity. The VIDEO 
               CAMERA DRIFTS IN ON HER; we are caught up, too.

                         life...

               She looks at McConnell, smiles. He takes her hand.

                         look beyond it to the next one. It's 
                         who we are.

               A silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her 
               passion. She smiles, suddenly self-conscious. She hadn't 
               meant to get so carried away.

               He and Woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. A beat.

               Woody glances at him. It's true. Rather than being saddened, 
               McConnell seems to have taken on new strength. A renewed 
               sense of wonder.

               McConnell nods. They clasp hands briefly. Deal. Then Woody 
               turns. Before leaving, he hesitates just a moment, turning 
               back. One last thought, and he doesn't know he's going to 
               say it until it comes out.

               this open pulling out a

               Then spins around in zero-G, as his eyes track

               insulation. The blood droplets are whirling out through here, 
               going into the vacuum of space.

               Quickly Woody stuffs the muzzle of the patch gun into the 
               puncture, firing a thick grey sealant. We hear MORE PINGS, 
               ECHOING LOUDLY, but after a few seconds they DIMINISH, then 
               abruptly STOP. The KLAXONS continue to wail.

               the meteor shower has passed by, as abruptly as it appeared.

               the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock

               Woody jets back towards the open EVA hatch. But as he reaches 
               this, about to re-enter the ship, he's captured momentarily 
               by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him.

<b>               SUNRISE OVER MARS

               As the huge planet is REVEALED in all its red, unearthly 
               glory. It's so close now that individual features can be 
               seen with the naked eye -- the vast chasm of Valles Marineris, 
               and then Olympus Mons, poking all the way up through the 
               Martian atmosphere. A stunning, alluring spectacle.

               Stares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the side 
               of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor. Dawn, after a very 
               long night indeed. He whispers lovingly, under his breath.

               Then he stirs himself out of his reverie and hurries through 
               the EVA hatch.

               CAMERA DRIFTS QUICKLY BACK and down along the hull as stark 
               sunlight flares off the big propellant tanks, three in a 
               row, and the thick silver tubes that join them. There's a 
               good deal of scarring and denting from the meteor shower. 
               Then, as the ship begins to MOVE OUT OF FRAME...

<b>               WE MOVE IN CLOSER

               On one of these tubes, a feeder line to the engine bells, we 
               see a scatter of tiny, undetected holes, about the size of 
               the eraser at the end of a pencil. So small, so apparently

               look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce

               Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up 
               Phil's hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her seat 
               and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes.

               Phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own 
               eyes. His voice catches for a moment.

                         Try to close your fingers, Phil, 
                         nice and slowly.

               Phil starts curling up his fingers. The middle digit remains 
               extended in the universal gesture. They all consider this 
               for a moment. Then Phil looks up cheerfully.

               The astronauts are outside the ship, tethered to each other 
               with long shock cords. Other cords, clipped to their suits, 
               trail gear bags. Phil clutches a silver metallic case -- his 
               precious computer repair kit. Woody is in the MMU. They're 
               all rotating at the same speed as the ship behind them.

               All four astronauts fire a brief, simultaneous burst from 
               the tiny attitude control thrusters in their suits. This 
               stops their rotation, bringing their travel under control. 
               The ship continues spinning in the background.

               Woody takes a final look at the charred, doomed Mars Recovery. 
               The only home they've known for six months. He exchanges a 
               silent glance with the others. They all expect to be dead in 
               the next few minutes. Woody takes a breath, nods.

               He pops the big thrusters on the MMU and starts heading away 
               from the ship. The cord between Woody and the others pulls 
               taut and they start to follow.

               From a compartment on the side of the MMU, Woody pulls out...

               About the size of a large flare gun. There's a carabiner-

               McConnell looks at him. They both know how risky this is, 
               and they also know it's their only chance. Woody flips a 
               switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. Off it comes, 
               trailing wire. Woody clips the hook to the MMU, then hands 
               McConnell the gun.

               McConnell nods. Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender, 
               loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the MMU jets at 
               full throttle. As Woody pulls away, line unspools from the 
               tether gun.

<b>               WOODY AND THE REMO

               Woody is chasing the REMO from above. It's as if he were in 
               an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway. 
               Woody is picking up speed quickly. Maybe too quickly. He 
               checks his armpad display screen.

                         gonna take the edge off.

               Woody starts braking with the MMU thrusters as hard as he 
               can.

<b>               CLOSE ON THE THRUSTERS

               Woody hits some buttons and the MMU's latches snap open. He 
               grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes 
               himself free of the MMU, starts firing his small suit jets.

<b>               WOODY'S POV

               McConnell finishes looking over the numbers on his display

               hers, they are red-rimmed. Haunted.

               into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They 
               find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the 
               tether gun.

               Right below him, filling his field of view. A long beat.

               Terri makes a snap decision. She grabs the tether gun from

               McConnell lunges after her, his gloved hand straining.

               But it's too late. She's already out of reach, and now fires 
               her suit jets, pulling quickly away from the REMO.

               Is reaching to activate his own jets, when

               Grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. They 
               stare at each other. McConnell wrenches his hand free, half-
               maddened, agonized, staring after Terri.

<b>               EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT

               The REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes, 
               packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside. 
               The hatch is sealed.

               McConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He's anguished, haunted by 
               the image of Woody's death. We see him struggling to overcome 
               his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate 
               on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has 
               been opened; he's facing

<b>               SMALL UTILITY MONITOR
</b>
               Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator 
               lights, com ports.

<b>               MCCONNELL
</b>
               Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a 
               palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins 
               tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He 
               turns, looking back at

<b>               TERRI AND PHIL
</b>
               Hunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land. 
               They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this 
               tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned 
               operation. It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold.

<b>               PHIL'S FACE
</b>
               Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and 
               fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer 
               supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.

<b>               TERRI
</b>
               Is worse. A thousand-yard stare. She's in shock.

<b>               MCCONNELL
</b>
               Knows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly.

                              (no response)
                         Hey, Phil...?

               Phil looks up at him dully.

<b>                                     MCCONNELL
</b>                         We're going in blind. We'll deploy 
                         the chutes by laptop. I need to get 
                         on the data bus, put in a software

                         with the patch.

               After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards 
               McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats, 
               then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins to 
               tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence.

                         Hey, Terri, I was wondering. Think 
                         maybe we could rig some kind of 
                         seatbelts out of those cargo straps?

               Terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her 
               hand, as if she's never seen it before. Dully she reaches 
               for another one, begins looping them together.

<b>               MCCONNELL
</b>
               Studies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can't 
               push them too hard, too fast. They're moving like robots, 
               but at least they're moving.

</b>
               Small thrusters are firing, getting the REMO into position 
               for entry into the atmosphere.

               Then all the jets fire in unison, braking the REMO, as it 
               falls away from us, towards Mars at night.

<b>               INT. REMO. HIGH ATMOSPHERE. NIGHT
</b>
               The astronauts, restrained on the floor by Terri's jury-rigged 
               strap system, hold on for dear life. The buffeting through 
               the atmosphere is shaking them violently.

<b>               BEHIND THEIR FACEPLATES
</b>
               We see the effect of the incredible g-forces: faces distorted, 
               unable to focus their eyes. Each of them thinking, once again: 
               Now I'm going to die...

               The Mars One Base Camp looms in the foreground, like some 
               desolate, otherwordly ghost town. And then, in the night sky 
               beyond it, we see an eerie and beautiful sight: a bright 
               streak of red as the REMO slashes down into the Martian 
               atmosphere, like a shooting star, finally disappearing behind 
               distant mountains. Then all is stillness again, deathly

               Beck stands by a viewport, staring out into space. He's just 
               lost four good friends, and also knows he is seeing, in this 
               disaster, the probable end of the Mars Program, and the

<b>               POV ANGLE - WIDE
</b>
               As we see the Mars One Base Camp: silent, very still. In the 
               distance, the massive ERV still looms, perched for takeoff, 
               the bottom rungs of its ladder buried.

<b>               PANNING
</b>
               We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well 
               as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse, 
               and the four-man rover. The oxygen still and propellant plant 
               are almost buried. Solar panels, some of them punctured by 
               micrometeors, FLAP and CREAK eerily in the slight breeze. 
               And finally,

<b>               CLOSER TO CAMERA
</b>
               We see the camp's American flag, still on its toppled pole, 
               but nearly obliterated by sand.

<b>               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, TERRI, AND PHIL
</b>
               Who are spooked by this desolation. They've paused at the 
               edge of the camp.

               They have dragged along with them from their landing site a 
               crude sledge, improvised from the REMO's hatch cover and 
               some cargo straps. On this, their meager supplies.

               McConnell, glancing at the others, knows he's got to keep 
               their spirits up. He kneels, digs out the flag pole. Brushing 
               off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the 
               ground, packing the sand down with his boot. He stands for a 
               moment looking at the flag, his eyes moist. Despite the cost, 
               they have made it to Mars.

               When he turns, Terri and Phil are looking at him, moved.

               to climb. The four-man rover is nearby, sand drifted high 
               against its tires.

               He unlatches a panel, grips the emergency lever inside, tugs 
               it. After a seeming eternity, the door groans and creaks 
               open. Little puffs of dust and sand swirl about, settle.

               On a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants

               even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on 
               the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through 
               pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever 
               assortment of collection jars. Liquid water.

               Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up 
               before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication, 
               he looks down at his forearm instrument pad.

               Blinking red letters read "25 deg. C." And something else -- 
               the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly

               Terri rises, concerned, and turns. Through the distant, 
               translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell's shadowy figure 
               can be seen, moving slowly.

<b>               INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY

               McConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing 
               through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping 
               foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he 
               looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, 
               jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has 
               come into play. He pauses, looking up...

               Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic 
               tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in 
               the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water 
               wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with 
               duct tape, like some giant Erector set.

               As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged 
               figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with 
               a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground.

               McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights 
               back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as 
               he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a 
               glimpse of the almost unrecognizable

               Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying 
               curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above 
               a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together. 
               In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high 
               overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull. 
               McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.

               We see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes. Then he yanks 
               his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles 
               in the air.

               As he stares down at McConnell, Luke's eyes finally light up 
               with recognition. but before he can move, he is seized from 
               behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripped 
               from his grasp, as Terri and Phil pinion his arms. McConnell 
               scrambles to his feet.

               McConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phil 
               that it's okay to let him go. They stand back, pulling off 
               their helmets. Everyone is panting, out of breath.

               Luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after 
               another, as if still not quite certain whether they might 
               vanish. His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse.

               Luke stares at McConnell, trying to absorb everything. He 
               looks to Terri, who looks down.

               Luke shakes his head in dismay. He seems to shrink in on 
               himself. It's all too much for him to take in. McConnell 
               kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him.

               Luke sits on the side of his cot, in the little tented 
               sleeping area he's created in one corner of the greenhouse.

                         all of a sudden, I knew why I was

               Luke, now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-looking 
               helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised 
               sledge, with its meager supplies. McConnell, Terri, and Phil 
               walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again. They hear 
               Luke over his RADIO.

               McConnell and the others are silent, embarrassed. Then 
               McConnell nods. Luke looks at him, a cracked grin.

               The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many

               diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated

               the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew.

               his hands together, poised over the keyboard.

               Pictures of the Face after the disaster, seen from ground-
               level, in telephoto views. Rising out of a ring of rock and 
               dirt rubble is the shiny-white profile of a gigantic face. 
               The white is smooth, impenetrable. It has the scale of a

               A few moments of silence while they try to absorb this.

               Luke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out very 
               quickly. He's been waiting so long to share this.

</b>                         That's what I thought. There are 
                         distinct blocks in the pattern, and 
                         within each block the tones come in 
                         groups of three. Threethreethree. 
                         For months I struggled to analyze 
                         it, trying different constructs... 
                         Then I thought about dimensions.

</b>                         Right! Three groups equals three 
                         dimensions... So I tried assigning 
                         different graphic values to each 
                         block, group and tone. And finally I 
                         got... this.

               He types another command. They all look at the monitor, the

               Luke pauses, rubbing the unfamiliar smoothness of his cheek.

               His passion startles them; they've never seen him so 
               emotional. He points at the computer screen.

               McConnell, Terri, and Phil have gathered around Luke as he 
               pushes buttons, and a monitor CRACKLES to life. White streaks, 
               then a blurry image, which he tries to enhance. Finally the

               They see the familiar stark white profile of the FACE, shot 
               from ground level, in a SLOWLY APPROACHING ANGLE...

<b>               THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS
</b>
               Stare at the ominous sight. They're all more nervous than 
               they want to show. Luke's fingers delicately work a joystick 
               as he maneuvers the remote surveyor.

<b>               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY
</b>
               Ares-8 whines to a stop by a large boulder, which partially 
               shields it from the Face, looming beyond. The radar gun 
               swivels, locating its target. Then stops, ready to fire.

<b>               INT. MARS ONE HAB. LATE DAY
</b>
               Luke looks at Terri, Phil, and McConnell. Phil shuts the lid 
               of the box holding the new nav boards, snaps it protectively 
               down. He nods. Terri takes a deep breath, then she nods.

               Luke's hand hovers over the red firing button; a moment of 
               awesome uncertainty and danger. He looks at McConnell, who 
               finally gives a nod of command. Then Luke hits the button.

<b>               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. LATE DAY
</b>
               From the radar gun on Ares-8's back, a sharp, high-pitched 
               electronic burst is emitted, pulsating like a tuning fork as 
               it's fired towards the Face. After a few seconds it stops.

               For a moment nothing happens.

               Then the deep bass rumbling stops as well. The only remaining 
               sound is of WIND, stirring up dust on the Martian plains.

<b>               ANGLE ON THE FACE
</b>
               As suddenly a huge, curved segment of the white surface begins 
               to rise from the earth, like a gigantic hangar door, sliding 
               out of sight into an upper sheath of some kind. The movement 
               is measured, stately, utterly silent. As the segment rises, 
               it reveals a blinding white light: the interior of the Face. 
               No inside details can be seen.

               McConnell, Luke, Terri and Phil stare at this phenomenon,

               McConnell is staring at the mysterious opening. On his face, 
               a growing look of determination.

               McConnell, once again helmeted, emerges from the Hab airlock. 
               Luke, Terri and Phil are coming out behind him. The wind has 
               picked up, and fine dust is blowing. They stop, staring off 
               in astonishment towards

<b>               A FRIGHTENING SIGHT

               The entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon into 
               purplish-black at the horizon, with bloody streaks above. 
               The DUST STORM has turned their way; it's now sixty kilometers 
               away and closing. The main body of it reaches two thousand 
               meters above the surface and stretches out along a thousand-
               kilometer front.

               Stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed. McConnell turns to 
               Luke, whose expression is grim.

               McConnell turns, staring off towards the killer storm. The 
               others look at him with questioning gazes. He turns again. 
               There's the four-man rover, ready to go. Waiting.

               He looks a question at Luke and Terri, one after the other. 
               Their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement.

               They start towards the four-man rover. Dust is swirling more 
               thickly through the air, and the WIND IS LOUDER NOW. Phil 
               stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure.

               In a WIDE SHOT, we see the rover approaching the Face, across 
               the plains. The sky beyond the Face is almost black, as the 
               storm approaches from that direction. It's marching 
               relentlessly across the planet, with flashes of lightning 
               now rippling up and down its face, and even small tornadoes 
               spinning off near its purple-black base...

               In a HIGH SHOT, we look down across the side of the Face and 
               its vast, open doorway, out of which the bright white light 
               is streaming. Into this corridor of light, we see the rover 
               arrive, slewing to a stop, throwing sand from its wheels.

               As they are stunned by the immensity of the scene, the cosmic

               Luke smiles. The three of them stare into the portal. 
               McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each of 
               them by a gloved hand. They take a sort of collective breath. 
               Then they walk forward together, into the light.

               The astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a 
               free hand.

               The light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances, 
               textures, colors -- anything at all. They can't see walls, 
               ceiling, even a floor.

               Behind them, there is an abrupt WHOOOSH, like a giant airlock 
               sealing shut. They turn, startled and nervous. Letting go of 
               each other's hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they 
               came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of some 
               sort. The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them.

               The three scared, helmeted faces seem to float in the 
               brightness, some twenty feet apart.

               realizes that he's hearing only silence over his radio.

               McConnell is staring at his spacesuit's sleeve. He can see 
               that the suit material is starting to deflate, revealing the 
               shape of his arm, just as it did in Luke's greenhouse. He 
               hesitates, then begins to unscrew the sealing ring on his 
               right glove.

               Terri and Luke see this.

               McConnell makes the final twist on his glove and there's the 
               hiss of rushing air.

<b>                                     LUKE

               Terri nods. McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring. 
               Luke follows suit.

</b>                         Hey, there may be some lethal trace

                         or... oh, the hell with it.

               Terri starts taking off her helmet. In a few moments, all 
               three helmets are off. They hold them, glowing softly, against 
               their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. Air. 
               And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed 
               another kind of test...

<b>               HIGH, STRIATED WALL
</b>
               Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled 
               eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands, 
               plates, ramps. It's part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height 
               and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the 
               hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach 
               ramp, is unmistakable. Radiant white light streams out from 
               within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts.

<b>               THE ASTRONAUTS BLINK
</b>
               Raising their gloves against the dazzling glow. At the end 
               of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame

<b>               A SHAPE MATERIALIZES
</b>
               And slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form, 
               which we somehow sense is female. She appears benign, 
               wondrous. This glowing MARTIAN -- a holograph -- regards the 
               astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to 
               say "Enter." All her motions are both calm and calming -- 
               precise, unhurried, gracious.

<b>               MCCONNELL, LUKE AND TERRI
</b>
               Look at each other. They're awed into silence, and still 
               tense, but now more out of excitement and anticipation than 
               fear. Their eyes agree: Let's go.

               They walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the 
               ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the Martian, 
               who retreats before them. They go through the hatch and 
               disappear inside.

<b>               INT. MARTIAN STRUCTURE. DUSK
</b>
               Following the Martian, they find themselves in a round, open 
               space, defined by light, with a smooth matte-metallic floor, 
               but without apparent walls.

               The Martian stops, turns, facing them. The astronauts stop, 
               too, uncertain what they're meant to do. Then the Martian 
               gestures again.

               A cylindrical holographic column appears, rising from the 
               floor in front of the astronauts. Inside it, a swirl of eerie 
               lights, millions of them, like cosmic fireflies...

<b>               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI
</b>
               Set down their helmets, then cautiously converge around this 
               column, forming a loose triangle. As they stare into it, the 
               myriad lights are reflected off their own eyes and their 
               spacesuits.

<b>               IN THE HOLOGRAPHIC COLUMN
</b>
               The whirling lights resolve into images, which relate to 
               them the story of ancient Mars:

<b>               A BLUE PLANET

               And a wall of fire and debris scours the planet. Oceans boil

               Involuntarily flinch, bathed in the fiery images...

<b>               THE PLANET IS NOW DEAD

               As dust storms roil across its cold, lifeless surface. The 
               flaming hunks of molten rock cool into twin moons.

<b>               THE ASTRONAUTS

               Stare at this devastation, deeply moved.

<b>               IN DEEP SPACE

               The stream of Martian ships grows smaller and smaller as it 
               continues on its epic voyage towards a new solar system. 
               Then we zero in on

<b>               ONE PARTICULAR ROCKETSHIP
</b>
               As it peels off and goes in another direction. Graphics show 
               a model of what the ship contains: the familiar double helix 
               of DNA. The ship heads towards another blue planet in our 
               solar system...

<b>               EARTH
</b>
               As it was then. More clouds than now, more ocean, and the 
               landforms all wedged together.

<b>               TERRI

               Her voice is soft.

</b>                         Earth, when it was still Pangaea.

<b>               THE LONE MARTIAN SHIP

               Makes a fiery streak through Earth's atmosphere and plunges 
               into the ocean.

               Instantly the image of the DNA double helix grows, filling 
               the entire holographic column, then it begins to spin and 
               pulse, disintegrating into a phantasmagoric whirl of new 
               images...

<b>               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI
</b>
               Cry out, stunned by the strobelike power of the display as

<b>               LIVING FORMS
</b>
               Flash into the holographic column, swimming, growing, 
               crawling, leaping, flying: one-celled microscopic organisms, 
               plankton, plants of all kinds, insects, then fish, dinosaurs, 
               birds, small mammals, larger mammals -- the entire stunning 
               panorama of evolution, distilled into a single explosive 
               sequence, as the images wash over the dazzled, awestruck

<b>               FACES OF THE ASTRONAUTS
</b>
               Until finally the images whirl away, the holographic column 
               dissolves, leaving only a circle of glowing, concentric, 
               colored rings on the floor. The astronauts are left staring 
               at each other across the open space where the column had 
               been.

<b>               THE MARTIAN
</b>
               Now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their 
               circle, taking the fourth position. McConnell is opposite 
               her glowing form, and Terri and Luke are at either side. The 
               Martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands. 
               As they do so, the Martian seems to be staring directly into 
               McConnell's eyes.

               Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. It's 
               the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness 
               or reserve. Staring at the Martian, he understands.

                         ago, there was a sudden expansion of 
                         life on Earth. The first multi-celled 
                         plants and animals appeared. No one 
                         has ever understood why...

               We hear a BELL-LIKE TONE, a single lingering high note, and 
               simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor 
               begins to glow brightly. It is an intense chromium yellow.

<b>               THE ASTRONAUTS
</b>
               Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the 
               circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the 
               outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally 
               reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo 
               blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter 
               here, like stars against a midnight sky.

<b>               THE MARTIAN
</b>
               Steps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in 
               particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle 
               of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core.

<b>               MCCONNELL
</b>
               Looks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first 
               time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as 
               abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes.

               Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden, 
               static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor.

               Even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the 
               relief in Phil's voice. And then the desperation.

               Suddenly the BELL-LIKE TONE REPEATS, at a lower register, 
               with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of 
               the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as

               She scoops up Luke's helmet, tosses it to him. As he catches 
               it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they 
               came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become aware 
               that McConnell isn't with them. They turn back. He's still 
               rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of 
               the colored rings.

               McConnell doesn't turn.

                         What?

               Coming back, she sees how calm he is. How certain.

<b>                                     TERRI
</b>                         What are you talking about? We've 
                         got to get home.

<b>                                     MCCONNELL

                         see? That's what all this is for.
                              (McConnell gestures 
                              at the ship around 
                              them)
                         You were right Terri. This is an 
                         invitation. To follow them. To follow 
                         them home.

               He looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this 
               idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half 
               smile.

</b>                         I have to go. This is the mission 
                         now. To find out who we are. Isn't 
                         that why we came here? Like Maggie 
                         said, "To stand on a new world and 
                         look beyond it to the next one."

               Luke nods at the memory of Maggie's words. Terri remembers 
               too. McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them 
               both.

                         I wasn't even supposed to be here -- 
                         all the accidents, everything that 
                         got us to this point, it's just... 
                         it's just... I just know it's right.

               Terri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands.

                         gotta get back to the ERV and get 
                         off this planet. Now please go.

               Luke steps closer, looking at his old friend.

                         taking mine. Guess I'm a little 
                         jealous.

               They clasp hands for a moment. But in this moment is a 
               lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell.

               Luke nods, deeply moved. He turns away, picking up his helmet, 
               as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspoken 
               beat. Her eyes are glistening.

                         He would've wanted to go too, Jim.

               Terri smiles. She is starting on the road to recovery. She's 
               going to be okay.

                         made it without him.

               Terri nods. She digs into one of her suit's pockets, pulls 
               something out. She hands it to McConnell, and his fist closes 
               around it.

               McConnell smiles. Terri smiles back at him. Then she turns, 
               picks up her helmet, and crosses to where Luke has paused, 
               looking back.

               Luke and Terri exchange a final silent farewell with him, 
               then hurry away, into the darkness.

               Looks down at what Terri gave him.

               The hanger-like hatch has reopened, and Luke and Terri, 
               helmeted again, emerge from the Face. The leading edge of 
               the dust storm is upon them. They can't see much more than a 
               few meters.

               As they reach the rover, they hear, even in this chaos, that 
               the deep pulsing tone of the Face has started again. They 
               look at each other, uncertain what this means. But McConnell 
               is now beyond their help. Luke keys his mike.

               Phil gets no response. He is shaking, almost crying. He 
               hesitates, then starts hitting some keys.

               McConnell has shed his backpack, with its unneeded oxygen 
               tank. He steps cautiously onto the colored rings. Nothing 
               seems to happen. Moving further, he takes his place on the 
               indigo circle at their core. He looks at

<b>               THE GLOWING TAKE-OFF COUNTDOWN INDICATOR
</b>
               As it dips from orange into red; the BELL TONES are continuous 
               now, very deep and rapid.

<b>               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT
</b>
               The rover, with Luke and Terri inside, races away towards 
               the safety of the ERV, as the maelstrom boils over the Face 
               behind them. The sky is purplish black, thick with flying 
               debris and eerie lightning flashes. Towering billows of dust 
               chase them over the plain, nearly enveloping them as they 
               speed towards us, passing OUT OF FRAME.

<b>               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT
</b>
               McConnell reacts, surprised, as suddenly

<b>               A TRANSPARENT, GLASS-LIKE CYLINDER
</b>
               Begins to rise around him, swiftly and smoothly, coming up 
               from the circumference of the indigo circle.

               Then a second, identical cylinder -- the top half -- drops 
               down from somewhere overhead. The two sections meet and fuse 
               in a flash of light, containing McConnell inside them, as 
               neatly as if he were in a giant, transparent mailing tube.

<b>               MCCONNELL
</b>
               Fights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being 
               imprisoned? Or somehow protected? Either way, he's virtually 
               immobilized. In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can't 
               even move his arms. Only his head and neck can still shift.

<b>               INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

               Phil is going over his final pre-launch checklist, flipping 
               switches and pressing buttons. He looks at his

               Which reads "1350."

               His finger hovers over a "Fire" button. He licks his lips 
               nervously, squeezes his eyes shut, and hits the button.

               And the words: "IGNITION SEQUENCE INITIATED"

<b>               INT. MARTIAN SPACESHIP. NIGHT
</b>
               McConnell is straining inside the cylinder that surrounds 
               him, when something catches his attention. He arches his 
               neck, looking down.

<b>               A COBALT-BLUE TRANSPARENT LIQUID
</b>
               Is beginning to fill the cylinder! It swirls in, from some 
               unknown source, rising rapidly; already his lower boots are 
               covered.

<b>               MCCONNELL'S EYES
</b>
               Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder 
               but

<b>               HIS GLOVED HANDS
</b>
               Slide helplessly across the smooth surface.

<b>               MCCONNELL
</b>
               Looks down again.

<b>               THE COBALT LIQUID
</b>
               Is up to his knees. Now his thighs...

<b>               MCCONNELL
</b>
               Cranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher, 
               can he somehow climb to safety?

<b>               ABOVE HIM
</b>
               The entire "ceiling" of the Face is becoming translucent. He 
               can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising 
               into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself. 
               These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water 
               snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a 
               collision course.

               Luke drives the rover through the blinding storm, as Terri

               The Rover races towards us, the front of the storm chasing 
               it from behind, then completely overtaking the Rover. It 
               disappears from view!

<b>               INT. ERV COCKPIT. NIGHT

               Phil sits in the pilot's seat. He is looking at a computer 
               graphic that shows the engines readying to launch. With 
               resignation, he keys his mike.

               to compose himself, then keys his mike.

               FROM GROUND LEVEL we see that the coils of energy are rising 
               from the forehead of the Face, from its "third eye," spinning 
               and looping faster and faster, starting to form a vortex. 
               But unlike the wind vortex that killed the Mars One crew, 
               this is a vortex of fire. As we watch, more fiery streaks 
               begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin, 
               cheeks and temples. These all rush upwards, like lava flowing 
               uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face 
               itself and spiral into the atmosphere. The peak of the forming 
               vortex is already piercing the lowest layer of storm clouds, 
               causing a dark counter-swirl.

               Phil stands at the bottom of the ERV's ladder, gripping it 
               to steady himself, staring into the swirling dust.

               THE ROVER appears out of the dust and sand, the immense storm 
               seeming to chase it from behind. Luke and Terri climb out, 
               struggle towards him through the wind. Phil grips their hands, 
               helping them over to the ladder. He looks back, confused.

<b>               INT. MARTIAN SHIP. NIGHT
</b>
               LOOKING DOWN INTO THE CYLINDER, we see that the cobalt-blue 
               fluid has risen to McConnell's upper chest. Now it's at his 
               shoulders! It pours into his suit through his neck ring.

               He strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep 
               his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid.

               He sucks in deep desperate gulps of air, his head thrashing 
               from side to side. Then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth, 
               his nose, his forehead. His whole body is submerged!

               The level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top 
               of the cylinder.

<b>               MCCONNELL
</b>
               Squeezes his eyes shut, holding his breath. Not so much 
               fighting this anymore as simply floating in place, waiting 
               for his inevitable death...

               WIDEVIEW FROM ABOVE, as the energy vortex bends from side to 
               side, pushing back the swirling storm that surrounds the 
               Face. As the vortex coalesces its energy into a cylindrical 
               shape, we see through its center to a rising form -- the 
               Martian ship. It is a flattened convex circle whose matte-
               metallic angles replicate the "Face" imagery.

</b>
               As the Face burns away around us, the Martian ship begins to 
               rise and spin.

               The vortex is now a tight, rapidly spinning cylinder. As it 
               draws more and more power from the disintegrating Face, the 
               Martian ship in its center spins faster and faster.

<b>               MCCONNELL'S FACE
</b>
               Is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the 
               huge buildup of G-forces tears at his body. We're reminded 
               of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the 
               same thing about to happen to McConnell?

               His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his 
               lips. His last breath is nearly exhausted, it's being shaken 
               from his lungs.

               As we MOVE IN CLOSER ON HIS FACE, we suddenly see, with him, 
               a SERIES of rapid-fire, almost subliminal IMAGES FROM THE 
               PAST. We recognize each one. Previously, though, we saw them 
               as still photos; now they have movement, life, and we view 
               them from new and slightly different angles. These images 
               INTERCUT with glimpses of McConnell's pale, shaking, near-
               death face in the present...

</b>
               Under the Christmas tree, lifts his new model rocket from 
               its box. He turns to us, smiling joyfully. A blinding white 
               flash, and he disappears...

<b>               THE TEENAGED MAGGIE
</b>
               Is on her porch, under a night sky, bending down to the 
               eyepiece of a TELESCOPE. She looks up at us with a shy, proud 
               smile. A blinding white flash and she's gone...

               In flight suits, holding their helmets, stand on the wing of 
               a fighter jet. The radiant young couple turn to each other, 
               kissing. A blinding white flash and they vanish...

<b>               MAGGIE MCCONNELL
</b>
               In an astronaut's pressure suit, drifts rapidly towards us, 
               reeling in along a tether. A man's gloved hand is 
               outstretched, reaching for her. As she grips the hand, we 
               see her triumphant expression through her faceplate. A 
               blinding flash; she's gone...

<b>               MCCONNELL'S FACE - IN THE PRESENT
</b>
               Is shaking savagely; he is very near death. And then, all at 
               once, the SHAKING STOPS.

               Time itself seems to stop.

               McConnell opens his eyes, staring STRAIGHT AT US. And then, 
               fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his 
               mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. He can breathe 
               it.

               His eyes widen in surprise and understanding. He can breathe 
               it! This fluid will keep him alive! His whole body relaxes, 
               the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully 
               trusts this launch for the first time. And then, with his 
               eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...

<b>               BRIDAL VEIL IS LIFTED

               And REVEALS, in CLOSEUP, the beautiful face, the shining 
               eyes of MAGGIE McCONNELL. Beatific, eternal. She gazes 
               directly INTO CAMERA, then smiles...

               Smiles back.

               WIDE VIEW, FROM ABOVE, as the energy vortex changes from red-
               orange to blue-white. It ROARS with terrifying power as its 
               top starts to bend, angling like a telescope towards a 
               specific point in the stars. Then the Martian ship -- a 
               rounded darker form, little more than a blip within the vast, 
               blue-white column of energy -- shoots away from the surface, 
               leaving only a blacked crater where the Face had been.

               ANGLE FROM DEEP SPACE, LOOKING DOWN, as the Martian ship, 
               riding its blue-white column of energy, streaks up into the 
               vast blackness, like a narrowly focused spotlight piercing 
               the night. Down below, we can see the dust storm in all its 
               vastness still boiling orange and brown across the planet's 
               surface, which it now completely covers.

               As the Martian ship flashes by us, it passes another ship, 
               much smaller and slower, rising through the storm clouds on 
               a different trajectory. We recognize the familiar, comfortable 
               sight of the ERV.

<b>               PUSHING IN QUICKLY ON THIS.

               We see three figures in the cockpit.

               Luke, Terri and Phil are strapped in, with their acceleration 
               just starting to level off, when suddenly their cockpit 
               interior is starkly bathed in white light. They wince at the 
               unearthly radiance, shielding their faceplates with gloved 
               hands.

               Through their cockpit window, they watch the Martian ship 
               hurtle by them at a hundred times their speed.

               Luke nods. Their eyes are glistening. Luke's voice is a 
               whisper, both of prayer and farewell.

               Looking through the cockpit window we see the Martian ship 
               receding into the infinite distance of space -- a long blue-
               white scratch that in moments begins to fade. Finally it is 
               a tiny point of light, taking its place amongst the limitless 
               expanse of the star-filled heavens.
