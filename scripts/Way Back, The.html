</b>
          A slow, steady, downward view. The camera seemingly
          floats as the curve of the globe passes beneath.
          Beginning in the green jungles of Sikkim in Northern
          India it crosses the Himalayas, down into Tibet and
          beyond to China - the zigzag line of the Great Wall
          clearly visible. Then the Gobi desert is flowing
          beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives
          way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we
          are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and
          onward across forested hills and valleys. A sense of
          utter remoteness in this silent landscape. Then a tiny
          shaved patch within the primeval forest - a bald
          rectangle of ground, crisscrossed by faint probing
          lights. The camera slows, and hovers.

          Out of the blackness, the momentary glimpse of a barbed
          wire fence, lit by the combing fingers of a searchlight.
          Another angle, and the silhouette of distant timber
          buildings is briefly etched, before the light passes and
          all is again in darkness. Closer, on a canvas-sided
           barrack building - ghostly shadows projected on the wall.

<b>          3 INT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 3
</b>
           A long rectangular building, the walls lined with two
           tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal
           stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A
          dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16 
          to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear
          scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in
          prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian
          territories, still ear something of their national 
          costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners
          from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages
          drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of
          types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving
          and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each
          other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men
          are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or
          'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that
          has put them here.
          Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a
          group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk.
          These men look healthier, and are further distinguished
          by their tattoos.

          Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily
          tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth. His opponent,
          BOHDAN, older, and the 'Pakhan', the 'boss' of this
          criminal gang. Bohdan shuffles a deck of home-made
          cards.

          BOHDAN nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden
          suitcase - a glimpse of hoarded food. The minder puts
          his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of
          sausage. BOHDAN nods. The bread is placed beside the
          coat.

</b>          BOHDAN shuffles and deals. He separates his cards with
          the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid 
          plays, VALKA is left coat-less. 
          Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players,
          the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just
          entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder,
          SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other
          ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes
          three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes
          them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN.

          BOHDAN enjoying himself.

</b>          Throw in that crappy shirt you're 
          wearing and I might be tempted. 
          Smiles from the gang. VALKA knows he's being mocked but
          he's desperate. His eyes flick down to the sausage.
          Then he takes off his shirt. He sits bare-chested, a
          tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking
          across at STALIN on his right. BOHDAN deals, and again
          VALKA loses.
           VALKA's mate YURI places a padded prison jacket over his 
           bony shoulders, which he shrugs off irritably, then 
          offers to BOHDAN.

          A silence, the criminal gang sensing a showdown. There's
          something about SMITH, something steely, unpredictable.
          The fire crackles loudly. SMITH all the while holding

          lips. Then he casually reaches down as if to tuck his
          trousers deeper into his boots, reaches for something,
          and in one slow balletic movement, swings up and
          stretches out his hand to ANDREI, and ANDREI sobs and

          floor. None of the other prisoners move to help him, nor
          do they show any sign of concern, as VALKA places the
          knife back in his boot and returns to the game. YURI
          steps forward and strips the sweater from the dead man,
          handing it on to VALKA, who passes it to BOHDAN. BOHDAN
          examines it professionally, wipes a little blood off his

          the stones. Wider to see two PRISONERS, breath steaming
          from their mouths, as they work quickly and quietly to
          uncover the grave. The older of the two is KHABAROV,
          late thirties, the other, LAZAR, late twenties. Furtive
          looks over their shoulders as an occasional blade of
          light from the watchtower throws them into silhouette.

          the set of underwear for a hank of tobacco. KHABAROV
          having done the deal splits the tobacco with LAZAR.
          Moving quickly to complete a second deal, KHABAROV swaps
          half his share of the tobacco with another prisoner for
          two slices of bread. He waits until the last of the

          his eyes. He can hear a guard shouting outside, but he
          hesitates, carefully licking his fingers. He stares at

          watchtowers placed at regular intervals along the

          marching toward them on their way to work. They have
          their attendant guards and dogs and as the two columns

          ill looking 'old' prisoners and the comparative health of
          the 'new', could not be more apparent - 'Is this what we
          are to become?' on the faces of the 'new'. We glimpse
          some of those already established - they include BOHDAN,

</b>          The camp is being expanded, and everywhere are piles of
          cut timber, coils of wire, and work going on replacing
          old canvas-sided barracks with new timber ones.
          The Spring thaw has turned recently melted snow into
          slush, and duck-boards are hastily laid to allow the
          Commandant to cross to the assembled prisoners. He walks
          with his subordinate and LAZAR who is FOREMAN of the new
          camp construction. LAZAR carries a sheaf of plans, and
          the COMMANDANT stops, studies a drawing, then impatiently
          issues an order dismissing him.
          The COMMANDANT mounts a box, accepting a folder of
          documents from his subordinate, who has in turn received
          them from the escorting guard. The COMMANDANT surveys
          the prisoners before him. He's a man in his fifties with
          a bland but not unintelligent cast to his features.
          He looks up from the collection of documents in his hand.

          Later, the newly arrived prisoners exit the wash-house,
          heads and beards shaved. In the background a glimpse of
          others waiting their turn. To one side of the wash-
          house, a pile of their luggage. A couple of guards sort
          through their belongings, pocketing the odd item.
          JANUSZ, VOSS and KAZIK, heads shaved, exit the hut.
          JANUSZ's attention is caught by the men working on
          replacing the old stockade wall with a new double barbed-
          wire fence. The overseer, LAZAR, gives a signal and a
          section of the old wall falls to the ground.

          The prisoners move in a line toward an open window in the
          side of the kitchen building. Here, under the watchful
          eye of the cook - one of BODHAN's men - a single serve of
          thin soup is slopped into their metal bowls. One has no
          bowl, so he uses his hat.
          JANUSZ and his friends shuffle toward the window.
          Their attention is caught by a group of blind prisoners
          feeling their way along the side of the kitchen hut, a
          hand on the shoulder of the man in front.

          SMITH, a couple of places ahead in the line, turns on
          hearing English spoken.
          As JANUSZ moves forward he watches several wild-eyed men
          scrambling about in a pile of kitchen slops thrown into
          the mud by the kitchen door. They find here the odd
          scrap of food, or simply soak their fingers in the slime,
          then lick them clean.

</b>          SMITH, having been served, moves away, retrieving a
          hoarded slice of bread from within his jacket. He dips
          it into the soup, raises it to his mouth when a corner of
          the bread drops to the ground. One of the garbage-
          eaters, dives for it, but SMITH is too quick for him,
          placing a boot over the scrap of bread. JANUSZ watches
          as SMITH picks up the bread, cleans off the dirt and eats
          it, his every move watched by the starving man at his
          feet. JANUSZ offers the remainder of his soup to the man
          who greedily drinks it. SMITH and JANUSZ stare at each
          other.

          work harder or move faster. Death is casual here. A man

          BOHDAN, the overseer, moves amongst the various working
          gangs, measuring their completed piles of logs. JANUSZ's
          group are still only half way to a full quota. KHABAROV

          KHABAROV calls for them to follow him. He leads them at 
          a jog deeper into the trees - pointing out various shapes
          buried in fallen leaves and drifts of snow. He clears
          away the leaves and snow to reveal a pile of old grey cut
          timber.

          halt in an open snow-covered area. The column halts, the
          guards anxiously confer - 'to go back or continue on'?
          The prisoners shiver in the biting cold, some collapse,
          their fellow prisoners unwilling or unable to help them.
          JANUSZ and his friends find themselves near SMITH and
          watch as he hails a GUARD.

           have some forms to fill out.
           Could go badly for you.
          The GUARD dimly considers this. The prisoners begin to
          stir, some shouting out that they should turn back. The
          GUARD alarmed, orders the prisoners to the ground - other
          guards level their rifles as the mass of men lay down on
          the freezing ground. All but SMITH.

          The GUARD is about to leave when to his astonishment, and
          that of the other prisoners, SMITH begins to walk toward
          the forest edging the road. The GUARD draws his pistol.
          On the ground ZORAN lies beside JANUSZ, as they watch the
          unfolding drama.
          GUARD NO. 1 shouts for SMITH to return, others raise
          their rifles, waiting for his order to fire. He is
          conflicted, and after a tense moment gestures for them to
          lower their weapons.

          the trees! Shoot anyone who makes

          courage.

</b>          The men work frantically collecting fallen timber. SMITH
          watches as VOSS picks up a massive log, places it on his
          shoulder and carries it to where JANUSZ is supervising
          the building of their shelter. Most of the other
          prisoners have just piled snow up around bundles of
          sticks to make windbreaks, but JANUSZ is building
          something more elaborate. SMITH's eyes miss nothing as
          he notes JANUSZ's skill and the way the others work as a
          team under his direction.

          As the blizzard grows in intensity, JANUSZ reaches into
          his pocket for strips of pine-bark collected earlier. He
          hands them out to his companions. They watch as he chews
          on the bark. The others follow his example.
          Watching from a short distance away is GUARD NO. 1. He
          takes note of the group as future troublemakers.

</b>
          A labyrinth of twisting tunnels leading down into the
          frozen earth. Dim lights silhouette ghostly figures
          working with pick and shovel. Occasionally the muffled
          sound of a distant explosion as a gallery is blasted yet
          deeper. Mingling with these eerie sounds something more
          sinister - the hacking coughs of those who've done the
          most time in this frozen hell.
          The man working beside JANUSZ wields a pick, JANUSZ
          shovelling out the rock as it breaks up. The man pauses
          to light a smoke. His fingers have moulded themselves
          into the shape of his pick-handle - they are like hooks,
          the man unable to straighten his fingers. He holds the
          cigarette with the tips of his fingers, as if his hand
          was an artificial limb. JANUSZ looks around desperately,
          fighting off an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia.
          Despite the cold, sweat beads on his forehead.

<b>          32 INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MINE - DAY 32
</b>
          A man, enveloped in clouds of white steam, points a long
          pipe at the frozen rock and gravel - the heat making it
          easier for the pick and shovel men to dig. This is the
          'POINT-MAN', and he opens and shuts valves on the pipe-
          stem which regulates the hot steam that travels along
          pipes leading back to a primitive boiler. Men try to
          warm themselves by working near the POINT-MAN, and when
          the guards are not around they clutch the pipes in their
          hands gaining a few moments of precious warmth.
          SMITH knows how to work the system and has found a spot
          here working beside the POINT-MAN. He looks across to
          see JANUSZ staggering up the slope toward the distant
          mine entrance, where a guard can be seen silhouetted
          against the light. He watches a moment, something not
          right about JANUSZ. He lays his shovel aside and hurries
          after him.

          to his knees. He looks down, sees something on the
          ground.

<b>          JANUSZ'S VISION - DAY 
</b>           Something buried in the dirt and rubble - paving stones.
          He clears away the debris to reveal a stone path.
          Looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a
          hedge. His P.O.V. as he moves up the path to the gate.
          His unseen hand opens the gate. Now the view is of the
          path as he walks forward - a series of worn flagstones,
          then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door. A
          pan to the left of the door - to see a loose brick in the
          wall.

          adjoining tunnel.

          SMITH stares at him. He's delirious and begins to shake
          with cold. SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back
          to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands
          around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH
          bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to
          JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its
          effect.

           In the last minutes before lights out the would-be
           escapees make discreet preparations. Clothing and other 
           items are traded for food and tobacco. The COOK and 
           BOHDAN are at the center of the camp black-market and
           most of the trading is done with them. TOMASZ trades
           more pornographic sketches with BOHDAN while KAZIK tries 
           to trade his scarf for a pair of boots - his own being in 
           poor shape. VOSS sits beside him, and notices that KAZIK 
           does not look directly at his shoes or the scarf, but is 
          doing everything by feel. As they move away VOSS
          whispers to him.

          He is reluctant until SMITH produces a wristwatch from
          his boot. The strapless watch, of good make, settles the

          The wooden building creaks and heaves like a ship at sea
          as the storm builds into a fully fledged blizzard. The
          sounds of the sleeping men, the usual cries and groans,
          hacking coughs, all mix into the howl of the storm.
          CLOSE on the conspirators lying awake - SMITH, VOSS,
          KAZIK, TOMASZ and ZORAN. SMITH looks across to JANUSZ,
          catches his eye. A signal from JANUSZ, 'not yet'.
          KHABAROV too, is awake. He jumps at any unexpected
          sound, checks his horde of food in the hiding place at
          the base of his bunk, as if expecting at any moment to be
          attacked and robbed. He sees a shadow. Someone moving
          about near him, a look of terror on his face.

<b>          LATER,

          movement beside him, then a knife pressed against his
          throat. It's VALKA. He grins, steel-capped teeth, his
          cross dangling from his neck. JANUSZ goes still.

          But one thing I never gamble is my
          Wolf.
          He removes the knife from JANUSZ's throat, tilts the
          blade to show a wolf's head incised into the blade.

          Heavy snow still falling as shadowy figures run toward
          the wire. Shouted commands and the beam of a searchlight
          isolates them - not the fugitives, but a group of guards.
          They've found a gap in the wire. A great yelping and
          baying as the dog-handlers join them, releasing the dogs
          into the gap, then following them toward the distant

          Then seven fugitives, now including VALKA, weave in and
          out of the trees at a fast jog. Snow whirls about them,
          as, gasping for breath, they attempt to keep up with
          JANUSZ. In the rear KAZIK holds onto VOSS' rope belt,
          occasionally stumbling, but VOSS has him up and on his
          feet fast enough to keep up with the others.
          JANUSZ pauses briefly every now and then to study the 
          moss growing on the North side of tree-trunks, before

          A feeble light penetrates the forest as day begins. The
          snow still falling heavily as the men stumble into a deep
          depression, and facing a steep climb find they can go no
          further. KAZIK turns his face to the light. His sight
          is returning with the day and he nods gratefully to VOSS.
          In the deep stillness the sound of distant voices. They
          look about them. Hard to tell the direction of the
          sound. JANUSZ is on his feet - there's plenty of fallen
          timber but no obvious place to hide. He draws a circle
          in the snow, mimes digging to the others, then turns to
          VALKA, whispers.

          With a glance to the others he reluctantly draws his
          knife from his boot and passes it to JANUSZ.
          While the group furiously dig, JANUSZ collects and trims
          fallen timber. As the hole deepens, JANUSZ begins to
          make a trellis roof. The voices change direction. They
          go still. Are they surrounded? They resume their
          digging with greater intensity, the hole now more than a
          meter at its deepest, JANUSZ placing the branches to
          cover their hide.

</b>          Once upon a time, in the days of
          wooden ships, there was a great
          storm in far away seas. A
          merchant ship hurried toward big
          rocks, lightening in the sky, the
          waves as high as house-tops.
          Very, very cold, brrr! The ship
          smashed onto the rocks, the
          sailors cried in fear, called out
          to God, but they all drowned. All
          but one, Mr. Robinson Crusoe. He
          woke to find himself all alone on
          a desert island. For many years
          he lived without any human
          companions, until one day he saw
          something shocking! What was it?
          A human footprint. He was no
          longer alone. But was the
          stranger friend or foe? Another
          ship wrecked sailor? Or, a
          cannibal?
          All turn as a flicker of flame begins at the base of the 
          kindling. While JANUSZ blows at the flame, MR. SMITH 
          feeds in small shavings. The group watch with the awe 
          and wonder usually reserved for child-birth. Then
          everyone is making a contribution - adding a few leaves,
          or tiny twigs, like offerings, as the fire grows and
          spreads.

          lands on the fire. The others react. It's JANUSZ. He
          heaps on more snow and the fire sputters out.
          By the time the others are on their feet JANUSZ is almost

          No one moves. JANUSZ reaches into his own pockets,
          emptying the contents onto the cloth - several slices of
          bread, half a kilo of buckwheat, some dried meat, a
          swatch of tobacco. SMITH goes next with a larger store
          of bread and a little salt. VOSS has a collection of
          small fish-heads which he adds to the store. TOMASZ,
          KAZIK and ZORAN make their contributions. They stare
          grimly at their limited food supply. Various other items
          are added - a razor blade, a length of cord, a piece of

          at the others, then passes it to him. TOMASZ has already
          begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of
          VOSS's fish heads on each. one. He hands them out. They
          eat in silence, savoring every bite. ZORAN removes the
          fish-head, passing it back to TOMASZ. Then he places a
          thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape. He eats
          daintily, his little finger extended like a dowager at a

          still light, and his desire to contribute, returns with a
          load of wood, turning back into the forest for more.
          Others gather wood, and as the light fades, begin to take
          up positions by the growing fire, roll cigarettes, etc.
          VOSS looks anxiously for KAZIK. He has not returned.

          the click of the gate latch, the flagstones at his feet
          as he moves down the path. (All the while the
          accompanying sound is of JANUSZ's laboured breathing in
          the present 'reality'). He's at the front door, camera

          work he skims fat from the pot filled with boiling bones,
          and lays out strips of meat given to him by VALKA to dry
          in the sun, part of the jerked meat they will carry as a
          long term food supply.
          VALKA; With the 'Wolf' he separates sinews and tendons
          from the beast, to form much needed bindings for their
          journey. He also cuts meat for their jerked supply, or
          to be smoked.

          suit on a driftwood hanger and is seen brushing it with a
          branch from a pine tree. TOMASZ teases him and suggests
          he do something useful. Later this leads to him sorting
          the boiled bones into various sizes, a sort of accountant
          of the 'bone-bank'. 'Customers' come to him looking for
          bones or teeth for various uses.
          JANUSZ; Works on the reindeer skin. With SMITH's help he
          stretches it to dry on a driftwood frame. Later, he cuts
          a piece off and gives it to VOSS for the back-pack. He
          also works scraping the skin of strands of unwanted meat
          and fat.
          IRENA; Sleeps and eats. It is only at dusk one day she
          seems to come to life and moving to the lakeside washes
          her clothes and hair. The men try not to stare, and
          whether their thoughts are carnal or not, whether she
          reminds them of family or girlfriend, they are all
          affected by her transformation from boy/urchin, into a

          Refreshed and revived and laden with their supplies from
          the deer, they make their way along a narrow dirt track
          by the lake. IRENA is aware that the main opposition to
          her joining with them comes from VALKA and SMITH. SMITH
          she knows is the more important, and she tries to keep up
          with him. Occasionally catching his eye, she tries to
          charm him with a coquettish smile beyond her years.

          walk along the edge to where the river begins to narrow,
          but here it's still frozen, and a quick test with
          JANUSZ's staff shows it to be too thin to take their
          weight. They look upstream - a distant figure of a man,
          a hunter possibly, a shotgun over his shoulder, on their
          side of the bank. There's clearly no choice but to swim
          for it. They make hasty preparations, removing outer
          clothing, except shirts and trousers, tying their boots
          about their necks. IRENA watches.

<b>                         SMITH
</b>          Can you swim?

<b>                         IRENA

<b>                         IRENA
</b>          I'm not lying, Comrade.
          That was a slip of the tongue, and SMITH is made uneasy
          by it.

<b>                         SMITH
</b>          And don't call me, 'comrade'.
          With a shout the group plunge into the icy water,
          swimming one-handed, their packs held above water level
          in the other. It's only when they reach the other side
          they realize IRENA is still on the opposite bank. The 
          others urge her to swim across. She hesitates a moment
          then runs upstream to where the river is frozen.

          bounds she's out on the ice heading for the opposite
          bank. Ice cracks beneath her feet and a couple of times
          it seems she'll fall in, but with a last great leap over
          a section of free-flowing water she makes it to the other
          side, hurrying down to join the others a broad smile on
          her face. She looks defiantly at SMITH. JANUSZ is
          worried about the man having seen them, and urges them to 
          follow him into the tree-line.

           They scramble up a steep, forested slope, with occasional

          force her to jog occasionally to keep up. They swat at

          afraid and hid me in the barn.
          The mosquitos are getting worse and SMITH grabs swatches

          away at the annoying insects.

           cars, but its soon apparent their cargo is human. From 
           the high windows, hands can be seen clutching the bars.
           From inside a communal groaning and sighing. Voices, 
           female voices, cry out for water, and on the agonized 
           faces of the fugitives a mixture of pain and empathy.
           Then the train seems to sigh, like a great beast, and
           from beneath the carriages flow streams of blood and
           urine. As the distant light turns green the train slowly 
           moves forward, and as it does so, letters and notes drop
           to the tracks from the barred windows.
           After it is gone they scramble over the tracks into the

          Sleeping figures. A gentle tip-tapping sound. VOSS
          opens his eyes. Staring back at him from the doorway,
          half a dozen sheep. He nudges TOMASZ who wakes sleepily,
          takes his eye-line. Carefully, slowly, they rise, VOSS
          drawing his deer-bone knife. Then they move. The sheep
          retreat, bumping into each other, and outside the chase
          is on. TOMASZ tackles a ewe and VOSS approaches with a
          knife, but JANUSZ is behind him, grabs his arm.

          They break into Polish, a blazing argument, months of

          it inside the ruin.

          TOMASZ and ZORAN play a long distance walker's game -
          each in turn kicking a rock out ahead, continually
          passing it from one to the other.
          JANUSZ and SMITH look to the hills surrounding them as

          By the size of the compound, several hundred monks may
          have lived here. Everywhere are signs of violence -
          doors hang from hinges, and a large statue of Buddha lies

          As they head South, each is lost in their own thoughts
          when seemingly out of nowhere a half-dozen Mongolian
          horsemen are galloping toward them. The horsemen circle
          them, far from friendly looks on their faces. They wear
          the traditional costume of Steppe nomads and range in age
          from a man in his seventies down to a six-year-old boy.
          The OLD MAN pulls up his horse in front of SMITH,
          figuring as he's the oldest he'll also be the leader.
          The groups stare at each other. The OLD MAN speaks in
          Russian, a rough guttural accent.

          The OLD MAN maybe doesn't get the 'American' part, but he
          gets that they are not Russian. He seems pleased about
          that.

          IRENA moves closer to him. SMITH puts a protective arm
          about her shoulder. The OLD MAN considers the situation
          for a moment longer before abruptly turning, and followed
          by his band, galloping off toward the distant hills.
          Looks between the group, not exactly of relief, as
          there's a feeling it may not be the last they see of the
          riders. IRENA looks up at SMITH, smiles at him.
          Something about him calling her his daughter has touched
          some hidden place. SMITH, a little embarrassed, smiles
          back.

          While SMITH fishes in the river, others tend to their

          improvised deer skull container. This they rub over raw
          patches, and between their toes where deep cracks have
          developed. JANUSZ repairs their footwear, while TOMASZ
          sits by the fire sketching IRENA. ZORAN, the camp

          JANUSZ begins scooping out a hole in the pebbly ground.
          It's funnel-shaped, narrow at the base. The others watch
          as he lines the sides with dried deerskin, placing their
          cooking pot in the base.

          out in a line, no-one speaking, all just dully
          concentrating on placing one foot after the other. ZORAN
          notices VOSS, walking behind him is actually asleep. He
          has swung his backpack onto his chest and with his head
          resting on it he is actually sleep-walking. ZORAN tests
          his theory by walking away from the group, in a small
          circle. VOSS follows, guided by the sound of ZORAN's
          footsteps. He wakes him, VOSS looking around with a
          start.

          rise. From here he has a clear view to the horizon. Off
          in the distance a dark patch against the light sand.
          Through the dancing mid-day light he sees shapes. Trees?

          SMITH nods reassuringly then quickly turns away, a look 
          of deep anguish passing across his face.

          passes around a splash of water in the cup. They all
          refuse it.

          And he pops one in his mouth, makes out it's delicious
          and soothing.
          In the now familiar ritual they scoop out holes in the
          sand, lining them with their jackets, hopeful of
          collecting a little moisture overnight.

          IRENA starts to fall forward, they steady her, and she
          walks on for a bit before slumping forward, and falling
          to her knees. SMITH too falls with exhaustion. VOSS
          hurries back to them.

          Smith?
          SMITH struggling for breath is back on his feet, waving
          them on. VOSS and JANUSZ each put an arm about her and
          half-carrying, half-dragging her, they set off again but
          it's no use, she's lost all her strength.

          As the volume builds he runs for his life. A beetle too,
          has heard it and burrows into the sand as a foot in a
          battered moccasin looms large in frame. We follow the
          foot a few staggering steps, then a blur, as a body falls
          through frame, ending in a close-up of TOMASZ, his breath

          CLOSE on TOMASZ.
          He pulls the leg of his trousers up with difficulty - the
          tell-tale swelling of the ankles, just as with IRENA. As
          JANUSZ approaches he quickly covers his legs and staggers

          As they walk the landscape changes from the endless
          scrubby plain to sweeping sand dunes. The nature of the
          terrain makes the going slower and they move forward on
          the edge of exhaustion. In a curious freak of Nature the
          wind whips across the top of the dunes creating an eerie
           singing sound. Ahead, and across their path a massive 
           dune - no way forward but over it. TOMASZ looks up,

          down, a smile on his face. He looks up at the stars. He
          knows he's dying and has accepted the fact. This in turn

          not even entirely sure it's real. He watches its
          progress as it slithers up the rocky hillside. Then he

          Next morning, and the figures of the four men are seen in
          wide-shot sleeping by the embers of their fire. One
          figure gets up, picks up his staff, and begins to walk
          slowly South, toward the distant mountains. It's SMITH.
          The others stir, their attention caught by the sight of
          SMITH staggering onward. JANUSZ knows what the effort to
          walk is costing him, and he knows this is SMITH's gift to
          him. They hurriedly pack up, VOSS cramming the back-pack
          with roasted snake-meat, ZORAN collecting a last bowl of
          water, which he pours carefully into their goatskin water-
          bag.

          JANUSZ catches up with SMITH, giving him his arm in

          fingers; another submerges himself entirely; one drinks,
          savoring every mouthful as if it were the finest vintage
          wine. SMITH fishes. Beside him several of his catch

          It is snowing. VOSS is the first to rise. He looks
          about him in disbelief, shakes the others awake,
          pointing. Just beyond where they've slept a high wall
          towers above them. In this extreme Western section it's
          in poor shape - not built of stone, but of ancient mud
          bricks, tumbled down in many places, but to the East the
          outline is distinct as it straggles over ridges to the
          horizon - the Great Wall of China.

          From his P.O.V., four distant figures walking across the

          associated outbuildings. THE SHEPHERD dismounts and with
          much bowing opens the door for two other Tibetans who
          follow. One is a LPMA, the other a local OFFICIAL. They
          stoop as they enter - a glimpse inside to where the four

          CLOSE on JANUSZ. He's wide awake. No thought of sleep.

</b>
          ZORAN and VOSS agitated at the discovery that JANUSZ has
          gone. Much coming and going in and out of the hut,
          checking that he isn't somewhere close by. Only SMITH
          remains undisturbed as he sits with his back against the
          wall, the ghost of a smile on his lips. He expected
          nothing less. 

<b>          217 EXT. HIMALAYAS - DAY 217
</b>
          Up ahead a figure, JANUSZ, dwarfed by the mountain chain,
          struggles on, climbing toward the snow-capped passes.

<b>          218 EXT. HIGHER PASS DAY 218
</b>
          As he climbs he hears a cry, mingling with that of the
          wind - a voice echoing about the mountains. He ignores
          it for a few paces, before he looks back - far below two
          figures waving and calling - VOSS and ZORAN.

<b>          219 EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE/VALLEY, TIBET/INDIA - DAWN 219
</b>
          The change from the barren mountains of Tibet, to the
          lush green of Sikkim is abrupt and startling - from rocky
          upper reaches the slope to the valley becomes rich in
          scrubby birch-woods, rhododendrons, and deciduous forest,
          until finally it becomes dense rain forest. It is with a
          backdrop of this luxuriant green that Indian faces look
          up toward the slopes. Here they watch three wild looking
          bearded men descending toward them. The additional cost
          of this final leg of their journey is plainly visible on
          their faces, and in their slow stumbling movements. They
          walk like automatons, only their senses fully alive.
          Shouts from the locals produce a village ELDER, then a
          POLICEMAN. Older children squeal with delight, while
          some of the very young cry out in fear, one even bursting
          into tears - are these the dreaded Yeti their
          grandfathers told them lived up in the mountain peaks?

          Close on JANUSZ, VOSS, and ZORAN as the beaming POLICEMAN
          escorts them past dozens of smiling faces.

</b>          This being India, a small crowd of the curious rapidly
          swells, until the path is lined two and three deep on
          either side, like a welcoming crowd at the end of a
          marathon. Small children are held up for a better look,
          while hands reach out patting their backs and shoulders -
          it's as if they know these men have achieved something
          remarkable.
          Close on JANUSZ, as amongst the sound of the gathering
          crowd other voices join in, cheering voices, hundreds of
          them, rising in volume until the cheering changes into
          that of a chant, now seemingly swelled by thousands of
          voices. Still CLOSE on JANUSZ walking as behind him the
          Indian scene dissolves into a series of black and white
          images. (Throughout, the image of JANUSZ walking is from
          this scene in India).

          The camera moves toward a gate in a hedge. The click of
          the latch as it opens. A downward view of the
          flagstones. The front door, the camera pans left. The
          loose brick. A hand into frame removes a key from behind
          the brick. Into the lock of the door, the door pushed

          A WOMAN sitting by a window. She's in her early
          seventies, and she looks up expectantly on hearing the
          door closing in the hallway. At the entrance to the room
          appears a young man in Polish cavalry uniform - YOUNG
          JANUSZ, as he was just before the war. He smiles at his
          wife. Cut back to the seat by the window to see his
           pretty YOUNG WIFE, as she was back in 1939. YOUNG
           JANUSZ, smiling broadly, crosses toward her. Cut back to
          his WIFE of 1989 - on her face there are lines of
           suffering which fade as she smiles up at him. She's
           waited a long time for him to come home. On JANUSZ now
           as he sits opposite her, and for the first time we see
          him as he is in 1989 - also in his early seventies.
           Without a word he reaches across the table and takes her
          hand in his.
