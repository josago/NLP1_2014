<b>          1 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - PREDAWN 1
</b>
           ELLIS(14) sits fully-clothed on top of his made bed. He is a
           wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip
           struggling desperately to be a mustache.
           His room, cluttered with junk, is dark, quiet and tiny. A
           backpack and an oversized Walkie-Talkie sit next to him.
           The silence is cut by a SQUAWK from the Walkie. Ellis
           quickly grabs it.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I'm comin' out now.

           He crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over his
           shoulder. On his feet, he slides open a window at the foot
           of his bed. He's out in one motion.

<b>          2 EXT. HOUSEBOAT - PREDAWN 2
</b>
           Ellis skirts alongside the exterior wall of his room on a two-
           foot-wide section of decking.
           He lives on a HOUSEBOAT anchored just off the bank of the
           Arkansas River. The "boat" is really the combination of a
           double wide trailer and a vinyl-sided shack fused together
           atop large flotilla.
           Ellis scurries to the mobile home section of the boat. He
           slips past a barbecue grill and settles underneath a lighted
           window. VOICES come from inside.
           Slowly, Ellis gets on his toes to peer through the window.

<b>          3 INT. ELLIS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 3
</b>
           MARY LEE(41) takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator.
           SENIOR(52) sits at a small table reading a newspaper. The
           mobile home kitchenette is no larger than Ellis' room.

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           I just want to have a conversation.
           I just want to talk about it.

           Mary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up
           from his paper. Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger
           toward him.

<b>           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
</b>           If you don't look up from that
           goddamn paper...

           She stops before completing the thought.
           After a moment, Senior lowers his paper. He stares across
           the table at his wife. He looks at her with true disdain.

<b>           2.
</b>
                         
           His eyes trace down her face and robe before finally settling
           on his cup of coffee. He picks up the cup, takes a sip, and
           sets it back on the table. He raises the paper up.
           Mary Lee's eyes soften. She bites the inside of her cheek to
           keep from crying. Her eyes move to the kitchen window.

<b>          4 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 4
</b>
           Ellis quickly ducks and mouths the word "shit."
           He slips under the window toward a metal carport that covers
           a boat, fish cleaning station, and industrial ice machine.
           The entire houseboat is anchored to the shore by two thick
           ropes tied to opposite ends of the flotilla. The ropes
           extend upward into the tops of enormous pine trees.
           Ellis sprints across a simple, wood-planked bridge to shore.
           His houseboat is one of several in a row along the riverbank.

<b>          5 EXT. ELLIS' RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 5
</b>
           Ellis scurries into the treeline and arrives at a dirt path.
           Waiting for him there is NECKBONE(14), a scrawny kid with
           slicked back blonde hair wearing a FUGAZI T-shirt. He sits
           atop a smallish dirt bike. Ellis hops on the back.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What the shit man?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Suck it. Drive.
           The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail.

<b>          6 EXT. RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 6
</b>
           From a distance, the single headlight of the dirt bike snakes
           up and down, in and out of trees along the riverbank.

<b>           ON THE BIKE,
</b>           The sound of the engine rips through fog and trees
           illuminated by the straining headlight.

<b>          7 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAWN 7
</b>
           The boys emerge from behind a sand covered hill. Now on
           foot, they are silhouetted against a light blue, morning sky.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           How old is she?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           A Junior.

<b>           3.
</b>
                         
           At a collection of trees growing out of the water, the boys
           move branches away from a tarp covered boat.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           She's got nice titties. You talk
           to her?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Nah.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           You're gonna have to talk to her.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I know.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Remind me when we get back to my
           house, Galen's got a book on that.
           Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small, flat-bottom
           boat. Ellis, a foot on the bank and one in the boat,
           launches them out into the water.

<b>          8 EXT. RIVER - MORNING 8
</b>
           A chunk of Neckbone's greased back hair bobs in the wind as
           they cruise down river. Ellis steers a small 15 horsepower
           motor. An orange sun is coming up now.
           Neckbone's eyes lock on what's in front of them. Ellis kills
           the motor. Neckbone stands up, a serious look on his face.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Shit.
           Ellis raises up behind him. He takes a deep breath, nods.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           Your dad'd kill us he knew we went
           out there.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I'm not worried about my dad
           killin' us.
           THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER sprawls out in front of them. It's
           enormous.
           Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas, a small river
           by comparison. The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown
           water and yellow foam six football fields wide.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What if it sinks?

<b>           4.
</b>
                         

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           It ain't gonna sink. We gotta move
           if we're gonna make it back. Set
           your watch. We'll need a good
           fifteen minutes.
           Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch. They
           take their seats. Ellis cranks the motor.
           The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river.

<b>          9 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - MORNING 9
</b>
           The boat lurches through the murky, rushing water.
           Neckbone has both hands firmly planted on the boat's edges.
           Ellis tries to handle the motor which has little impact
           against this current.
           The tail end of the boat swings to the right. Ellis flinches
           and grabs an edge to steady himself. The front of the boat
           bobs toward an ISLAND in the middle of the river.
           Neck turns to Ellis and points.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>
<b>           THERE IT IS!
</b>
<b>          10 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 10
</b>
           The boys splash down in ankle deep water. They take hold of
           the front of the boat and drag it onto the muddy shore.
           Neckbone jogs to a tree line in the center of the island.
           Ellis snatches up his backpack and follows.

<b>          11 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - CONTINUOUS 11
</b>
           The island, only 60 some yards in diameter, is separated by a
           clump of tall trees that form a wooded area in its center.
           The trees make it so you can't see from one side of the
           island to the other.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Galen thinks it's been here awhile.
           Thinks the last flood did it.
           Ellis follows as Neckbone winds through the trees. They stop
           at a deep creek that cuts across the island. Neckbone looks
           to his right, then his left. Sees what he's looking for.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           It's down there.
           A fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek. Ellis starts
           across.

<b>           5.
</b>
                         

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           Hold it.
           Neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           Look.
           Eight feet below the tree trunk, a nest of water moccasins
           curl around in the creek. Neckbone drops the stone on top of
           them. The snakes fan out.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           Little shits.
           Their mud-caked high-tops stomp across the trunk.

<b>          12 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - DAY 12
</b>
           The boys stop near the base of a large tree and stare up.
           Ellis cranes his neck back. Awestruck.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           So there it is.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Yeah, there it is.
           A 26 Foot Long BOAT sits nestled in the tree limbs above.

<b>          13 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - MOMENTS LATER 13
</b>
           The boys scale up the tree from low lying branches.
           Ellis, hands on the edge of the boat, gets a leg over the
           side and pulls himself onto the deck. He reaches down and
           helps to drag Neckbone on board.
           They get to their feet, steadying themselves on the wooden
           deck. It's solid. They take in their new vantage point.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           It came down from up there.
           Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off.
           Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head
           over. He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Motor broke off.
           Ellis isn't concerned with the motor. His eyes are locked on
           a covered cabin at the front of the boat.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Who else knows about this?

<b>           6.
</b>
                         

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Just me and Galen.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           What's he think?

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           He don't care about it.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Good.
           Ellis walks to the cabin. He pushes a vinyl door open.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
</b>           'Cause this boat's ours.
           Ellis has to duck down to go inside. Neckbone follows.

<b>          14 INT. BOAT CABIN - CONTINUOUS 14
</b>
           Ellis, stooping over, makes his way into the tiny cabin room.
           Yellow floral curtains, stained with age, cover a row of
           windows that wrap around the top of the cabin. These provide
           an odd glow in an otherwise dark, wood paneled space.
           There is a bench with rotted out cushions to the left. To
           the right, a mold-covered sink and mirror.
           Neckbone peers over Ellis' shoulder at the front of the cabin
           room. A small booth sits to the right across from a
           miniature toilet partially shielded by an open door.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           It's got its own shitbox
           Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light
           streams in. He starts opening small closets and drawers.
           Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           This is perfect.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Ho-Lee-Shit.
           Neckbone stares in an open drawer. He removes a stack of
           Playboys from the 1980's.
           Ellis smiles at him. He leans back and props his foot
           against the sink cabinet across from him. This is home.
           Neckbone opens the first Playboy. It disintegrates.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           Aw shit.

<b>           7.
</b>
                         
          As he scrambles to gather the fallen pages, Ellis notices a
          dried BOOT PRINT next to his foot. He lowers his shoe from
          the cabinet leaving a smaller, muddy print of his own.
          He leans in to examine the larger print. The impression of a
          CROSS has been left in the heel.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           Her tits are so small.
          Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the
          cross marking. His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin.
          On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty
          cans of Beanie Weenie. In the booth, he sees a grocery bag.
          Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Neck.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Look at that beave. You gotta see
           this.
          Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag. His fingers pull back
          the edges to reveal its contents: one can of unopened Beanie
          Weenie and half a loaf of BREAD.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Neck.
          Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze. It's
          FRESH. Ellis freezes.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Someone's here.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What?
          Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Someone's livin' here.
          Neckbone sees the grocery bag. His eyes widen. The boys are
          stone frozen. They listen for other sounds. Silence.

<b>          BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
</b>          Both boys flinch at the sharp sounds. Neckbone's hand flies
          to cover the alarm on his wristwatch.

<b>           8.
</b>
                         

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Shit.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           We gotta go. I can't be late.

<b>          15 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - MOMENTS LATER 15
</b>
           They drop out of the tree and hit the ground running.

<b>          16 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - MOMENTS LATER 16
</b>
           The boys' feet rush across the tree trunk bridging the creek.

<b>          17 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - MOMENTS LATER 17
</b>
           They launch out of the treeline and sprint to their boat.
           Neckbone grabs the side and starts pushing the boat to the
           water. Ellis slings his backpack in and joins him.
           Suddenly, Ellis straightens up, leaving Neckbone to struggle.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What are you doing?
           Ellis stares at a muddy boot print, cross in the heel,
           stamped in the center of their boat. He looks back to the
           treeline, then down the shore. He looks to his feet.
           The boys' shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud.
           Larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)

<b>                          ELLIS

<b>                          (POINTING)
</b>           I saw that same boot print up in
           the tree. It has a cross in the

</b>           Shit. Let's go.
           Ellis begins following the boot prints around the shoreline.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           We gotta go if you wanna make it
           back.

<b>           9.

          Ellis stops and points ahead of them.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Up there. They stop.
          Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print.
          They appear to vanish.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Where the hell'd he go?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I don't know.
          Neckbone turns and freezes. A MAN has appeared in the
          distance behind Ellis. He stands between the boys and their
          boat.
          Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns. He
          flinches at the sight of the Man.
          MUD(38) stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's
          fishing pole with cartoon characters on it. He stares back
          at them and casts his fishing line into the water.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Shit. You know that guy?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I've never seen him before.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Shit.
          Mud, not taking his eyes off the boys, slowly reels in his
          line. His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of
          growth on his face.
          With a cigarette clinched, he cracks a smile revealing a
          MISSING CANINE. He holds a hand in the air as if to wave.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           Shit.
          Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back. Mud wears
          jeans and cowboy boots. His filthy button-up shirt looks
          like it hasn't left his body in years.
          He breaks his stare with the boys. Continuing to reel in his
          line, he walks over to them.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           What you say?
          The boys don't respond. Mud walks past them and casts again.

<b>           10.
</b>
                         

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           What's that?
          Mud takes the cigarette from his mouth. A tattoo of a
          snake's head covers the top of his right hand. Two large
          cotton blossoms spill out of its jaws.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Boat in the trees. It's a helluva
           thing.
          Mud continues walking down the shoreline, reeling in his
          bait. The boys follow, tentatively.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           You talkin' 'bout our boat?

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I'm talkin' about my boat.

<b>                          NECKBONE

<b>                          MUD

           Possession is nine tenths of the
           law.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           So?

<b>                          MUD

           Mississippi?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           No.
          They watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and
          spits on it. Then, tucking the pole under his arm, he ties a
          lock of his hair into a knot. He finishes this process with
          another cast.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)

           into a werewolf but that's a lie.
           I don't know nothin' about that.
          Ellis, confused, won't take his eyes off the man.

           What's your name?
          Mud seems easy to smile, which softens his otherwise coarse
          look. His words spill from the mouth rapidly, without much
          thought for punctuation. Neckbone, emboldened by these
          facts, steps forward to answer.

          Neckbone looks at Ellis, frustrated by his friend.

</b>           Arkansas boys. Ya'll had me
           worried for a second.
          Mud, pleased by this news, tucks the fishing pole under his
          arm and holds out a hand to shake. Ellis stares at the hand,
          unsure. He takes it reluctantly.

<b>                          ELLIS

          Neckbone can't believe his friend is offering this up.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Ellis. We gotta go.

          Mud smiles.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Ain't that somethin'.
          In one motion, Mud flicks his cigarette away and grabs a pack
          out of his shirt pocket.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)

</b>           This guy's a bum Ellis. Come on.
          Mud's smile vanishes. Neckbone begins to walk off but
          begrudgingly stops when Ellis starts back in.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Why don't you go get your own food?

           stuck for now and what I got's
           runnin' low.
           Neckbone walks back and pulls Ellis by the arm.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           He's a bum Ellis, let's go.
           Mud lays a serious look down on Neckbone.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I'm no bum. I got money. You can
           call me a hobo `cause a hobo'll
           work for his living and you can
           call me homeless `cause that's true
           for now, but if you call me a bum
           again I'll have to teach you
           somethin' about respect that your
           daddy never did.
           Neckbone's confidence recedes. Ellis stands his ground.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           When they show up, you'll leave?
           Mud begins fishing again.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           And when you leave, that boat's
           ours?

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Yeah.
           Ellis studies Mud's face, clothes, tattoos. He's thinking
           about it. Mud pauses from fishing to make eye contact.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)

           little help.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           We gotta go.
           With that, Ellis turns to leave. The boys walk briskly back
           to their boat. Ellis looks over his shoulder to see Mud
           making another cast with his fishing pole.

           Senior heaves an enormous, white cooler into the bed of his
           weathered pick-up truck.
           The truck is parked at an angle on a concrete boat ramp next
           to their houseboat. The bed of the truck is jam-packed with
           six of the big, white coolers.
           The SOUND of a dirt bike rattles through the trees. Senior
           looks up, wiping his brow with a handkerchief.
           Ellis leaps out of the treeline and runs to the pick-up. His
           hands hit his knees, out of breath.

<b>                          ELLIS

           Senior flips up the tailgate. Ellis hops up the wheel well
           and into the bed of the truck. He steadies himself on one of
           the coolers as his father pulls away.

           Senior is up front wolfing down a cheeseburger.
           A GROUP of TEENAGERS are gathered around a CLUSTER of parked
           cars in the corner of the lot. They meander between the
           vehicles, smoking, gossiping, passing around a bottle of
           Boone's Farm. Ellis watches them.
           MAY PEARL(16) appears in the middle of the Group laughing
           with her GIRLFRIENDS. She's pretty and physically more
           mature looking than Ellis.
           He watches as a SKINNY KID takes his ballcap off and puts it
           on May Pearl's head. She sniffs the cap, gags and tosses it
           back at him. Her friends laugh.

           his head when he sleeps.
           He reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a fold of

<b>          23 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - DAY 23
</b>
           Neckbone sits on the front steps of his trailer reading a
           comic book. The muffled sound of the Beach Boys' "Help Me
           Rhonda" plays off a record inside.
           Senior's truck pulls away as Ellis walks up the entrance to
           the trailer park.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What book?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           You said Galen had a book might
           help me out.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Aw, yeah. We gotta give it a
           minute. You hear that music?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           That means he's doin' it. That's
           his doin' it song.
          Ellis takes a seat next to Neckbone. They listen to the
          song, slightly craning their necks to pick up on any other
          sounds. There are none.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           You know who it is?

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Whoever's drivin' that white Dodge.
          Neckbone motions to a beat up Dodge Shadow in the yard.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           You tell Galen 'bout this morning?

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Nah. You tell anybody?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           No.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           That guy was crazy.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Maybe. I don't know. I think he
           just needed some help.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Well he can swim his ass off that
           island and get some.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I think I'm gonna go back, take him
           some food.

<b>           18.
</b>
                         

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Why?
          Suddenly, the music from inside stops. Footsteps approaching
          and the trailer door flies open, almost hitting the boys.
          A GIRL(28) bursts out down the steps, straight to her car.
          She wears tight jean-shorts and is buttoning a white shirt.
          She stops and turns back to the boys.

<b>                          GIRL
</b>           You're Neckbone right?

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                          GIRL
</b>           You look like a good enough kid. A
           word of advice, don't grow up to be
           like your shit heel uncle.
          The boys can't take their eyes off her cleavage revealed
          under her half-buttoned shirt. A necklace with three
          misshapen pearls hangs from her neck.

<b>                          GIRL (CONT'D)
</b>           Hey!
          She snaps the boys' attention up to her eyes.

<b>                          GIRL (CONT'D)
</b>           You hear me? You treat a woman
           like a princess. Got it?!

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Yeah.
          The trailer door opens and GALEN(36) emerges. He's a big,
          lumbering guy wearing a full-body wet suit pulled halfway
          down. A faded mermaid tattooed in the middle of his chest.

<b>                          GALEN
</b>           Come on baby.

</b>
<b>           I'M A GODDAMN PRINCESS!!!
</b>          The Girl yanks off the necklace and hurls it at Galen. He
          brushes fingers through his thick mustache.

<b>                          GALEN
</b>           That's uncalled for.
          He walks out to her. She heads for the Dodge Shadow.

           Ellis sees one of the misshapen pearls at his feet. He picks
           it up and holds it to the sun.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Pearls. Galen finds 'em in some of
           the mussel shells. Most of 'em
           ain't worth dick, but he likes to
           make necklaces for the girls. Come
           on, let's get that book.
           Neckbone walks into the trailer. Ellis stands up and
           retrieves the other two pearls out of the dirt. He crams
           them in his pocket and follows Neckbone inside.

<b>          24 INT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS 24
</b>
           The trailer is decorated in the filth of a true bachelor pad.
           Neckbone makes his way to a bedroom. He tosses clothes and
           trash around to get to what he's looking for. A cardboard
           box. He pulls the box onto the bed and sifts through.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           I don't want you goin' back out
           there by yourself. That river's

<b>                          (FINDS SOMETHING)

           He takes out a hardback book. The slip reads, "The Confident
           Confidant, communicating with the opposite sex."

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)

           things around for him.

           Ellis flips delicately through the manual.

<b>          25 EXT. NECKBONE'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS 25
</b>
           Galen watches as the Girl's Dodge Shadow pulls away. The
           boys step out of the trailer.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           You really going back out there?

</b>           Well...I'll be over in the mornin'
           then.
           Galen, his thumbs tucked under his armpits, walks back to the
           trailer. He passes the boys and notices the self-help book
           in Ellis' hands.

<b>                          GALEN

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           All right.
           Neckbone follows his uncle into the trailer. Ellis flips
           through his new book as he heads out of the trailer park.

<b>          26 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 26
</b>
           By the time Ellis makes it to his houseboat, the sun has
           disappeared behind the horizon.
           He crosses the make-shift plank and enters through a screen
           door by the carport.

<b>          27 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 27
</b>
           Mary Lee flinches when she sees Ellis come through the door.
           Her face is flushed. Senior stands toe to toe with her.
           They stare at Ellis, who has paused in the doorway. He
           doesn't say anything, just looks curiously at his parents.
           Senior storms past Ellis and is out the door.
           Ellis steps further into the den. Mary Lee tries to
           straighten herself, patting down her hair and dabbing at her
           eyes with the back of her hand.

<b>                          ELLIS

<b>           21.

           She walks into the kitchen keeping Ellis at her back. She
           turns on the sink and begins scrubbing at a dish.

<b>           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
</b>           Do you need me to fix you
           somethin'? Have you eaten?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I'm all right.
           Mary Lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the
           sink. She turns to Ellis.

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           I'm gonna turn in.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Okay momma.
           Mary Lee slips past him and enters her bedroom. The door
           closes and Ellis is left alone in the den. It's quiet. He
           waits, looking at the door his mother just closed.
           Ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door.
           Checking over his shoulder, he zips his backpack open and
           fills it with CANNED FOOD.

<b>          28 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - DAY 28
</b>
           Hands pump the stock of a high-powered pellet gun.
           TOM BLANKENSHIP(67), white hair cut high and tight wearing a
           short-sleeve button up, takes careful aim with the pellet
           gun.
           Tom sits in a lawn chair atop the roof of his houseboat. He
           squeezes his left eye shut.
           A snake's head pokes out of the water about 15 yards off his
           boat. The head makes for a target no bigger than a thumb.
           Tom's left eye snaps open and he fires. The pellet rips
           through the snake's head. Its body floats to the surface.
           Tom takes account of his shot as he pumps the air rifle. He
           scans the water for more targets.

<b>          29 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 29
</b>
           Ellis watches Tom Blankenship from across the bayou. Tom's
           boat sits directly opposite Ellis', separated by 30 yards of
           muddy brown water.
           Ellis leans against a post under the carport. His backpack
           resting at his feet, he holds the Walkie-Talkie in his hand.
           Senior works behind him washing utensils in the outdoor sink.

<b>                          SENIOR

           Senior doesn't turn around from his work at the sink.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Mr. Blankenship, what do you know
           about him?

<b>                          SENIOR

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I don't know. He looks lonely over
           there.

<b>                          SENIOR
</b>           Some people move to this river to
           work on it, and some move here to
           be left alone.
           Senior makes his way to the ice machine and begins scooping
           ice into a large white cooler.
           Mary Lee emerges from the houseboat dressed for work, a
           secretarial job. Senior stops what he's doing to watch her.
           She walks over to Ellis.

<b>                          MARY LEE

           seven?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Yes ma'am.
           She walks off the boat without a glance in Senior's
           direction. He trails her with his eyes before going back to
           digging in the ice.
          A29 Ellis looks back at Tom. The Walkie SQUAWKS out several A29
           loud BEEPS. Ellis crams it in his backpack and runs off the
           boat.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)

           drag their boat onto the muddy bank.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Where you think he's at?

<b>                          ELLIS

           They head for the treeline.

<b>          31 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 31

           The boys emerge from the woods, their attention focused up to
           the boat hovering in the tree some twenty feet above them.
           Ellis notices the remnants of a fire on the ground. A log
           pushed up next to it for a seat. Ellis kicks at the ash.

<b>                          ELLIS

<b>           MUD (O.S.)

           The boys spin around. They survey the woods but no one's
           there. Their eyes drift up to find Mud sitting in a tree,
           his legs dangle off a branch.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           What're you doin'?
           Mud bounds down, stepping from limb to trunk to the ground.
           It's an agile move.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I try to never sleep in the same
           place twice. What you got there?
           Mud motions with his head to the backpack in Ellis' hand.
           Ellis holds it out to him.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I brought you some food.
           Mud looks at the backpack, but doesn't move.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Go on.

<b>           24.

          Mud takes the backpack and walks over to the ashes of his
          campfire. He squats with his back to the boys and unzips the
          bag. Hunkered down, Mud's shirttail rides up over the lip of
          his jeans revealing a PISTOL at his backside.
          Ellis sees this and motions to Neckbone. The boys stand
          their ground, cautious.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I owe you boys.
          Keeping the bag in hand, Mud takes a seat on the stump behind
          him. He pulls out a selection of canned food; pumpkin pie
          filling, evaporated milk, green beans. He grabs the beans.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           I was gonna try runnin' a trot line
           today. See how far that'd get me.
          Mud removes a good-sized folding knife from his pocket and
          makes short order of the can lid. He tips the can up letting
          the beans fall into his mouth. Juice flows down his cheeks.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)

           had...green bean never tasted so
           good.
          The can is quickly emptied, juice running down Mud's chin.
          He straightens his back, choking down the final swallow. He
          sees the boys staring at him and catches himself.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)

          tree. The boys pivot, keeping Mud in front of them. Mud
          notices.

           the sky. He crosses the makeshift plank to board his house.

<b>           SENIOR (O.S.)
</b>           Home for dinner?
           Ellis is startled by his father's voice. Senior sits in a
           lawn chair under the eaves of the carport. He's hidden in
           shadow, save for a red glow from the tip of his cigarette.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           What you hidin' for?

<b>                          SENIOR
</b>           I ain't hidin'.
           He notices Senior tip back a pint of liquor and set it at his
           feet. Ellis opens the screen door leading inside.

<b>                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Come over here.
           Ellis lets the door fall shut and skulks over to a beam that
           supports the carport. He leans into it.

<b>                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
</b>           You know I love you?

<b>                          ELLIS

           divorce.
          This hits Ellis like a ton of bricks. He rights himself.

<b>                          ELLIS

          Senior takes a slow pull off the bottle. Ellis' mind races.

           Ellis is speechless. After a moment, he turns to go inside.

<b>                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Ellis?
           He stops and turns back to his father. Senior tries to
           express a sentiment he doesn't have the words for. Ellis
           continues inside.

<b>          40 INT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - DEN - CONTINUOUS 40

           Mary Lee sits hunched at the made dinner table. She runs her
           finger around the rim of a half empty glass of iced tea.
           It's a full spread with fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and a
           salad. The table is set for two. She's been waiting.
           Ellis lets the front door slam shut behind him. She sits up.

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           You're late.
           Ellis doesn't speak, he doesn't look at her. He enters his
           room and shuts the door.
           He's heard the news and she knows it. Mary Lee's face drops.

<b>          41 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41
</b>
           Ellis slings his backpack down, pacing the small room. He
           stops and leans his forehead against the door. The sound of
           his Mother clearing the table seeps through.
           He kicks the door, cracking its shitty composite wood. His
           face flushed and his breathing heavy, he slides to a seat.
           On the verge of hyperventilating, he stares out the dark
           bedroom window trying to get control of his breathing.
           Ellis looks at his backpack. It has spilled open revealing a
           can of Beanie Weenie. Ellis studies the can.
           He looks back to the window. His breathing settles.
           Quickly, he scoops up the backpack and heads out the window.

<b>          42 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 42

           It's pitch black. The only light comes from the moon's
           reflection off the surface of the water.
           Ellis, eyes wide, navigates the small boat through choppy
           black water.

<b>          43 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 43

           Ellis struggles to pull the boat onto shore. Leaving it half
           in the water, Ellis looks around. No sign of Mud. He sizes
           up the dark woods.
           He removes a flashlight from his backpack and shines it down
           the shorelines. Still nothing. Ellis follows the beam of
           light into the woods.

<b>          44 EXT. ISLAND WOODS - NIGHT 44
</b>
           Ellis stands at the creek that cuts through the island.
           He can make out a campfire glowing through trees in the
           distance. A RUSTLING behind him. He swings the light
           around. Nothing but trees.
           Ellis takes a deep breath. Finding the log to cross, he
           shines his light down into the creek. The nest of snakes
           show their backs.

<b>          45 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - NIGHT 45
</b>
           A campfire burns at the base of the tree. The firelight
           illuminates the belly of the boat that rests 20 feet above.
           Ellis, his flashlight off, crouches behind a tree and watches
           the campsite. There is no one there. He looks into the
           black forest behind him, thinks of going back.
           A twig snaps in the distance and he's back on guard. Ellis
           nervously scans the woods before finally stepping into the
           light of the campfire.
           The SOUND of a gun's hammer drawing back CLICKS behind him.
           Ellis freezes.
           Mud emerges from the trees, a .45 extended toward Ellis'
           back.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Ellis?
           Ellis, still frozen, slowly turns to him. Mud huffs out a
           laugh and drops the pistol to his side.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)

           Ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I got you some Beanie Weenie.
           Mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the backpack.

           expect you out here at night.
          Mud takes a seat on the log and transfers the cans into his
          own duffel bag. He holds up a can of the Beanie Weenie.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)

           hard to make a meal out of pumpkin
           pie filling.

          Ellis sits as Mud hands him a can. They eat.

          Mud laughs. Finishing the can, he takes a half-smoked
          cigarette from his shirt pocket. He pulls a twig from the
          fire for a light.

           was like the world split open, came

          smiles at the boy. The hole from his missing tooth shows.

           Ellis smiles.
           They sit in silence. Ellis stares up at the boat hanging
           over them, its peeling hull lit by the firelight.
           Mud pinches the ash from the end of his cigarette, places the
           stub back in his shirt pocket. Noticing Ellis, Mud tilts his
           head back to take in the boat.

</b>           What do you wanna talk about? You
           want to leave and that means they
           can tear up our house.

          Mary Lee is interrupted by a line of traffic backed up in
          front of her. She slows to a stop.

<b>           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
</b>           Oh no. I hope no one's hurt.
          There are flashing police lights up ahead. Ellis tries to
          see what's going on but can't make anything out past the line
          of cars. They inch forward.

<b>           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm just saying there are two sides
           to this. I haven't made up my mind
           about anything because I want you
           to be involved in my decision, but
           I need a change Ellis. I deserve
           one.
          As they approach the flashing lights, they see three State
          Trooper vehicles parked to funnel traffic down to one lane.
          The STATE TROOPERS stop each car, checking the trunks.

<b>           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
</b>           I think they're searching people.
          A Trooper signals Mary Lee to pull up to a stop. Two other
          Troopers approach her vehicle. The first begins looking in
          her back windows as the second leans down to speak to her.
          She lowers her window.

<b>                          TROOPER
</b>           Can you open the trunk please
           ma'am?

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           Of course.

<b>           41.
</b>
                         
          Mary Lee pulls the lever by her knee, and the second Trooper
          walks around the back of the car.

<b>                          TROOPER
</b>           Have you picked up or seen any
           hitchhikers today ma'am?

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           No sir.
          The Trooper produces a flier with a color photo on it.

<b>                          TROOPER
</b>           Have you seen this man?

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           No sir.
          The Trooper leans over and holds the paper out to Ellis.

<b>                          TROOPER
</b>           Son, have you seen this man?
          Ellis looks at the photo. It's of Mud. He looks exactly the
          same as he did last night, down to the shirt. In the photo,
          Mud's smiling, revealing his missing tooth.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           No.

<b>                          TROOPER

           immediately.

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           We will officer.
          The Trooper pulls his head from the window.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           What'd he do?!
          The Trooper bends back down and looks at Ellis.

<b>                          TROOPER

          Mary Lee pulls forward and speeds back up on the interstate.

           Ellis busts through the door, grabs his backpack and is gone.

<b>          49 EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 49
</b>
           Ellis is off the houseboat and running up the bank.
           He heads down the dirt path, grabbing the Walkie Talkie out
           of his backpack.

</b>
           Ellis removes branches and readies the flat bottom boat to
           launch. The sound of Neckbone's bike arrives before he does.
           Neckbone crests the sand covered slope. He dismounts and
           starts to chain the bike up to a tree trunk.

<b>                          NECKBONE

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           My mom and I were headed to Wal-
           Mart on 165. There was a roadblock
           with state troopers. They searched
           our car and showed us a picture of
           Mud. They're lookin' for him.

</b>           No. That's why I called you. We
           gotta warn him.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           He's goin' to get Juniper today. I
           went out there last night and told
           him where we saw her. He needs to
           know people are lookin' for him.

           already? Jesus Ellis, why do you
           think he's on that island? You
           don't even know what he's wanted
           for.
           Ellis climbs in the boat and Neckbone yanks his shoulder.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           Ellis! I'm serious. We don't know

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           He loves her Neck. He told me.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           I don't give a shit who he loves.
           Ellis starts the motor and waits for his friend.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           He's not dangerous.
           Reluctantly, Neckbone throws his leg into the boat.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           It sounds like a shitload of state

           Ellis and Neckbone emerge from the woods at Mud's campsite.
           They scan nearby tree limbs.

<b>           MUD (O.S.)
</b>           Hey!
           The boys look straight up. Mud leans over the edge of the
           boat above them.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           Up here!
           Mud drops them a rope with knots tied in it. Ellis starts
           inching his way up. Neckbone begrudgingly follows.

<b>          52 EXT. BOAT IN TREE - CONTINUOUS 52
</b>
           Ellis pulls himself over the edge of the boat. He finds Mud
           sitting in the swivel chair behind the steering wheel. He
           writes in an open spiral notebook with a black Sharpie.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           What are you doin'?

</b>           I'm gonna have to go back on our

           good about it, but I don't see any
           other way outta what I'm into.
           Neckbone makes his way on board. Mud has pulled a panel off
           the steering column. Exposed wires dangle.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           So you know about the state
           troopers?
           He looks up from his notebook.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           What state troopers?

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           The ones spreadin' your picture all
           over the place. Stoppin' cars on
           165 searchin' for your ass.
           Mud factors this in and then goes back to writing.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I didn't know about that, but it
           doesn't surprise me. There plenty
           of folks lookin' for me right now.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Why?

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I shot a man. Killed him.

<b>           45.

          Mud stands and walks to the back of the boat. The boys' eyes
          follow him cautiously.
          Mud lifts a hatch at the back that would typically house the
          batteries and engine wiring. There's nothing left but a hole
          into the trees. He makes a note.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm sorry I didn't tell ya'll
           sooner, but I was hopin' to be gone
           before anything came of it. Didn't
           want you involved.
          Mud turns to really face them for the first time.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           Ya'll have been real good to me.
           You're the only friends I got out
           here. If the state troopers have
           165 blocked, they'll have others
           blocked too. I won't get anywhere
           in a car. I want to try takin'
           this boat down, see if we can get
           it in the water.
          Ellis and Neckbone stand their ground. They don't say
          anything. Mud walks back to the steering column. He drops to
          his knees and fiddles with the wires.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           With a boat like this I can make it
           to the gulf in two days. I could
           get anywhere from there. But I'd
           need a boat at least this big to
           make it on open water. It's got no
           title, no owner, nobody lookin' for
           it. It's my best shot.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I need to hear about it.
          Mud sits up. He looks at Ellis, deciding how much to tell.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Juniper made a mistake. She hooked
           up with a guy. He was no good.
           His name was Hutchins. Family owns
           a chain of restaurants down in
           Texas.

<b>           46.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Where were you?

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I was around, but me and Juniper
           were on the outs. She met this
           Hutchins, he sold her on some lies.
           Got her pregnant. That's when he
           started showin' who he really was.
           He dropped June down a flight of
           stairs after whoopin' her half to
           death. She lost the baby. He made
           it so the doctors think she can't
           have children anymore. There're
           things you can get away with in
           this world and things you can't. I
           tracked him down at a motel just
           outside of San Antonio. He was
           there with another woman. That's
           where it happened.
          Mud's done with his story. He goes back to the wiring.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           I understand if you can't help me
           anymore, but I need this boat. And
           I need to get it in the water fast.
          After a moment, he sits up and wipes sweat from his forehead.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           I've made a list. Things we'll
           need. What do ya'll think?
          Ellis takes time to consider everything. He looks at
          Neckbone, who has a disgruntled look on his face.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           You did it for her? To protect
           her?

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Yeah.
          Ellis nods. Mud looks over at Neckbone, who still has the
          disgruntled look on his face.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           What do you think?

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           I think you want us to run around,
           stickin' our necks out, gettin'
           everything you need, just so you
           can take our boat.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           That's about it.
          Mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What do we get out of it?

<b>                          MUD
</b>           What do you want?
          Neckbone looks to Ellis, judging his bargaining position.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What about that pistol?
          Mud eyes the boy, pulling on the nub of cigarette.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I only got two things out here
           worth anything. This shirt...
          Mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans. Neckbone
          tenses, but relaxes when Mud splays it out on an open palm.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           And this pistol. I can't give you
           the shirt `cause I need it for
           protection, but if you help me get
           this boat in the water, the
           pistol's yours.
          Neckbone squinches his face in thought, sizing up this trade.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What kind is it?

<b>                          MUD

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           I guess we could work a deal like
           that.
          Neckbone steps forward to grab the pistol, but Mud puts it
          back in his jeans.

<b>                          MUD

</b>           All right then.

<b>           48.

           Mud smiles, flashing his missing tooth. He spits in his palm
           and holds it out to Neckbone. Neckbone, not sure about
           taking the spit hand, reluctantly shakes.
           Mud rips a page from the notebook and hands it to Ellis.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Ya'll scrounge what you can off
           this list, but if we're gonna get
           this done right we'll need more
           help. Can you fetch Tom for me?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Tom Blankenship?
           Mud has smoked down to the filter. He crushes the butt into
           his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I was hopin' to let that old
           assassin stay put, but we'll need
           him to get things ya'll can't. Can
           you find him?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I know where he lives, but I've
           never spoke to him.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Just tell him my name. He'll know
           you're serious.
           Ellis folds the list up. He and Neckbone start down the rope
           as Mud goes back to the wiring.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           Boys?

<b>                          (THEY PAUSE)
</b>           Thanks.
           Ellis nods.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Don't lose my pistol.
           They continue down the rope. Mud continues his work.

<b>          53 EXT. SHELLY'S OXBOW - DAY 53
</b>
           Ellis steers to the southern mouth of Shelly's Oxbow, the
           bend in the river that holds he and Tom Blankenship's
           houseboats, among others.
           He grounds the boat just shy of entering the Oxbow and steps
           over Neckbone to hop onto the bank.

<b>           49.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           I'll watch the boat.
           Ellis scans the woods that populate the patch of land wedged
           between the river and this short tributary.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           Ellis?

<b>                          ELLIS

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Be careful. Galen always said that
           old man's crazy.
           Neckbone keeps his seat as Ellis darts into the woods

<b>          54 EXT. TOM'S WOODS - DAY 54
</b>
           Ellis prowls around the small pine trees and bushes. He
           pauses, seeing the entrance to Tom Blankenship's boat.
           Something moves on the houseboat. Ellis hunkers down behind
           a bush. He sees Tom wrapping cable onto a metal spool.
           Ellis is nervous. He checks over his shoulder, nothing but
           woods. When he looks back to the boat, Tom is gone. In a
           crouch, Ellis moves closer.
           Taking a deep breath, Ellis steps out from the cover of the
           pine trees and heads up a walkway that leads onboard.

<b>           TOM (O.S.)
</b>           Why you huntin' me?
           Ellis flinches. He turns to find Tom Blankenship standing at
           the edge of the boat.

<b>                          TOM (CONT'D)

<b>                          ELLIS

</b>           What you got to say he can't tell
           me himself?
           Tom, rusty on pleasantries, brushes past Ellis as he heads
           inside the boat.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           It ain't from him.
           Ellis, not wanting to follow further, shouts from the planks.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           MUD SENT ME!
</b>           There is a silence. Then footsteps. Tom reappears.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           He asked me to come get you.
           Tom straightens his back. He looks into the woods, searching
           for something he may have missed.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           Your daddy know this?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           No sir. Mud needs your help.
           Tom's mind churns on a series of facts unknown to the boy.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           Where is he?

<b>          55 EXT. RIVER - DAY 55
</b>
           Neckbone bounces in the boat as it shifts in the choppy
           Mississippi water. His eyes are locked on the back of Tom's
           head. Tom rides stone faced in the front.
           Neckbone turns back to Ellis and raises his eyebrows as if to
           ask, "What's going on?". Ellis shrugs.

<b>           51.
</b>
                         

<b>          56 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 56
</b>
           Ellis runs the boat on shore. Tom splashes into the ankle
           deep water and helps the boys drag it onto the bank.
           Ellis takes the lead, walking ahead and scanning the
           treeline. Mud steps out, just past the shadow of the woods.
           Ellis turns to Tom and points.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           There he is.
           Tom spits onto the muddy bank and makes his way toward Mud.
           Ellis and Neckbone stay by the boat and watch.

<b>           BY THE TREELINE,
</b>           Mud watches Tom approaching. He corrects his posture and
           feebly attempts to smooth some wrinkles from his shirt.
           Tom stops in front of him, his eyes pinched in the sun.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           Mud.

<b>                          MUD

           They stare at each other for a long moment. Neither one
           flinching.

<b>           BY THE BOAT,
</b>           At this distance, the boys can't hear what is being said, but
           they try and size up the situation through body language.

<b>                          NECKBONE

           Tom lowers his head. Frustrated.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           Why you out here like this?

<b>           BY THE BOAT,
</b>
<b>           52.
</b>
                         
          The boys see Mud take a seat on a nearby stump. He's
          explaining something. Tom listens, standing over him.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           They don't look like family.
          Ellis watches Mud as he gestures and speaks. He seems
          different. Younger.
          Mud stops talking. Tom scratches a hand through his white
          crew cut. He begins pointing a finger at Mud. His face is
          flushed and the sound of his voice carries to the boys,
          though still unintelligible.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           He's really givin' it to him.

<b>          AT THE TREELINE,

           on an island beggin' for help. A

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I ain't no thief.

<b>                          TOM

           even mention draggin' those boys
           into this. Do you have any idea
           what you're doin'?
          Waits for a response, but Mud gives none.

<b>                          TOM (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm ashamed of you.
          Mud looks up at him.

<b>                          TOM (CONT'D)
</b>           Don't expect help from me. There's
           none to be given.

<b>          AT THE BOAT,
</b>          They see Tom turn his back on Mud and head toward the boat.
          Mud doesn't protest; he doesn't move.
          Tom brushes past Ellis.

<b>           53.

<b>                          TOM (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm ready.
          Tom shoves the boat back into the water. Neckbone helps him.
          Ellis looks back at Mud, who still hasn't moved from his
          stump. He goes to him. Tom sees this and stops pushing.

<b>                          TOM (CONT'D)

<b>          AT THE TREELINE,

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           You all right?
          Mud raises his head.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Looks like we're on our own.
          He stands and takes a folded piece of paper from his shirt.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           I didn't want you bein' the one to
           do this, but I can't see a way
           around it. I need to get this
           letter to Juniper. Could you take
           it to her for me?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                          MUD

           yourself.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I can handle it.
          Ellis steps forward and Mud hands over the note. Ellis takes
          it and walks back to the others.

<b>          AT THE BOAT,
</b>          Tom stares at Ellis as he climbs on board.
          Tom looks back at Mud, who is watching him. He gives the
          boat a final shove before pulling himself in. They motor
          away. Tom doesn't look back.

           livin' in the woods when I met him.
           Younger than you are now.
           Tom doesn't offer anymore. Neckbone thinks on his answer.
           Ellis kills the engine near the mouth of Shelly's Oxbow. Tom
           jumps down into the knee deep river and wades onto shore. He
           turns back to the boys.

<b>                          TOM (CONT'D)

           part of. I suggest you forget
           about him.
           Ellis and Neckbone don't respond. Tom, with a final
           admonishing look, disappears into the woods.
           Ellis cranks the motor and points the boat up river.

<b>          58 EXT. RIVER - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER 58

           Edges of the notebook paper flap in the wind. Neckbone reads
           Mud's letter to Juniper.
           Ellis reaches the bank where they stash their boat. He shuts
           off the motor and let's them drift. Neckbone folds the
           letter back up and turns to face Ellis.

           Neckbone rides with Ellis on the back of his dirt bike.
           Cars and Trucks HONK and zip by them. Their speed is topped
           out at about 15 miles per hour. Mostly a result of the small
           3X4 metal trailer they are towing behind the bike.
           One of Senior's white fish coolers sits in the trailer.

<b>          60 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN/PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON 60

           Parked in the far corner of the lot, Ellis sits on top of the
           white cooler eyeing the Executive Inn. Neckbone straddles
           the dirt bike. A handful of cars are parked at the motel; an
           old Honda, a pick-up, and a BLACK LINCOLN.

<b>                          ELLIS

           They each grab an end of the cooler and carry it across the
           lot toward a flight of stairs.

<b>          61 ON THE SECOND FLOOR, 61
</b>           The boys set the cooler down in front of the first room on
           the corner. Ellis checks over his shoulder, nothing strange.
           Ellis knocks. They wait. No answer.
           They pick the cooler up and walk to the next door. Knock.
           After a moment, a BLACK MAN in his late sixties opens the
           door wearing boxers and an undershirt.

<b>                          BLACK MAN

           He slams the door.
           They drag the cooler to the next door. As Ellis holds up his
           fist to knock, they hear a woman shouting a few doors down.

<b>           JUNIPER (O.S.)

<b>           STOP IT! STOP!
</b>           Ellis heads for the room. Neckbone drags the cooler after
           him. Ellis reaches the motel room door, which has been left
           ajar. He places his hand on it and lets it fall open.

<b>           CRACK YOUR NOSE OPEN!
</b>           The door opens to CARVER(47), a tall, slender man in a dark
           Western cut suit, standing over Juniper. She's crumpled up
           in a ball at the end of the bed. Carver swats open-handed at
           her head. Grabs the top of her hair.

<b>                          CARVER (CONT'D)

           lie.
           Ellis rushes Carver with his shoulder as if he were breaking
           down a door. Carver is knocked off balance. He trips over
           the edge of the bed and crashes into the motel room wall.
           Carver, slightly stunned, gets to his feet and in two broad
           steps lands a man-sized punch across Ellis' face. It's hard.
           Ellis melts. He grabs the boy up by the scruff of his shirt.

<b>                          CARVER (CONT'D)
</b>           Who are you!? Who the hell are
           you!? Did he send you!?
           Carver removes a piece of paper from his pocket. It's a
           photo copied picture of Mud, different than the State
           Trooper's. Carver crams the photo in the boy's face.

<b>                          CARVER (CONT'D)

           Do you know him!?
           Blood trickles from a cut under Ellis' eye. He stutters
           under the shaking force of Carver's hands.

          Neckbone is yelling at the top of his lungs, almost in a
          girl's pitch. Carver turns to him. The cooler is open
          behind them and Neckbone holds up two Ziplock bags of fish.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>           We're just selling fish!
          Carver sizes things up. It takes a moment, but he settles.
          He snorts out a laugh and drops Ellis on the ground.
          Carver turns his attention back to Juniper, who is huddled up
          in the corner of the motel. Carver walks over to her.
          Opening a good-sized knife, he gets down in her face and
          holds the blade uncomfortably close to her cheek.

<b>                          CARVER
</b>           I know you know where he is. And I
           swear to God I'll cut through every
           one a you to find him.
          She flinches. Standing, Carver folds up his knife.

<b>                          CARVER (CONT'D)
</b>           We know you came here for him, and
           we know he's too stupid to leave

           head out of whatever shithole he's
           staying in, I'll be there. You

          Carver turns, stepping over Ellis on his way out.

<b>                          CARVER (CONT'D)
</b>           And you need to mind your business
           boy.
          Neckbone moves from the doorway to let him pass. Carver is
          gone. Neckbone shuts the door and fastens the security
          latch. He kneels down to check on his friend.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           You all right?

<b>                          ELLIS

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           He popped your eye.
          Ellis holds the back of his hand up to his eye which has
          begun to swell. The cut trickles blood over his cheekbone.
          Juniper moves to the sink. Ellis sits up, staring at her
          back.

<b>           58.

          She opens an ice bucket and wraps a handful of cubes in a
          towel. She turns and walks over to them, her eyes cast down.
          She kneels in front of Ellis, making eye contact for the
          first time. She touches his chin, gently pivoting it to see
          the wound. Her eyes are glassy.

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           Thank you.
          He stares back at her. He can't take his eyes off her. She
          holds the iced towel to his cheek. He doesn't even flinch.

<b>                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm so sorry.
          Tears form and run down her cheeks.

<b>                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Here.
          She takes his hand and places it against the towel. She gets
          to her feet and pulls a pocket book from a bag in the corner.

<b>                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
</b>           How much is your fish? I'll buy
           the cooler full.
          Ellis motions Neckbone to the cooler. Neckbone goes over and
          crams his hand into the ice. He removes a Ziplock bag
          containing the note that Mud sent.
          Neckbone hands it to Ellis. Taking the note, he sets his ice
          down and walks over to Juniper.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Mud sent us to give this to you.
          Juniper is stunned. She looks at the bag, then at the boys.

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           You've met Mud?
          Ellis nods. Neckbone speaks up from the back.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Yeah we met him.
          Juniper takes the bag. She removes the letter and takes a
          seat on the edge of the bed to read it.
          Ellis watches her eyes move along the paper. She smiles,
          which makes Ellis smile. After a moment, she folds it up.

<b>                          JUNIPER

          Juniper raises her eyebrows at Neckbone.

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           Well do you know how long `hold

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           God.
          Juniper shakes her head and goes to the sink. She pulls a
          lighter from her jeans pocket and torches Mud's note.

<b>                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)

          Running water over the ashes, she turns back to them.

</b>           But I don't want ya'll involved.

</b>           What do you call that?
          She motions to his swelling eye. Ellis shrugs.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           We'll be all right. Keep your door
           locked. We'll be in touch.
          Ellis heads to the door as Neckbone gathers up the cooler.

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           Wait.
          Ellis turns back.

           Juniper walks up to Ellis and puts her hands on his
           shoulders. She has to bend slightly to do it, but she kisses
           him just above his swollen eye.

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           Thank you Ellis.
           Ellis stares at her, infatuated.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           We gotta go.
           Ellis turns and grabs one end of the cooler. Neckbone slaps
           back the security latch and opens the door with his free
           hand. They walk out.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Lock the door.
           She smiles. The door slams shut. The room number, 212,
           stares Ellis in the face. He takes a deep breath.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Let's go hard on.
           He and Ellis wrangle the cooler down the steps. The sun set
           while they were inside. A blue hue hangs over everything.

           wheel of his black Lincoln town car, conscious to blow any
           smoke out the open driver's window.
           His car, wedged between two others in the Piggly Wiggly
           parking lot, is pointed toward the Executive Inn. He watches
           as Ellis and Neckbone load the cooler onto Neckbone's bike.

           Ellis enters his houseboat. It's quiet.
           He sees a note on the counter next to a can of soup. It
           reads, "I've gone to a movie. Warm up some soup for dinner.
           Love, Mom". Ellis picks up the can, not thrilled.
           He goes to the fridge and grabs a sack of peas from the
           freezer. Holding the peas against his eye he takes a seat at
           the counter and flips through a phone book.
           He finds what he needs and dials a corded phone. He waits.

           they're all right...Tomorrow? Yeah,

           Ellis hangs up the phone. With the peas pressed firmly
           against his face, he smirks.

           -Inside a decrepit wooden shack, Ellis gives Neckbone a look
           like he's a dumbass as they proceed to take the shack apart
           board by board. Ellis now has a full-on BLACK EYE.
          A66 -Neckbone stands lookout under the carport section of Ellis' A66
           houseboat. The coast clear, he gives Ellis a nod. Ellis
           pops open a metal locker and removes a small chainsaw and
           container of gas. He loads these into an empty fish cooler.
          B66 -Tom, sitting atop his houseboat with his pellet gun, watchesB66

          C66 -At Neckbone's mobile home park, Ellis heaves loops of thick C66
           rope onto their mini dirt bike trailer. Neckbone stands
           nearby laughing with the rope's OWNER, a lanky guy with brown
           teeth and a Tasmanian Devil tattoo on his neck.
          AC66 -Ellis hoists Neckbone up by the foot allowing him to AC66
           unscrew a road sign.
          D66 -A mop soaked in black tar slops across the flat roof of the D66
           furniture store in downtown Dewitt. Neckbone and Ellis stand
           in the store's parking lot yelling up to the ROOFERS.
           -They get one's attention, and Neckbone points to a dried
           pile of leftover tar that has been dumped at the back of the
           building. The ROOFER swats a hand at the boys. They proceed
           to load the dried hunk onto the small trailer.
          E66 -From a distance, Neckbone and Ellis stand on a sailboat in E66
           the middle of a fenced-in marine junkyard. Surrounded by old
           boat parts, the boys begin shuttling several large metal

           Mud stands with Ellis and Neckbone on the deck of the boat.
           He holds a pulley in one hand and a length of rope in the
           other. He stares up into the trees.

<b>           64.
</b>
                         

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Ellis, can you climb up that trunk
           and get these hung?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Take a foot of line and tie `em off
           with a bowline knot. You know it?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I'm not stupid.
          Ellis takes the pulley and scales the trunk without
          hesitation. Mud tosses his pocket knife to Neckbone.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Neck, start cuttin' line. Three
           fifteen foot sections. Count a
           foot long as your arm.
          Mud begins threading the pulleys with rope. As Neckbone cuts
          rope, he sees the pistol stuck in the back of Mud's pants.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           What's so special `bout that shirt
           you'd lose your pistol for it?

<b>                          MUD
</b>           It's got a wolf's eye sewn in the
           sleeve. More protection than a
           bullet ever gave. Tom swears by
           it.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           He said he wasn't your daddy.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Tom's the closest thing I ever knew
           to a father.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           I never met my parents.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           It's hard not knowin' the ones you
           came from.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           My uncle Galen tells me things
           about `em. He's the one that takes
           care of me.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Tom did that for me.

<b>           65.
</b>
                         
           Ellis drops down to the deck and grabs another pulley.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           What'd you mean when you called Tom
           an assassin?

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Tom's had lives you'd never know
           about. Grew up up North. Went to
           Yale. For a long time he was a
           paid killer for the C.I.A. Lived
           in Cuba in `63. He's probably
           killed more people than you've met.

<b>                          (TO NECKBONE)
</b>           Hand me that line.
           Neckbone tosses him an end of rope, looks to Ellis. Ellis
           gives a shrug before heading back up the trunk.

<b>          70 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY - LATER 70
</b>
           Mud hangs off the tree fifteen feet up by a piece of rope
           tied around his waist. A series of ropes and pulleys
           crisscross from the boat to the trees.
           Neckbone and Ellis stand on the ground staring up at him.
           Mud holds a chainsaw and seems to be hesitating.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Well if you're gonna do it do it!
           Mud takes a deep breath and yanks the cord. Angled on one of
           the main branches holding up the boat, Mud begins cutting.
           Ellis and Neckbone step further and further back as they
           watch the chainsaw work through the thick limb.
           Suddenly, the chainsaw stops. A deep CRACKING sound. The
           huge branch SNAPS, tumbling off lower limbs before crashing
           to the ground. Mud holds onto the trunk for dear life.
           The branch now rests on the ground, SILENCE. The ropes and
           pulleys hang taught, squeaking from the weight of the boat.
           Mud slowly lifts his head up. He smiles at what he sees.
           The rigging has held.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           One down!
           Neckbone and Ellis watch as Mud scampers around the trunk to
           the next branch. The chainsaw cranks back on.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           This shit is crazy.

<b>           66.

<b>          71 I/E. MARY LEE'S CAR/PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - LATE 71
</b>
<b>                          AFTERNOON
</b>           Ellis looks out the car window at HIGH SCHOOL KIDS that have
           gathered in the Piggly Wiggly parking lot. His hair is
           slicked to one side, and he's wearing a collared shirt.

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           You look nice.

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           What time are you gonna be home?
           Ellis shrugs. She looks at him as the car radio rambles.

<b>           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
</b>           No later than eleven?
           Ellis nods.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           You make up your mind?

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           About moving in town?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           About leavin' dad.
           Mary Lee thinks about how to answer, shuts off the radio.

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           You can't make other people change
           Ellis. If I'm unhappy then I'll
           have to be the one to change
           something.
           Ellis chews on the inside of his cheek and watches her avoid
           eye contact. He shoulders his way out of the car.
           Mary Lee takes a moment before driving off.
           As Mary Lee pulls away, Ellis takes in the scene.

<b>          72 EXT. EXECUTIVE INN - LATE AFTERNOON - ELLIS POV 72
</b>
           He looks up at Juniper's motel room and sees her leaning on
           the railing smoking a cigarette. She doesn't see him.

<b>          73 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS 73
</b>
           He pauses, noticing a MAN to his left who ALSO stares up at
           Juniper. The man, early thirties with a thick mustache, is
           JAMES. He leans against the grill of a black Lincoln.

<b>           67.
</b>
                         
           Carver appears from inside the Piggly Wiggly. He holds a cup
           of coffee and is closely trailed by a fat little man,
           NELSON(56). They're all dressed in a similar fashion, a
           cross between rural farmers and rodeo stars.
           As Carver approaches the Lincoln, he scolds James for leaning
           on the grill. Carver rubs the hood with his coat sleeve and
           gives orders to the men.

<b>           MAY PEARL (O.S.)
</b>           Ellis!
           Ellis turns to see May Pearl hopping down from a Ford Bronco.
           She leans on the door and waves Ellis into the back.

<b>           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
</b>           Come on!
           Ellis takes another look at Carver and his men before running
           over to the Bronco.

<b>          74 EXT. FIELD/BONFIRE - NIGHT 74
</b>
           A bonfire rages in the middle of an open field. A FEW DOZEN
           KIDS mingle between vehicles and the fire. Drinking,
           yelling, music blasting from car speakers.
           Ellis stands by himself next to the blaze with his hands in
           his pockets. May Pearl has vanished.
           Pryor, the skinny kid Ellis punched to get this date, wanders
           past. He makes eye contact. Ellis stares him down. Pryor
           glares back but then just skulks over to another group.

<b>           MAY PEARL (O.S.)
</b>           Try this.
           A Styrofoam Sonic Cup is thrust into Ellis' hand. He turns
           to find May Pearl standing next to him.

<b>           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
</b>           Come on.
           She leads Ellis behind one of the trucks parked nearby. May
           Pearl climbs onto the tailgate, a red glow across her face.
           No one else is around. Ellis hesitates.

<b>           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
</b>           You wanna sit down?
           Ellis takes a seat next to her. She looks at him, smiling,
           and gestures to his black eye.

<b>           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)
</b>           You must really like to fight?

<b>           68.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Not really.
          Ellis takes a sip from the Sonic cup. His face puckers.

<b>                          MAY PEARL
</b>           But you're not scared if you have
           to.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I guess. You got a lot of friends.

<b>                          MAY PEARL
</b>           They're all right. I don't know
           all of `em.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I bet you're pretty popular.

<b>                          MAY PEARL
</b>           Why do you say that?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I don't know. `Cause you're nice
           to people.

<b>                          MAY PEARL

<b>                          ELLIS

<b>                          MAY PEARL
</b>           But I like you.
          Ellis digs into his jeans pocket.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I got this for you.
          He removes a bracelet made from the pearls he collected off
          Galen's porch. May Pearl takes it, begins putting it on.

<b>                          MAY PEARL
</b>           A bracelet?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Neckbone's uncle caught the pearls.
           I thought with your name and
           everything...

<b>                          MAY PEARL
</b>           Thank you.
          She leans over, hugging him with a kiss on the cheek. She
          stays close.

           She smiles, then kisses him.

<b>          75 EXT. ELLIS' AND TOM'S HOUSEBOATS - MORNING 75
</b>
           Morning fog sits on top of the water around Ellis' houseboat.
           Ellis steps outside and makes his way to the ice machine. A
           loud WHISTLE comes from across the oxbow. Ellis walks to the
           edge of the garage.
          A75 He sees Tom Blankenship seated on the roof of his houseboat. A75
           He motions Ellis over.
           Ellis watches him, unsure of what to do. Another WHISTLE.
           Tom motions to him again. Ellis looks back at the house. No
           sign of his parents. He shoots a glance back at Tom.

<b>          76 EXT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - MOMENTS LATER 76
</b>
           Ellis bumps his father's boat against the side of Tom's
           houseboat. He steps up onto the deck and ties off.
           Tom, down from the roof, stands by his front door.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           You want some coffee?
           Tom disappears inside.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I don't drink coffee.
           Ellis waits for a moment, but realizes this is Tom's way of
           inviting him inside. He enters.

<b>          77 INT. TOM BLANKENSHIP'S HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 77
</b>
           This houseboat, although similar in size, is different than
           Ellis'. It's an actual wood shack that has been constructed
           atop a barge.
           Ellis looks at photos, books and memorabilia that cram the
           walls and shelves. It feels homey.
           Tom, his back to the boy, stands in the kitchen area pouring
           a cup of coffee.

<b>                          TOM

<b>           70.

          A collection of framed photos on a desk catches Ellis'
          attention. A young Tom with a pretty dark skinned girl.
          They seem happy. Another photo, late 60's, of Tom standing
          alone in a suit. He holds a LONG SUITCASE.
          Tom enters holding two cups of coffee.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           You don't have to lie to me boy.
          He hands Ellis a cup of coffee with a cartoon image of a dog
          on it. It reads, "I'm a real bitch in the morning!" Tom
          sits in a LazyBoy that he gently rocks in.

<b>                          TOM (CONT'D)

</b>           He called you an assassin.
          Tom snorts out a laugh, sips his coffee.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Because he hurt Juniper.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           Right. The real reason Mud's in
           the trouble he's got is because of
           her. He's been in love with that
           girl since he was your age. They
           used to run all around here and it
           was the same back then. He'd
           follow that girl wherever she led
           him. Problem is she don't care
           about nobody but herself. I've
           told him as much. She'd bed down
           with the meanest snake she could
           find, then when things went bad
           she'd go runnin' to Mud. Mud would
           take her back, then go find
           whatever unlucky sonofabitch last
           put a hand on her and beat `em `til
           they knew to never touch her again.
           And this time I guess he thought a
           beating wasn't good enough. Had to
           shoot that fella. I don't know for
           sure, but I'd put money on Juniper
           knowin' he'd do it. And I have a

          Ellis can't look Tom in the eye, he's offended by the old
          man's remarks. Ellis sets the coffee cup on the desk.

           Tom eyes the boy, taking a sip from his cup. He nods a
           goodbye to Ellis who is already out the door.

</b>
           Ellis stomps out of the trees and is struck by the new
           position of the boat. It hangs three feet off the ground;
           SUSPENDED in dry dock. A clear-cut path of trees leads off
           toward the island's southern shore.
           Beside the boat, remnants of a giant fire smolder. Ellis
           surveys the MOUND OF ASH.

<b>           MUD (O.S.)
</b>           What you say Ellis?
           Ellis turns to find Mud standing on the deck of the boat
           holding a fistful of wires. He jumps down.

<b>                          ELLIS

<b>          80 EXT. UNDERWATER - RIVER - DAY 80
</b>
           Fully suited in diving gear, Galen toils in the murky brown
           water at the bottom of the river.
           His gear consists of a typical wet-suit, wet-socks but no
           gloves. His metal helmet is not typical. It's welded from
           half a hot water heater that's been fitted with barbell
           weights. A hose connected to the top runs to the surface.
           Galen ties off a netted sack and yanks on its line.

<b>          81 EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS 81
</b>
           A small air compressor chugs as Neckbone stands in the middle
           of Galen's boat pulling in the heavy rope. At the end, the
           net bulging with mussel shells appears.
           He manages to roll the heavy load into the boat before moving
           over to a crank handle that feeds another line.
           After several cranks, Galen's steel helmet breaches the
           surface. He places his hands on the edge of the boat as
           Neckbone removes the barbell weights.
           The weight removed, Neckbone takes off the helmet. Galen
           pulls himself into the boat, out of breath.

<b>                          GALEN

</b>           I've had worse.
           Galen reclines as Neckbone kills the air compressor and
           begins organizing the gear. He watches his little nephew.

           Ellis pops open the tailgate and reaches for a cooler.
           The Catfish Parlour is one business in a strip center row.
           There is nothing else around save for farmland and a motel
           across the road.
           Ellis notices Carver's black LINCOLN parked in the motel lot.
           He walks away from the truck to get a better look.
           Ellis scans the FOUR OTHER VEHICLES in the lot. All Texas
           plates. A maroon Cadillac sails past and turns into the
           motel. Ellis recedes to the rear of his truck.
           He watches as KING(76), a fireplug of a man, emerges from the
           Cadillac. Cramped from a long drive, he stretches and eyes
           the sign for the Pines Motel.
           A motel room door opens and Carver walks out. He's smiling
           and calls out to King. They hug as a green PICK-UP pulls up.
           MILLER, a slick dressed man in black boots, climbs out.

           looks back over his shoulder for a final glance at the men.

           An episode of the Smurfs plays on the television. There's a
           MAN on each of the queen beds. Another THREE playing cards
           at a small table by the window. MILLER stands in the corner
           smoking. Empty Budweiser cans litter the room.
           King, unimpressed by the scene, looks at his son. Carver

</b>           Jesus!
           They squint and shield their eyes.
           The light shuts off as quickly as it came on. Galen stands
           in front of them wearing his wet suit. The bar with the
           flood lights attached sits across his shoulders.
           The boys rub their eyeballs, seeing spots. Galen shuffles
           over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the
           lights. He labors to take a seat.

          Neckbone, still blinking, goes back to his room. Ellis
          notices Galen staring at him. Galen pats the couch.

<b>                          GALEN
</b>           Come `ere Ellis.
          Ellis takes a seat on the other end of the couch. Galen pats
          the spot next to him. Ellis scoots over, uncomfortable.

          as Galen begins to remove his light rig.

           a small amp in the corner.

           A BOAT TRAILER rests atop FOUR, 55-GALLON BRIGHT YELLOW
           BARRELS affixed with plastic zip ties. The make-shift raft
           is half on shore with the back still floating in the water.
           The boys watch as Mud walks around the trailer cutting off
           the zip ties. The barrels kick out from underneath the

          Mud moves to the front of the boat trailer and begins
          dragging it fully onto the bank. It's heavy.

           Ellis looks at Juniper's motel. He scans the Piggly Wiggly
           parking lot and spots Carver's black Lincoln. Ellis picks up
           the phone and deposits some change. He dials.

<b>           INSIDE THE JUNKYARD,
</b>           Ellis and Neckbone creep through piles of starboard and boat
           parts. They stop at a party barge with only one pontoon. At
           its rear hangs a big rusted motor, 200 horsepower.
           Neckbone quickly disassembles its attachment. The motor pops
           loose leaving the boys to strain against its heavy weight.
           They ease it to the ground.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Jesus that's heavy.
           The boys get on either side of the motor and begin half-

           sitting on the water's edge of the boat. He goes over to it.
           He opens the sack and takes a quick inventory. A loaf of
           bread, potted meats, a bottle of Jack Daniels, a roll of
           cash, and an Arkansas boat tag.
           Ellis looks around, no one. He looks over to Tom's boat.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Take your bike around the side.
           I'll check her room. We'll just
           have to hope no one sees us.
           Neckbone cranks the bike and speeds toward the motel. Ellis
           looks to the motel, then the parking lot.

<b>           ON THE SECOND FLOOR,
</b>           Ellis cautiously heads up the stairs. He eyes the parking
           lot at the Piggly Wiggly but still sees no sign of Carver's
           men.
           He moves quickly toward Juniper's door. Checking over his
           shoulder, he knocks. No answer. He knocks again. Nothing.
           He peeks through the window. No lights. No movement.

<b>          95 BY THE DIRT BIKE, 95
</b>           Neckbone gets off his bike and slips to the corner of the
           building. As he peeks his head out, Ellis nearly knocks him
           over on his way downstairs. They both flinch.

<b>                          NECKBONE

           The MOTEL CLERK(29) doesn't look up from his issue of

<b>          97 EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK 97
</b>
           Ellis and Neckbone pull into the gravel lot in front of a
           roadside bar. The cinder block building sits by itself just
           off the highway. Cars and motorcycles fill the lot.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           You think this is it?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           It's gotta be.

<b>          98 INT. ROADSIDE BAR - CONTINUOUS 98
</b>
           The small bar is loud and crowded. Shoulder to shoulder
           PATRONS bump against one another as MUSIC blares.
           Neckbone and Ellis press through the crowd searching for
           Juniper. They are a good foot shorter than anyone else.
           Ellis notices a man at the bar. It's Miller, the bounty
           hunter from King's motel. He's staring at something across
           the room. Ellis follows his line of sight.
           The crowd weaves in front of him, but then he sees her.
           Juniper leans against a pool table at the far end of the bar.
           A GUY(32) whispers in her ear and kisses her neck. She
           throws her head back, laughing. Ellis watches in disbelief.
           Nearby, the BARTENDER(46) fills a customer's shot glass. The
           two underage kids catch his attention.

<b>           87.
</b>
                         
           Ellis' face is frozen, locked on Juniper. Neckbone places a
           hand on his shoulder.
           Juniper's eyes drift toward the boys. She makes eye contact
           with Ellis, and her smile vanishes. The Guy keeps whispering
           in her ear. Juniper straightens her back slightly.
           Ellis can't take his eyes off her. Juniper stares back at
           him, but doesn't make a move.
           After a moment, Juniper's eyes fall to the floor. She turns
           her head back to the Guy. The crowd fills back in and the
           image is out of Ellis' reach.

<b>           BARTENDER (O.S.)
</b>           What the hell are ya'll doin'?!
           The Bartender swoops in, grabbing them both by the backs of
           their necks and shoving them toward the door. Ellis strains
           against the thick hand. He tries to get another look at
           Juniper, but it's too crowded.

                         

<b>          99 EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 99

           The Bartender flings Ellis and Neckbone into the parking lot.
           Neckbone slides on the loose gravel.

<b>                          BARTENDER
</b>           Ya'll stay outta here!
           Ellis just stands staring at the front door. The Bartender
           makes a swatting motion toward them.

<b>                          (TO ELLIS)

           They head over to Neckbone's dirt bike. He pulls out the key
           and climbs on. Ellis hesitates.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)

           Neckbone drops his head, nods reluctantly.

<b>          100 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 100
</b>
           The boys struggle to pull the heavy motor out of their boat.
           It hits the shoreline with a thud. They lean over it,
           sucking air.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Just leave it. Mud'll have to help
           get it.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I'll just tell him the truth.

<b>          101 EXT. ISLAND/SOUTHERN SHORE - NIGHT 101
</b>
           Mud stands at the back of the boat, which now rests on the
           boat trailer near the water. His face is clean shaven and
           his hair is wetted back. His shirt, still filthy, is tucked
           into his pants.
           He whistles and works by the light of a small fire nearby.
           Ellis steps out from behind a tree. He's holding the grocery
           sack that was left on his houseboat.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>
<b>           MUD!
</b>           Mud, hearing the voice, quickly puts down his tools and turns
           to the woods. He smooths his clothes down.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           What you say there?!
           Ellis appears out of the dark, followed by Neckbone. Mud's
           eyes search the treeline for Juniper.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           What you say Ellis?
           Ellis can't look him in the eye.

<b>                          ELLIS

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           It wasn't Carver.
          Mud straightens up, prepares for the news.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           What's goin' on Ellis?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           She was supposed to meet us on the
           side of the motel. She never
           showed up. We went asking for her.
           The motel clerk told us she went to
           a bar out on 61.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           What?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           We tracked her down. She was there
           with another guy.

<b>                          (HESITATES)
</b>           They were together.
          Mud's face drops. He walks to the fire and shakes a cooking
          pot resting in the coals. The pot bubbles with roof tar.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           She probably thought Carver was on
           to her.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           She knew the plan Mud. She just
           didn't show up.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           What was she doin' with the other
           guy?
          Ellis hesitates, not wanting to say. Mud pushes.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           What were they doin' Ellis?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           They were playin' pool. Drinkin'.
           He was close up on her. They were
           laughin'. He kissed her on the
           neck.
          Mud nods.

<b>           90.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           And that's how it is.
           He takes the pot of roofing tar over to the boat and begins
           pasting some of the newly replaced boards with a flat stick.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           What do you want us to do?

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Just go home Ellis.
           Ellis looks at Neckbone, then sets the grocery sack on the
           ground.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Tom left this for you.
           They slowly retreat into the woods and disappear.
           Mud turns back to the campfire and shoves the pot into the
           ashes. His eyes, soft and red, reflect the flame.

           Ellis and Neckbone motor away from the island in the flat
           bottom boat. They look back at the shore.

<b>                          ELLIS

           Ellis nods. As they head further up river, the island grows
           smaller, silhouetted by the moonlight.

<b>          103 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - MORNING 103

           Neckbone snores, sprawled out on top of a sleeping bag on the

          The front door flies open. Senior storms headlong toward

          out of Ellis' hand and smashes apart on the floor. Ellis
          flinches at the sight of his father flying at him.

          A cool anger rushes over Senior's face. He releases Ellis

          Senior volleys a finger at Ellis.

           remember this when you watch them
           rip this house apart board by
           board. You Hear Me!
          Mary Lee slaps Senior hard. He turns to her, saying nothing.

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           You're a man who's never had the
           strength to support his own life.
           I never asked you for a thing, and
           I've never took a thing from you
           that I couldn't provide for on my

           the only joy I'll have in my heart
           is knowin' that they'll be tearing
           you out of my life for good.
          She wipes her eyes and turns her attention to Ellis.

<b>           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
</b>           Ellis. You'll return that motor
           from where you found it and you'll
           apologize in person to the man you
           took it from. I won't hear about
           anything like this again.
          Mary Lee walks to the front door. She collects her purse and
          keys and exits quietly.
          Senior and Ellis stand in silence, which feels even more
          uncomfortable than the shouting. Ellis finally speaks.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I can't take that motor back. But
           I'll pay him for it. I'll pay him
           what he wants for it.
          Senior, stoic, pivots his body away from the boy.

<b>                          SENIOR
</b>           I don't care what you do Ellis.
          Senior retreats to the bedroom. Ellis is left alone in the
          wake.
          He looks to his room. The door opens slightly and Neckbone
          takes a step out. Neckbone doesn't say anything. He just
          bites at his lip, sympathy for his friend.

           Charred hunks of driftwood smolder in a ruined pile on the
           sand. They constitute the remains of a large bonfire.
           Neckbone and Ellis stare at the ash.

</b>           I guess he didn't care about bein'
           seen.
           Ellis kicks at one of the burned logs. He bends down and
           finds the bottle of Jack Daniels, smashed.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           He had something else on his mind.

           Ellis leads Neckbone into the treeline.

</b>
           Mud's yellow shirt hangs, partially ripped, from a tree
           branch. Ellis pulls it off the limb.
           Concerned, they head deeper into the woods, over the fallen
           tree trunk that bridges the creek.

<b>          107 EXT. ISLAND WOODS AND SOUTHERN SHORE - DAY 107
</b>
           The boys watch Mud through the trees at a distance. He's
           crouched on the deck of the boat fiddling with wiring. Mud,
           giving no sign he sees the boys, yells out to them.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           What are ya'll hidin' for?
           Mud drops the wiring and scales down to the bank. They
           emerge from the woods. Ellis carries the yellow shirt.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           We found your shirt.
           Ellis tosses it to him. Mud tosses it back.

</b>           Keep it. I don't need it anymore.
           Mud goes to the motor at the rear to tinker with more wires.

</b>           I did a lot of drinkin' last night.
          Mud stops and walks over to address the boys. His face is
          pale and his manner is curt.

          Ellis takes the letter. Mud goes back to the boat motor. He
          motions to Neckbone to join him.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Let's go.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           I had a dream last night. I saw
           Juniper laying in a field with
           another man. They were making
           love. I walked out into the field.
           Walked toward `em. I was so angry
           the tips of my ears were burnin'.
           That's how I knew I was gonna kill
           this man. But when I got up close
           enough, I saw that the man she was
           with had tattoos on his back, just
           like mine. I moved in closer and
           the guy turns his head back toward
           me. Hair for hair, dead truth, the
           guy she was with was me.
          Mud ducks back under the motor. Ellis looks at Neckbone,
          worried.

<b>           96.

</b>           I'll finish the boat, but I'd be
           surprised if I live long enough to
           sail on it. A vision of yourself
           is a sure sign of death. Neck can
           you grab me a socket wrench?
           Neckbone and Ellis walk to the toolbox sitting nearby. They
           crouch by it, speaking quietly.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           You be all right?

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Yeah. What about you?

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           He'll be okay.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Can I borrow your bike?
           Neckbone fishes the key out of his pocket. Hesitates.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Don't tump it.
           Ellis nods. Neckbone walks over to Mud with the toolbox.
           Letter in hand, Ellis gives a final look toward Mud's labor
           and walks back into the woods. On his way, he stops to hang
           Mud's shirt on a tree branch.

<b>          108 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY 108

           Ellis rides in the flat bottom boat alone. He stares at the
           letter in his hand.

<b>          109 EXT. PIGGLY WIGGLY - DAY 109

           Ellis sits on the dirt bike. He scans the parking lot. No
           black Lincoln. His eyes stop on a green pick-up. Miller,
           sits inside.
           Ellis looks around and finds a pay phone nearby. He gets off
           the bike and walks toward it. Ellis removes the flier Carver
           gave him. He dials a phone number copied at the bottom.

<b>                          ELLIS

           Ellis hangs up the phone. He walks back over to the bike,
           climbs on and waits.
           After a moment, he watches as Miller's green pick-up pulls
           out of the Piggly Wiggly parking lot and races away. Ellis
           cranks the bike.

           Ellis, at a slight crouch, keeps his eyes on the Piggly
           Wiggly parking lot. The green pick-up is nowhere in sight.
           At Juniper's door, he knocks twice, softly. The door swings
           opens. Juniper stands there, holding a lit cigarette.

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           I was wonderin' when I'd see you.
           Ellis checks over his shoulder and walks inside

<b>          111 INT. EXECUTIVE INN/JUNIPER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 111
</b>
           The bed is unmade and the room is a bit of a mess. Ellis
           keeps his head down. Juniper closes the door and takes a
           seat on the edge of the bed. She grabs the remote control
           and mutes the television.

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           I'm sorry about last night. I
           didn't plan on...
           Before she can finish Ellis has fished the letter out of his
           pocket and holds it out to her.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I'm supposed to give this to you.
           Juniper takes the letter.

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           Okay.
           Ellis goes to the door. He pulls the bedroom curtain back
           slightly to check the parking lot. The coast is clear.

<b>                          JUNIPER
</b>           You really believe that?
          Ellis nods. Juniper speaks to him gently, almost smiling.
          It's a look of resignation.

<b>                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)
</b>           Mud's a born liar. That's what
           makes him so likable. He makes
           people feel good about themselves.
           He's a romantic. I don't think he
           means to hurt people. But when
           people get close to him, that's
           what happens.
          Ellis watches her as she goes to the sink and wets the end of
          a towel. She dabs her eyes at the mirror.

<b>                          JUNIPER (CONT'D)

           of life I want, but I know that's
           not it.
          Her back to him, Ellis watches as she unfolds the letter and
          begins reading. He angles himself to see her face in the
          mirror. He watches her eyes scanning the words. No emotion.

           Ellis, dejected, no longer bothers to look over his shoulder.
           He walks to the staircase but stops there. Feeling the need
           to say something more, he goes back to her room.
           He puts his knuckle flat on the door but hesitates. He leans
           over and looks through the window.
           The sliver in the curtain gives him a glimpse. Juniper is
           curled up on the end of the bed. She is sobbing.
           Ellis watches longer than he should before pulling his head
           away from the window. Ellis heads back downstairs.

           Ellis, riding the dirtbike, looks to his left into the Sonic
           Drive-In parking lot. The high school kids have gathered
           there again.
           He notices a rust colored Ford coup. The driver, an older
           kid named KYLE(18), sits beside May Pearl laughing.
           Ellis steers into traffic and crosses the street. He pulls
           onto a patch of grass at the edge of the Sonic parking lot.
           In one motion, Ellis tumps the bike on its side and makes a b-
           line for the coup.

           much. I told her I thought he was
           all right.
          Ellis appears with his elbows in the driver's side window.
          He sticks his head so far in the door that Kyle has to lean
          back in his seat to make room. May Pearl is surprised. Kyle
          snorts out a laugh.

          Kyle slings the door open knocking Ellis to the pavement.
          From the ground, Ellis can see that Kyle is big and
          considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before.
          Kyle's friends from other cars take notice and begin to
          converge on them.
          Ellis makes a move for Kyle's legs but is kicked back to the
          pavement. Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him.
          Another punch to Ellis' face. May Pearl is out of the car
          and yelling.

<b>                          MAY PEARL
</b>           Kyle! Stop it Kyle!

<b>           101.
</b>
                         
          May Pearl pulls Kyle by the collar. By his own will, he
          raises off of Ellis, keeping an eye on him.
          A streak of blood stretches from Ellis' nose to his ear. He
          gets to his feet, dazed.
          Ellis wipes at his nose and sees May Pearl shove Kyle. Kyle
          smiles and turns to his friends, who laugh. The CROWD that
          has collected consists of older high school guys and girls.
          Ellis steps toward May Pearl and is met with a shove too.

<b>           MAY PEARL (CONT'D)

          The crowd is watching.

<b>                          MAY PEARL
</b>           I'm not your girlfriend! We went
           on one date. One!

<b>                          ELLIS

           love you.

<b>                          MAY PEARL
</b>           What?
           Ellis is losing it. His eyes are red. He looks at the crowd
           of kids. There are smiles and some snickering. May Pearl is
           speechless. She just stares at him.
           Ellis turns and walks back to the dirt bike.
           May Pearl's girlfriends gather around her. She shakes her
           head, dumbstruck.
           Ellis lifts the bike off the ground. He looks back at May
           Pearl who appears to be shrugging off the whole affair in
           front of her friends. Ellis speeds off.

<b>          114 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT/RIVERBANK - DAY 114
</b>
           A fire snaps and pops on the riverbank next to Ellis'
           houseboat.
           Ellis drags a piece of particle board from a trash pile
           nearby. He drops the board onto the fire and stands back to
           watch the blaze. Neckbone's bike leans on a tree behind him.
           Senior's truck rattles to a stop in the gravel just down the
           bank. He jumps out of the cab exasperated by the fire his
           son has started by their home.

<b>                          SENIOR
</b>           What the hell are you doin'?!
           Ellis says nothing. He doesn't move. Senior, continuing to
           yell, runs and drags a hose up from the houseboat.

<b>                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Ellis dammit! What the hell's
           wrong with you?!
           The fire hisses as Senior turns the hose on it.

<b>                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Ellis? Look at me.
           Ellis finally looks up at his father. A phone RINGS from
           inside the houseboat. Senior holds the hose in front of him.

<b>                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Take it. Put this damn thing out.

<b>           103.
</b>
                         
           Ellis takes the hose as Senior stomps on board to catch the
           phone. Ellis drops the hose.
           Senior's voice, speaking into the telephone, faintly carries
           outside. He's yelling. Ellis turns his head to listen.

<b>           SENIOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>           I don't give a shit! Fine! I
           don't care what you do! I'm done
           with it!
           Ellis moves around the fire so he can see the houseboat
           through the flames. He hears the phone SLAM down.
           Senior appears at the back door. He stares at Ellis through
           the fire. Ellis moves to the side but realizes Senior isn't
           staring at him. He's staring at the fire.
           Senior disappears back into the house. There is a commotion.
           Ellis watches as Senior bursts out of the house holding an
           armful of woman's clothes. Senior walks up to the bonfire
           and begins tossing clothes on top piece by piece.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           What are you doing?
           Ellis watches as dresses and blouses begin to shrivel up in
           the flames.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
</b>           Stop it! That's mom's stuff! STOP

<b>           IT!
</b>           Ellis shoves at Senior. He easily counters the boy with his
           arm and continues tossing the clothes into the fire. Ellis
           is screaming and crying.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           STOP IT! STOP!
</b>           Ellis tries yanking the remaining clothes out of his father's
           hands but Senior shakes him off. Ellis stumbles. He watches
           with tears as Senior tosses all of the clothes on.
           Senior watches his wife's clothes burn. Ellis backs away to
           the bike. He climbs on, cranks the engine and speeds off.

<b>          115 EXT. ISLAND SHORE - DAY 115
</b>
           Ellis grounds the flat-bottom on shore and jumps out.

<b>          116 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - DAY 116
</b>
           Ellis thrashes through the woods. His muddy feet stomp
           across the fallen tree trunk that bridges the creek.

</b>
           The boat rests on its trailer on the edge of the bank. Mud
           stands on board looking down at the motor. Neckbone, tools
           in hand, has his head buried in the motor.

<b>                          NECKBONE

           Ellis emerges from the treeline. Mud sees him and hops down
           from the boat. He walks up to him.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           What'd she...
           Ellis punches Mud with as much force as he can muster. It's
           barely enough to turn Mud's face, but it stuns him.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           You're a liar. Makin' two kids run

           it's over `cause you're too scared
           to do it yourself.
           Mud steps back and gives the boy his space. Neckbone has
           made his way over and watches from behind Mud.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)

           crosses. Wolf's eye bullshit.
           Mud tries to approach him but the boy explodes, shoving him.

</b>

           Mud holds a hand out to him. Ellis slaps it away.

           Ellis walks back into the woods. Mud exhales and turns back
           to Neckbone.

<b>                          NECKBONE

           Ellis walks through the woods. Neckbone follows.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           Ellis! Ellis, stop for a second!
           Neckbone watches as Ellis reaches the tree trunk that bridges
           the creek. Ellis steps onto the log, but his muddy shoes
           miss a step. He SLIPS.
           Neckbone sees Ellis disappear down into the creek bed.

<b>                          NECKBONE (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           ELLIS!
</b>           Neckbone rushes over. He cranes his neck out to peer over
           the edge, a solid eight foot drop into the creek.
           Ellis floats face up in the shallow water. He's unconscious.
           A wound on his head from a nearby rock.
           The nest of WATER MOCCASINS has been disturbed; SNAKES WRITHE

<b>           AROUND ELLIS' BODY.

           Mud stands at the rear of the boat massaging his jaw.

<b>           MUD! MUD!
</b>           Mud hears the yelling. Neckbone explodes from the trees.

<b>           MUD PLEASE!

           He snags it and darts into the woods.

<b>          120 EXT. ISLAND WOODS/CREEK - DAY 120
</b>
           Mud streaks through the woods as he gets his other arm
           through the shirt sleeve. He reaches the creek.
           Without hesitating, Mud leaps down into the water, scoops
           Ellis into his arms and scales up the opposite side of the
           creek bed.
           Mud sprints for the north side of the island. Neckbone
           chases after them.

<b>          121 EXT. NORTHERN SHORE AND RIVER - DAY 121
</b>
           Mud cradles Ellis in his arms as he rushes to the flat-bottom
           boat. He sets Ellis gently inside. Neckbone on his heels.
           Mud shoves the boat into the water and hops in. Neckbone
           wades out and crawls up the side of the boat.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Get the motor started.
           Neckbone cranks the motor. As they move up river, Mud
           searches Ellis' body. He looks at his neck, his arms, he
           pulls up his shirt.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           IS HE OKAY?! Is he bit?!
           Mud notices Ellis' jeans leg riding up. He pulls the jeans
           back. A BITE in the middle of his calf. It's a bluish
           bruise with two distinct red dots. The skin around the bite
           has already begun to swell.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           Shit.
           He rips the jeans up to the thigh. Mud tears a section of
           cloth from the bottom of his own shirt and creates a
           tourniquet just below Ellis' knee.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)

           Mud pulls a black Sharpie out of his pocket. Neckbone
           doesn't answer, just stares.

<b>                          NECKBONE

           Mud draws a line on Ellis' leg just above the swollen bite.
           He writes, "418".

<b>                          MUD

           Mud elevates Ellis' leg then gently cups his head. He dabs
           the gash on Ellis' forehead.

<b>                          NECKBONE

           Mud shakes his head.

<b>                          MUD
</b>           No.
           He holds Ellis as they move steadily up river.

<b>          122 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY 122

           The flat bottom boat approaches the riverbank. Neckbone
           points to the sandy ridge and yells up to Mud.

<b>                          NECKBONE
</b>           My bike should be just over that
           ridge!
           Mud looks at Ellis' leg. The swelling has crept up his
           thigh. Black lines with numbers mark its progress: "428,
           438, 448". Ellis' face has taken on a blue tint.

           The boat hasn't reached the shore, but Mud takes Ellis in his
           arms and jumps into the water. He wades onto the bank.

<b>          123 AT THE BIKE, 123
</b>           Mud straddles it, turning Ellis' body so they are face to
           face. He cranks the bike and speeds away.
           Neckbone makes it to the top of the ridge in time to see Mud
           disappear into the trees.

<b>          124 EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY 124

           Mud speeds the dirt bike down the two-lane highway. He's far
           too big for the bike and it's even trickier balancing Ellis.
           Coming up on a slow moving pick-up overloaded with junk, Mud
           veers into the opposing lane.

<b>           ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

           Mud appears around the corner. The bike speeding toward the
           entrance.
           In a fluid motion, Mud takes Ellis in his arms and lifts his
           leg over the bike. The bike tilts and slides across the
           pavement, smacking solidly into the curb.
           Mud has managed to stay on his feet with the boy in his arms
           and rushes through the automatic front doors.

</b>           A FEMALE NURSE rushes out of the check-in area.

<b>                          FEMALE NURSE

<b>                          MUD
</b>           He's been snake bit.
           ANOTHER NURSE rushes off calling for a doctor. The room
           becomes more frenzied. Patients talking. Nurses shouting.

<b>           109.

</b>           He's snake bit. A cotton mouth.
           On his calf. Just under an hour.
           As quickly as Mud gets this out, a GROUP of NURSES rush out
           of a door at the end of the room pushing a gurney.
           They take Ellis from Mud's arm, place him on the gurney, and
           speed him into the back of the clinic.
           The commotion gone, the reception area feels oddly still.
           Mud takes a deep breath.
           He looks to his right. Patients stare at him. He's beyond
           disheveled. He's crazy looking.
           Mud turns to his left. The Male Nurse stares at him. For
           the first time, Mud realizes he's out in the open.

<b>                          MALE NURSE
</b>           Sir?
           Mud slowly backs up.

<b>           MALE NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>           Sir? We're gonna need some
           information?
           Mud backs out of the automatic doors. The entire room stares
           at him.

<b>          127 EXT. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS 127

           Mud is outside. The glass doors close. He nervously checks
           over his shoulders. He spots a bank of trees just down from
           the clinic. He heads for them.
           The front doors slide open and the Male Nurse walks out.

<b>                          MALE NURSE
</b>           Sir?!
           Mud hops into the bank of trees and disappears.

<b>          128 INT. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS 128
</b>
           The Patients in the reception area settle back into their
           seats and discuss the commotion.
           The Male Nurse enters and walks behind the check-in window.

<b>           IN THE WINDOW,

           He removes one of the fliers that Carver and his men have
           been showing. The Nurse studies the photo, looking back at
           the front doors.
           He picks up the phone and dials the number at the bottom.

           In the adjoining room, the phone rings. King steps through

</b>           Hello...Yes...Yessir we are...Uh

           King takes a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on a pad

           The sun has been down for awhile. Juniper leans on the
           railing outside her room taking long drags from a cigarette.
           She sees Miller's green pick-up parked below.
           Suddenly the headlights pop on and the truck pulls away. She
           watches, curious, as it speeds out of sight.
           A train whistle blows in the distance but is overtaken by a
           semi rumbling down the street. She watches the semi pass
           revealing the DAY/NITE Gas Station's parking lot.
          A130 MUD STANDS IN THE CORNER OF THE LOT. Half lit by a sodium A130
           lamp, he stares up at her.
           Juniper raises up. Even in the dim light she knows it's him.
           She doesn't move.
           Mud holds up a hand, waves. Juniper slowly waves back.
           She tries to smile at him, but she's about to cry and it's
           hard to muster.
           Mud smiles. After a long moment, he turns his back and
           disappears in the shadows at the side of the gas station.
           Juniper watches after him.

           Ellis is on his back. Eyes closed. His head jostles at the
           SOUND of THUMPING. More THUMPING. It sounds like the hood
           of a car denting in.
           His eyes open. He stares up at an absurdly full moon. It's
           so bright it totally silhouettes the tree branches overhead.
           The THUMPING continues. Ellis puts his hands on the edge of
           the flat-bottom boat he's floating in and pulls himself up.
           He leans over the side to see what's causing the noise.
           The water is jet black. The entire bayou pulsates. Ellis'
           eyes grow wide as the THUMPING reveals itself.

<b>           THE BAYOU IS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH SNAKES.
</b>           The moonlight illuminates their shiny black backs as they
           twist and churn in what seems like one giant ball of snakes.
           Ellis lies back in the boat bringing his arms close to his
           chest. He flinches at each THUMP. His eyes squeeze shut.

<b>          132 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT 132
</b>
           His eyes open. Ellis bolts up in bed covered in a cold
           sweat. Mary Lee places a palm on his chest.

<b>                          MARY LEE
</b>           It's okay. You're okay. Just set
           back.
           Mary Lee guides Ellis back down on the pillow. Senior stands
           with his arm on her shoulder. They look down at their son.

<b>                          ELLIS

           Ellis takes a second to get his bearings. His mother lifts a
           glass of Sprite up to his mouth. He takes a sip.

<b>                          SENIOR

           Senior steps forward and kisses Ellis on the forehead.

           him.
           Ellis tries to sit up in bed, but his mother stops him.

<b>           MARY LEE (CONT'D)
</b>           It's okay. You just need to rest
           up now. We can talk all about it

<b>                          ELLIS

           Senior gently pats her shoulders.

<b>                          SENIOR
</b>           Come on. Let's let him rest.
           Mary Lee touches Senior's hand on her shoulder. She stands.

</b>           I'll be back in to check on you but
           just try and sleep if you can.

<b>                          ELLIS

           Senior leads Mary Lee to the door.

<b>                          ELLIS (CONT'D)

           They turn back.

           They exit the room. Ellis rests his head back on the pillow
           and takes a deep breath.

           Mud and Neckbone shove against the back of the boat trailer.
           The wheels of the trailer rock at the edge of the bank's
           incline. Sheets of metal roofing taken from the shack Ellis
           and Neckbone dismantled line a runway into the water.

</b>           Almost there.
          The wheels finally turn over. The trailer rolls down the
          bank and splashes into the water. The boat shimmies.
          Mud and Neckbone follow the trailer into knee deep water and
          shove on the boat. A final push jettisons it into the river.
          They step back as the boat drifts out. A rope tied to its
          back becomes taught as it stretches from a tree on shore.

          Mud walks back on shore and collects his duffel bag.

<b>                          MUD (CONT'D)
</b>           I owe you your end of the deal.
          Mud removes the pistol from the back of his jeans.
          Neckbone's eyes light up. Mud hands it over and Neckbone
          immediately notices a hole where the clip is missing.

          Neckbone begrudgingly crams the pistol into the back of his
          pants.

           From the darkness, Neckbone and Mud appear in the flat-bottom
           boat. They paddle with their hands. Approaching in silence.

<b>          135 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - NIGHT 135

           Ellis stares at the ceiling, unable to sleep. A TAP comes
           from the window. Ellis sits up in bed. Mud pokes his head
           in. He whispers.

           Mud pulls his body through the window. It's tight but he
           manages to make it look somewhat graceful. Mud takes a quick
           survey of the dark room. Ellis begins to get out of bed.

           Through the holes Mud sees Nelson approaching Ellis' bedroom.
           He runs for the window at the foot of the bed. Another
           shotgun BLAST throws open the door as Mud leaps out.

           Mud crashes headfirst onto the edge of the houseboat grasping
           for anything to keep from sliding off. His hand catches a
           metal deck cleat. It bends under his weight but holds.
           Mud gets to his feet and is met by the tip of a rifle.
           Miller, the man from the cafe, stands poised to fire.
           Mud's hand slips to the back of his pants for his pistol.
           NOTHING. He looks to the flat-bottom tied at the far edge of
           the boat. No sign of Neckbone.
           Miller's finger curls around the trigger.
           SUDDENLY, a BULLET snicks through Miller's neck.
           Mud flinches. Miller's hand comes up to his neck but can't
           hold the blood running from it. He topples into the water.

           Tom Blankenship sits in the folding chair on the roof of his
           houseboat. He shucks an empty shell from a HIGH-POWERED
           RIFLE complete with scope. The long suitcase from the photo
           in Tom's house sits open at his feet. It has compartments
           for the disassembled rifle.
           Tom quickly raises to a new firing position. He squints an
           eye, searching for another target.
          A141 From this vantage point, Ellis' houseboat is clearly visible;

           Still under the bed, Ellis tries to hold his breath as

           before sluggishly struggling through the bedroom window.

           A BULLET splinters the corner of the dock sending shards of
           wood into Mud's hand. He sees TWO more GUNMEN skirting
           toward him on the deck of the houseboat.
           Mud takes cover against the wall and finds the muzzle of
           Nelson's gun teetering out Ellis' window. He grabs the
           muzzle and yanks the shotgun free.
           Nelson, stuck in the window, looks up in time to take a rifle
           butt in the face. He falls back into the room unconscious.

           Senior, propped against the closed door, uses his undershirt
           to dab the pellet wounds around his neck.
           Hearing footsteps, he cracks the door open. He sees Mud
           standing in the den. Senior cocks his pistol

<b>          149 IN THE DEN, 149

           as a Bounty Hunter fires through the doorway.
           The back of the Lazy Boy explodes in fluff and fabric. Mud
           raises up to return fire, forcing the Man back out the door.
           Mud crouches back behind the Lazy Boy. Unbeknownst to him,
           another MAN appears outside two sliding glass doors. The Man
           raises his rifle at Mud.
           One of Tom's bullets rips through the Man's chest and
           shatters the glass door. Mud flinches. Another Hunter steps
           into the now broken door frame. Mud FIRES the shotgun,
           blowing the man into the patio grill.
          A149 Mud can see Tom's houseboat silhouetted across the A149
           bayou. A muzzle FLASH sparks from the top of Tom's
           boat. This makes Mud smile.
          150 The Front Door kicks open again and more pellets shatter 150
           through the den. Mud raises to return fire.

           next to the bedroom door. He peeks through a crack.
           He sees Mud pinned behind the Lazy Boy. They make eye

           Ellis turns to see James passing by his bedroom window.

           Tom scans Ellis' boat through the scope on his rifle. He

<b>          169 I/E. SENIOR'S TRUCK/NEW APARTMENTS - DAY 169
</b>           Senior's truck pulls into the parking lot of a newly finished
           apartment complex. The two-story buildings are modest.
           The truck idles out front.

<b>           INSIDE THE CAB,
</b>           Ellis grabs the door handle. He turns to Senior.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           I'll see you next week?

<b>                          SENIOR
</b>           Yeah.
           Ellis begins to get out but stops when Senior speaks.

<b>                          SENIOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Ellis? You mind your mother okay?
           This is a big change for her. She
           needs your support.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Yessir.

<b>                          SENIOR
</b>           All right. I love you.

<b>                          ELLIS
</b>           Love you too.

           Ellis climbs out. He watches as Senior pulls away.
           He stands alone in front of the apartments, studying the
           surroundings. A busy road out front. A gas station and
           collection of stores. A lot of people and commotion.
           A compact car pulls into a parking spot one building down.

           Ellis watches as three COLLEGE AGE GIRLS climb out dressed in
           running shorts and t-shirts. Two are heavy set, the other is
           petite. They joke and laugh. One sees Ellis and waves.
           Ellis nods to her. He tracks them as they walk inside.
           Ellis smirks.

<b>          170 EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY 170
</b>
           The river rushes past. A large motor churns the water.

<b>           126.
</b>
                         
           Tom stands steering Mud's salvaged boat down river. He
           cranes his neck, seeing something up ahead.
           Tom kills the motor. Looking out over the bow, he's pleased
           by what he sees. His eyes glint, almost a smile. He walks
           to the small cabin and enters.

<b>          171 INSIDE THE CABIN, 171
</b>           Mud rests flat on his stomach on the cushioned bench.
           Shirtless, gauze bandages wrap around his chest and back.
           He's sleeping.
           Tom walks in and kneels next to him. Touches his shoulder.
           Mud's eyes open.

<b>                          TOM
</b>           Come on son. You need to see this.
           Mud, groggy, raises up. Tom helps him to his feet, putting
           an arm over his shoulders. Tom practically carries Mud
           outside.

<b>          172 ON DECK, 172
</b>           Tom and Mud slowly maneuver out the door and take a place
           near the front of the boat.
           Mud pulls his head up. Looks out ahead. The sight in front
           of him grabs his attention. He perks up.
           A tributary from the Mississippi river opens up into a vast
           stretch of ocean.
           Mud smiles, showing the missing tooth.
           Tom and Mud stand on deck as their boat drifts slowly into
           the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
           The End.
