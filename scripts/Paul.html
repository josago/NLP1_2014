          The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A
          light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small
          dog and a young girl emerge.

<b>                         GIRL
</b>          Go on now Paul, don't be long.

          The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.
          The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing
          the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low
          humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow
          reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers
          Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,
          bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange
          glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.

<b>                         GIRL
</b>          Paul... Paul?
          The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.

<b>                         GIRL
</b>          Paul?!
          The glow fades again.

          GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the
          blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM
          is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy
          hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears
          a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His
          hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.
          Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps.
          As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the
          road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their
          way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is
          brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight,
          the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of
          the blade. He nods appreciatively.

          On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA -

          the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini
          rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser
          whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and

<b>          EXT. HOTEL - MORNING
</b>
          The boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from
          across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A
          valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.

<b>                         VALET
</b>          There you go.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          That's not ours.

<b>                         VALET
</b>          No?

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          No, that's ours.
          A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of
          the range in its day. Still looks good.

<b>                         VALET
</b>          Oh.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from
          the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to
          the car for some small change. The BORG drive off.

<b>                         VALET
</b>          Fucking Borg.
          (giving the finger)
          Assimilate this!
          The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          can be heard whooping within.

<b>          INT. RV - MORNING
</b>
          CLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears
          black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM
          fusses with maps and provisions.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Breakfast?

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Java. Straight up.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Any solids?

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          No, let's punch through. Miles make
          the eggs taste sweeter.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          I love eggs!

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          I hear that. Now, get that "ËJoe' on
          the go and jump in the Chewie seat.
          I need your map skills.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Good job I pre-pared.
          GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's
          (Chewie) seat.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          It's a shame I don't have some
          controls on this side. That way, I
          could take over if you needed the
          loo.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Yeah, I could say "take the helm."ï¿½

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          "Take the helm, number one."ï¿½

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I
          need a number two."ï¿½
          They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out
          his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.

          continual info stream?

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Impressive.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Most impressive.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          And let's not forget, we've always
          got Analogue.
          GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Not when we're driving Graham.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Sorry.
          GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee
          percolator gurgles in the galley.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Sounds like coffee o'clock.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've
          had my first cup of J.
          GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.

<b>          INT. DINER - DAY
</b>
          GRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of
          prawns. He inspects the shells.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Looks like a pile of dead droids.
          A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and
          awkward.

<b>                         WAITRESS
</b>          You boys all set? Can I get you
          anything else?
          GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.

<b>          INT/EXT. RV - DAY
</b>
          They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Amazing, isn't it? There are
          295,734,134 people in this country
          and we haven't seen a soul for a
          hundred miles. Where is everybody?

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          What about that old woman on
          crutches we saw hitchhiking?

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Apart from her. I suppose that's
          why they established the Dreamland
          facility out here.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Far from prying eyes.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Did you know the site was selected
          in the mid-1950s for testing of the
          U-2 spyplane, due to its
          remoteness, proximity to existing
          facilities and presence of a dry
          lake bad for landings?

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Yes.

<b>                         CLIVE

</b>          Before.

<b>          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING
</b>
          GRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only
          customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51
          related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor,
          speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two
          bumper stickers.

<b>                         PAT
</b>          "Watch The Skies"ï¿½ or "Alien
          Onboard?"ï¿½
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before
          looking back at PAT.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          How could you tell?
          We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like
          the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.

<b>                         PAT
</b>          Just a guess. My nephew launched a
          comic down there a couple of years
          ago. Sort of dramatized the
          accounts of some of the folk we've
          had in here.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Do you get a lot of UFO types round
          here?
          We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien
          paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.

<b>                         PAT

<b>                         PAT
</b>          Well, I don't know what they were.
          So as far as I'm concerned they're
          unidentified and they were
          definitely flying.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          And objects.

<b>                         PAT
</b>          Damn straight. Whether or not they
          were spaceships, I can't say.
          Probably not, but I'd like to think
          they were. Be a shame if we were
          the only souls in the universe.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Did you now, it's estimated that
          there are as many as 200 billion
          galaxies in the observable universe
          and each of those has approximately
          40 billion starts, around which
          orbit countless planets and moons?

<b>                         PAT
</b>          Yes.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Oh.

<b>                         PAT

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          What?

<b>                         PAT

</b>          You boys all set?

<b>                         CLIVE

<b>                         PAT

          She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in.

<b>                         CLIVE

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          I think I might use the loo.
          CLIVE walks through a door marked "ËMaliens'. The adjacent
          toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.

<b>                         PAT

<b>                         JAKE

          CLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which
          is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its
          mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.

<b>                         CLIVE

</b>          Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up
          into my palms.
          CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He
          strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          I'm joking, of course. They have a

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          What?
          CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back.
          CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.

<b>          PAT (O.S.)
</b>          Here it comes!
          GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two
          men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of
          drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd
          looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.

<b>                         PAT

          A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt
          with a sparkler for the boys from
          outer space.
          The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.

          The RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a
          moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door

          CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A
          BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to
          avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes
          widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,
          bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on
          its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.

<b>                         CLIVE

          GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE
          remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled
          Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.

          sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a
          cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,
          black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.

</b>          Seriously, I wouldn't do that.

          GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps
          into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front

          backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.

</b>          Could have been worse. Know what
          I'm saying?
          They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds
          later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.
          He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV
          starts up and drives off.

          GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of
          times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.

</b>          Great!
          PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,
          wolfing it down hungrily.

          dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited
          man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first.
          The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his
          mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time.
          Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A

<b>                         CAPTAIN
</b>          What's this?
          The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.
          ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.

          He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the
          side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to
          his car and hits a button on the dash.

          Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear
          the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He
          notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to
          see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the
          bathroom door. The toilet flushes.
          CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of

          The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two

          distance before righting itself and continuing on its way.

          slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens
          its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what
          they are seeing.

</b>          You know...
          PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating
          various "Ëgroup' and "Ëone on one' homosexual practices.

</b>          No!

</b>          Okay, that's great. I just
          wondered. I'm cool with it.
          Everyone's "Ëbi' where I'm from.
          It's all about the pleasure thing,
          you know? We've evolved beyond
          paranoid notions of gender
          identity. I mean, procreation is
          only the functional aspect of
          sexual congress right? The human
          race is fairly advanced but most
          males still act like a cornered
          tiger if you imply the like
          "Ësmoking the bone' and let's face
          it they probably do. Look at single
          sex, empirical institutions,
          boarding schools, prisons, pirate
          ships, places where the choice has
          been removed, everyone's banging
          everyone else and there isn't a
          whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get
          out into the real world and guys
          are getting smacked int he chops
          for wearing pink socks. You think
          you're so sophisticated because you
          can distinguish yourself from your
          own reflection but ultimately
          you're part of a deeply neurotic
          species and you'd all be a lot
          better off if you stopped worrying
          and learned to love the bum.

          wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares

          of old Pan Am jets and mini disc
          players and shit. It's another
          "clever subterfuge."ï¿½
          GRAHAM joins them with the food.

</b>          Just telling him about Area 52.

</b>          Ha ha yeah.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          So, with my cover blown and the
          natives cautious but friendly, I
          figured we might as well indulge in
          a little file sharing.

</b>          Mulder was right!

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Mulder was my idea.
          They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          Would you like a go?
          PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the
          Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.

<b>          EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT
</b>
          RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are
          on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three
          pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted
          against the campfire. She frowns.

          There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.

          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens
          the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.

          of them and it ceases to exist. It
          has the precision and delicacy of a
          pocket watch and, when the good
          Lord permits, it works in perfect
          harmony with its environment.
          Something as functionally perfect

          RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls
          up, her hair turns white. She collapses.

<b>                         PAUL

          The door opens, seemingly by itself. PAUL materializes in the
          kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passport.
          He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until he
          spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport and
          finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.

          MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's
          arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a
          booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the
          RV careens off out of the trailer park.

          PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her
          forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up
          into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The
          cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's
          ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL

<b>                         RUTH

          GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. PAUL hangs
          back. RUTH emerges from the bedroom. She has swapped her
          Darwin T-shirt for one of GRAHAM's. It's an X-files T-shirt
          emblazoned with a UFO and the legend, I WANT TO BELIEVE.

          Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.

          sit in silence for a while.

<b>                         GRAHAM

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          The little girl who found me when I
          crashed. It was terrible actually.
          I killed her dog. I didn't mean to!
          My ship sort of landed on it. When
          the military arrived I was
          delirious; I kept saying "Paul?
          Paul?"ï¿½ It was the only English I
          knew, because I'd heard the little
          girl saying it over and over.

          Think about her everyday though.
          PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL
          takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM,
          CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though
          governed by some kind of psychic link.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily
          in this situation Graham and I
          would be looking up at the stars,
          wondering about life on other
          planets but we know now, don't we?
          It's a bit of an anti-climax.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Thanks a bunch, Hurley.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          I don't mean that in a bad way.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Paul, can I ask you something?

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Shoot.

<b>                         GRAHAM

</b>          I've outlived my usefulness.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          How so?

<b>                         PAUL

          can share about the universe and
          quantum theory and how to make a
          really nice meatball sandwich. The
          only thing I have to offer them now
          are my abilities.

</b>          So the only way they're going to
          get hold of them is by obtaining
          some of somatic stem cells.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Negative.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Believe me, a needle would be a
          picnic compared to what they had in
          store for me.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          I don't follow.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Stem cells are multipotent.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Lineage defined?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.

<b>          PAUL (CONT'D)

<b>                         GRAHAM

<b>                         PAUL

          beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three

</b>          Sorry, I get this thing when I get

          thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer.
          The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.
          Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet
          town of last night has become very busy indeed.

          GRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them
          is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the
          shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.

<b>                         PAUL

          hands with a child cowboy.

<b>                         CLIVE

          GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks
          back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC
          SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con.
          The tag reads "ËGenuine "ËBLADE' Katana'. $299.99.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Clive, no.
          CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly
          behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from
          the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers
          and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road,
          scanning the passers by.

<b>          INT. COMIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          GRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the
          blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He
          picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot
          like him. The comic is called "ËEncounter Briefs: Tales From
          the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly
          realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8)
          small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the
          cover of the comic and back at PAUL.

<b>                         PAUL

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          You an M&Ms man, Keith?
          PAUL produces his M&Ms. He offers one to KEITH.

          that makes us pals.

<b>                         KEITH NASH
</b>          Guess so.
          KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms. They turn their
          attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out
          called "ËG-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike
          ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          You read this one?

          under his arm and a big grin on his face.

</b>          Oh, that's a relief.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Look, the way you're feeling now,
          that's why religion appeared in the
          first place. It's like existential
          Prozac. Imagine being five year
          sold and having no adults around to
          tell you why it snows or what trees
          are for. That's how it is for much
          of humanity. Faith is a night-
          light. It illuminates the scary
          corners, fills the gaps, makes the
          universe easier to comprehend.
          Thing is, it's okay not to know
          everything. I mean, who knows
          what's really out there? Did you
          know astrophysicists recently
          identified the equation for the
          creation of matter?

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          Yes.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Oh. Well, then you get it, right?
          If they have the theory, who's to
          say at some point in the future
          they won't put it into practice and
          who's to say someone else didn't do
          that 13.5 Billion years ago and
          that's how the universe came to be?
          Course, then we get the eternal
          problem of who created the creator
          but that's a whole other car park.
          I think Shakespeare said it best.

          trying to convince folk about what
          happened that night. My parents, my
          friends. Everyone thought I was
          mad. They told me it was a meteor
          that squashed little Paul. Took me
          away and did tests they did, said
          it was for cosmic radiation. They
          said I was concussed,
          hallucinating, but I knew you were
          real. I pulled you from that
          spaceship myself. Sat with you till
          the men came and took you away. If
          Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he
          would have seen you too. They kept
          telling me I'd imagined it but I
          knew different. Pop tried to
          understand but they filled his head
          with "Ëdelayed this' and "Ëpost-
          traumatic that'. He just used to
          smile and say "Ëthere, there Tara'.
          He got sick when I was seventeen
          and died a few years later. I
          inherited this place. Word got out
          about my story not long after it
          happened, so I didn't really have
          any friends. Kids used to throw
          stones at the house and call me
          names. I just kinda retreated into
          myself. I'd spend whole nights up
          on the roof, staring at the sky,
          hoping to catch a glimpse of you
          again. I always believed that one

          are.

          series of ladders, all the way to

          Rogers in 1893. He was the first

          spare ammo and a webbing pack which he slings around his

          corner the landscape changes, the trees give way to a piece
          of open pasture flanked by pine forest, the tower opens
          itself up slightly, a perfect natural amphitheatre.

          ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the
          cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework
          rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive
          and bright red, it illuminates the tower.

          ZOIL leaps a fallen tree. Ahead, through the trees, he sees

          through the trees behind them.

          bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the
          bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the
          bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes
          past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.
          ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second
          shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He
          leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the
          cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his
          shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,
          holding a smoking gun.

<b>          114.
</b>          BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to
          see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white,
          his eyes wide.

<b>                         MOSES BEHE
</b>          Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Noooooooooo!
          GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of
          blood around her mouth.

<b>                         MOSES BEHE
</b>          I...I never meant to shoot her. I
          was aiming for the goblin.

<b>                         CLIVE
</b>          He's not a goblin he's from another
          planet.

<b>                         MOSES BEHE
</b>          But he can't be. He... he...

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          He's an alien you stupid man! Oh
          Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
          I should have never persuaded you
          to come with us.
          RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          What, and miss all this? Graham,
          I've lived more in the last 48
          hours that I ever did in that
          trailer park. Isn't that what you
          said living was all about? Right
          now? This conversation? That tree?
          My next cheeseburger? I'm not
          afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold
          though. Hey, where is everybody?
          RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM
          buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled
          with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.

<b>                         MOSES BEHE
</b>          What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so
          sorry.
          A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,
          silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          There is no way this thing isn't
          gonna end happy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          115.
</b>          PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.
          MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.

<b>                         MOSES BEHE
</b>          Get away from her! Don't you touch
          my little girl.
          CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,
          charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone
          watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some
          difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks
          both shining, healthy eyes.

<b>                         GRAHAM
</b>          Ruth, are you okay?

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          I think so. Is anyone hungry? I
          really feel like a cheese burger.
          Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his
          knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up
          to see PAUL.

<b>                         MOSES BEHE
</b>          Thank you.
          RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          You can kiss me now.
          They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a
          bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Looks like the geek shall inherit
          the earth.

<b>                         VOICE
</b>          I wouldn't say-

<b>          SPLAT.
</b>          A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks
          shocked. PAUL, GRAHAM and CLIVE exchange a look.

          Some time has passed, a number of PAUL style aliens are now

</b>          One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE
          from the hull of the ship. Another two help the now healed
          soldier to their feet, patting them on the back and shaking
          their hands. The atmosphere is amiable.
          TEAM PAUL look at one another. ZOIL and MOSES have joined
          them. PAUL kisses and hugs RUTH.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          I'm sorry I frightened you so much
          your hair turned white.

<b>                         RUTH
</b>          You didn't frighten me. You freed

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Whatever dude.
          They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a
          makeshift sling and shakes his hand.

<b>          PAUL (CONT'D)
</b>          Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man.

          PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN
          OF THE VARVAK from his pocket and hands it to them.

<b>                         CLIVE

<b>                         PAUL

          They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.

<b>          PAUL (CONT'D)
</b>          This is a self-sustaining light
          orb. Might come in handy, you know,
          if a bulb goes.
          TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face
          drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.

<b>          PAUL (CONT'D)

          TARA takes PAUL's hand.

          need teeth.
          TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in
          the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small
          room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue.

          As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the
          CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh,
          tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM,
          CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the
          ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness. Pause.

          They look more confident, cooler. CLIVE is talking to a short
