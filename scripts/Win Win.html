          It's a bitter cold January morning. The woods are quiet.
          Desolate. In the far off distance a man is jogging. He banks
          around the end of a small pond and runs right at us. This is
          MIKE FLAHERTY, FORTY-TWO. He is running hard. Or at least as
          hard as he can.
                         
          Suddenly TWO JOGGERS blow past him.

          A HOME MADE STAIN GLASS ANGEL hangs on a window. It falls to
          the ground.
                         
          ABBY FLAHERTY, SIX-YEARS OLD, stirs and gets out of her bed
          out. She picks up the Bird and inspects it. It's broken.

          Jackie prepares some food. She knocks a glass over into the
          sink and it breaks.

          kicking a leg back between the Other Wrestler's legs. He

          Stemler almost manages a smile and then he hits "the move".
          It's not pretty but somehow he manages to get up and out. The

          The Other kid frantically tries to take him down but Stemler
          holds him off dancing wildly around the mat. The buzzer
          sounds. The team goes nuts.
                         
          The Ref raises the other wrestler's hand in victory but it's
          Stemler who celebrates as if he just won the states. He runs
          off the mat and into the arms of his teammates.

          Mike is sitting alone at the kitchen table drinking a cup of
          coffee. The remnants of a pancake breakfast are on the table.
          There is one clean plate where Kyle usually sits.
                         
          After a moment, Kyle comes up from the basement and sits down
          at the table without saying anything.
                         
          He just looks at Mike. Then he serves himself a few pancakes.
          Mike passes him the bottle of syrup. He takes it and puts
