<b>          EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT
</b>

<b>                         FADE UP:
</b>          Moving through a tract development. The houses are like
          Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same, just
          mixed differently.
          A gloomy night, no moon. And a slightly ominous pattern
          emerges...
          Green, thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut
          brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and
          pizza joint flyers.
          Each third or fourth house is FOR SALE or, worse, seemingly
          abandoned. This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town.
          A deep, commanding voice pierces the silence:

<b>          VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Defy reason. Defy everything you
          know.
          Now we move in on one of the homes. Not the nicest on the
          block, but inhabited. Lights on in the windows.

<b>          INT. SUBURBAN HOME/VARIOUS -- NIGHT
</b>
          Inside the house. A middle-class family lives here. The
          living room is empty, but the TV's on.

<b>          ON THE TELEVISION
</b>          A commercial for PETER VINCENT. A Las Vegas institution,
          he's a magician whose show is all Gothic, horror-movie
          imagery.
          Peter's wiry, hot -- a rock and roll bad boy. He's cutting a
          girl up with a chain saw. And grinning like a mad man.

<b>                         TELEVISION ANNOUNCER
</b>          Peter Vincent's "FRIGHT NIGHT."
          The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left
          of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box.

          Now we hear what at first sounds like a MUFFLED ARGUMENT
          coming from another room.

<b>                         DISTANT VOICE
</b>          Get off her!!
          More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly
          domestic scene.
          We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps
          through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes
          toward us.
          He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind
          terror.
          We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A
          teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping.
          We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if
          something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it.
          We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered,
          as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the
          wall, which Adam nearly falls over.

<b>          INT. SUBURBAN HOME -- UPPER LANDING/BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</b>
          ADAM RACES INTO HIS PARENTS' ROOM. Another horrible glimpse -
          - his mother's body splayed across her frilly bed.
          Blood on pale pink sheets.
          ADAM goes to his FATHER'S SIDE OF THE BED and now we see
          Adam's father's body. His father was reaching for A GUN he'd
          hidden under the bed.
          ADAM gets down under the bed, desperately reaches for the
          gun. It's just beyond his grasp.

<b>                         ADAM
</b>          Come on, come on, come on...
          He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in
          his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry.

</b>
<b>                         ADAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on, come on!
          He finds them, struggles to unlock the gun with shaking
          hands.
          THE BED IS TURNED OVER in one violent throw. Adam is
          exposed. We see only a hint of the creature that looms over

<b>                         HIM --
</b>          Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin...
          Human but not quite.
          Adam reacts in horror. He knows he's dead.
          HE's RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear:

<b>           DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
</b>           .we're looking at a nice day here
           in Clark County, hitting a season
          low of only 89 degrees...

<b>          EXT. SHADOW HILLS - DAY
</b>
          MUSIC starts under the DISC JOCKEY as we LOOK DOWN FROM HIGH
          ABOVE at the SAME suburban neighborhood as before.
          In the daylight it seems nice. Charming, even.
          Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride bikes
          in the street. Mothers unload groceries. Neighbors chat.

<b>          DISC JOCKEY (O.S.)
</b>          .so get out there and enjoy this
          beautiful Wednesday, people.
          We SWOOP CLOSER and find that RADIO comes from a passing
          MINIVAN with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the
          rear window.
          The FOR SALE SIGNS and brown lawns don't seem nearly so
          foreboding now.
          We SWOOP UP AGAIN and see beyond Shadow Hills, past the WALL
          that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time
          that the community is SURROUNDED BY FLAT, ARID DESERT.
          In the distance, we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas
          proper. It looks like a distant fantasy, a land-locked
          Pleasure Island.

</b>          The wheels of a DIRT BIKE as it zooms down the street.
          WIDEN to see CHARLIE BREWSTER, who is PUSHING the bike as
          fast as he can. It STARTS, sputters -- then craps out.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          (to the bike/pissed)
          You want me to take you apart, huh?
          Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who
           just recently came into his body and good looks.
          He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite
          trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          (still talking to bike)
          I will. I'll sell you for parts.
          Don't think I won't--
          Charlie stops, embarrassed. DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches
           him talk to his bike. Paused as she hauls her trash cans to
          the curb.
          She's super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her
          ridiculous body. Stripper city. She nods to the bike,
          amused.

<b>                         DORIS
</b>          Nothing doing, huh?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          The thing's got no ambition.
          (re: trash cans)
          Can I -- uh, give you a hand?

<b>                         DORIS
</b>          I got it. Thanks.
          She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word "LUCKY" across
          the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice
          his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          Don't leer at the neighbors, kid.
          Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE
          brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb.

          which has only recently started to have more edge.

</b>          She's the one who put a word on her
          butt. I'm just reading it.
          Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in
          front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S YARD.

<b>                         JANE

</b>          Good. Hasn't dumped me yet.
          He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          That'll teach you to get so tall
          and handsome.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          Getting what you want is stressful.
          Especially when you're not used to
          it. More to lose.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Are you reading those books again?
          The Power of Whatever the Hell?
          She laughs. He glances at the DUMPSTER.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          They're not working. You're still

</b>          Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading OPEN
          HOUSE SIGNS into her trunk. Charlie stands there. She
          shoots him a look -- then he helps her load.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          It's an eyesore. I'm trying to

</b>          The guy moves in and puts a giant
          trash can in his yard! When the
          Perry's lived there--
          Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          The Perry's were the greatest
          neighbors ever. But they moved. I
          thought you were happy their place
          finally sold.

<b>                         JANE
</b>          (back on the neighbor)
          He's not digging a pool. Where do

          coming from?

<b>                         CHARLIE

<b>                         JANE
</b>          He's thirteen feet from our house.
          That's not spying, that's
          observing.
          A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot
          friends, CARA and BEE, sit in the back.

          playing catch up.
          Charlie moves toward the VW. Jane calls after him.

<b>                         JANE (CONT'D)

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Kinda defeats the purpose.
          He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.

          Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs
          his backpack and RACES after her.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting.

</b>          Brain? I -- what? No, I'm--
          But she's already walking away.

          He watches her move off, anxious and smitten.

          Charlie arrives with Amy, Cara and Bee -- all the girls now
          sport coffee drinks. Charlie has one too, with whipped cream
          and the works.

<b>          MARK (O.S.)
</b>          Ladies!
          A couple of handsome jock-type guys, MARK and BEN, roll up
          along side Charlie and the girls. They draw looks from other
          students as they move through the courtyard.
          The cool kids.

<b>                         BEE

<b>                         MARK
</b>          (to Charlie/re: drink)
          Seriously? A Mochachino? You
          can't ride with the girls anymore.
          You let them brush your hair, My
          Pretty Pony?
          Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it.

          Chuck's secure, aren't you?
          We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design.
          It's a thing. Charlie shows his off -- he's secure.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          You know, the formal. Don't think
          I wasn't going to ask you, because
          I thought it was an obvious go.
          Together. Hope, puppies, kittens,

</b>          Oh, no. Please. Nobody goes to
          the dance senior year.
          She smiles, moves off. He watches her, lets out a breath.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Right. I knew that.
          MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow.
          Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie:

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp
          man? Make a sacrifice to the hot

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Game, my friend. Rock solid.
          Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we
          see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a
          bitch. Mark calls after him--

<b>                         MARK
</b>          You don't even have a car!

<b>          INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY

          Later. Charlie's in Econ class. Seated in a back row near
          MARK and BEN. A number of seats in class are EMPTY.

<b>                         TEACHER

          Courtney Heuer?
          A girl raises her hand.
          Charlie, bored, idly checks out the class. Stops when he
          sees a tweaked-looking kid, ED, staring at him.
          EVIL ED is a slight, faintly punk-looking kid who's been
          picked on by bullies his whole life.
          He's hyper-intelligent, hyper-critical and... just hyper. And
          his binder is covered with COMIC BOOK STICKERS.

<b>                         TEACHER (CONT'D)

<b>                         (NOTHING)
</b>          Nick?
          Ed sees that he's caught Charlie's eye. Nods significantly
          at him. Like -- "you know and I know..."
          Charlie looks away. As if he didn't see him.

<b>          INT. CLARK COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL -- DAY
</b>
          Charlie, Mark and Ben move down the hall. Mark shows Charlie
          a picture on his phone. A woman posing seductively.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Miss Granada. Geometry.

<b>                         CHARLIE

<b>                         MARK
</b>          She's hard up, man. Equations
          don't keep you warm at night.
          They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and
          Ben. But Charlie's uncomfortable -- wants to bolt.

<b>                         BEN
</b>          I think "it's" going to talk to us.

<b>                         ED

          summer and his Jock Lobotomy.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          (to Ed/uncomfortable)
          What's the deal, man?

<b>                         ED
</b>          Alone.
          Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out
          laughing. Mark looks at Charlie.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Just the two of you. That's sweet.
          He can school you in the ways of
          geek-douchery.

<b>                         ED
</b>          It's important. "Brewster."
          The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into
          action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch
          with interest -- out of earshot.
          Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack.

<b>                         ED (CONT'D)
</b>          Adam's missing.
          Charlie's looking around, self-conscious.

<b>                         ED

          Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He
          starts to lose it, raises his voice--

<b>                         ED

          Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance.

           The sun has set behind the mountains. It's gloomy gray out,
          right before dark.
           Charlie and AMY park, climb out of her car with drinks from
           PLANET SMOOTHIE in hand. She's still in her track and field
          clothes. Looks tough.

          Jane stands over him, laughing at something he's said as he
          FIXES their sprinkler.
          PUSH IN as the guy looks up. This is JERRY. 30's. Handsome

          Jane sees Charlie and Amy approaching. And gaping.

          Hi. I'm Amy.
          He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She
          enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie.
          Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes
          manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand
          a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit.

           Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious.

          Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves
          off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          This is nuts.
          It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely
          righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's
          proper place. It's perfect.
          They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared.

          Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY

          Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's
          darker up here. Lights off.

          They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's
          parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty.
          Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery.
          Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him.
          The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY
          HIDING BEHIND the door. A LARGE MALE figure.
          Ed catches sight of the guy, and SPINS toward it, freaked.

          Ed thrusts his cross forward which knocks the door open,
          toppling A MOVIE CHARACTER STANDEE.
          A beat. Then Ed lets out a slightly manic laugh.

          Ed pulls a MAP out of his pocket. It has lots of red and
          black DOTS marked on it. He thrusts it at Charlie.

<b>                         ED
</b>          No, see, it's not just them. It
          started -- there was this thing on
          Channel 13, a lady escaped an
          attacker who tried to bite her.
          Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose
          circle around CHARLIE'S house.

          Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves

          He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate.

          A while later. It's REALLY DARK now.
          Ed, gripping his duffle bag nervously, skates down a
          residential street. Houses here are spaced far apart and the
          lights in many of them are off.
          Ed is anxious, watchful. He knows it's not safe. Every dark
          corner is potentially the end of him.
          A few cars pass. Something moves behind him. Footsteps
          GAINING. Ed abandons his skateboard and BOLTS.
          A hand SLAMS on his shoulder, spins him around. IT's MARK,
          Charlie's pal from school.

          Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels.
          The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has
          experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to
          shake Mark for a moment.
          Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS
          CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on
          the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Unbelievable.
          A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done.
          He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off.

          Ed trips over kid's toys and bikes as he runs to the house.

          Ed takes a ROCK and smashes the window over the kitchen sink.

          As he races through the empty rooms he pulls a stake from his

          long chain.
          JERRY's following, but barely breaking a sweat.
          Ed sees A SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the back. He fumbles with

          Ed's lifted WAY off his feet by the CHAIN, until he's choking
          on it, the cross directly under his neck.
          JERRY looks away as he SNAPS the chain off Ed and HURLS the
          cross into the neighbor's POOL.
          Ed falls to the ground, watches the cross sink in despair.
          Jerry's standing over him. Smiles a little. We get just a
          flash -- he suddenly has MORE TEETH, sharper, in rows. It's
          chilling.

<b>                         JERRY

<b>                         ED
</b>          We'll see, man. I know my shit.
          But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with
          actual sympathy.

<b>                         JERRY

          Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on.

          Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a
          step in. Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less
          conviction.

</b>          Rick! Charlie's here!

<b>                         (TO CHARLIE)
</b>          Look at you. So handsome!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Oh, I -- you don't have to--
           Now RICK, Ed's dad comes into the room. Shakes his hand.

<b>                         RICK
</b>          Ed said you'd sprouted. And
          you're, the--
          Rick awkwardly gestures around his face.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Cleared up. Yes sir--

<b>                         VICTORIA
</b>          Ed will be so sorry he missed you,
          But -- you should both be in school
          now, shouldn't you?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          He's not here? Did you see him
          today?

<b>                         RICK
</b>          He's usually up and out early.
          Everything okay?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          No, sure. We're working on a class
          project. I guess we crossed paths.

<b>                         VICTORIA
</b>          I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed,
          he'd be mad that I said so, but he
          talks about you all the time.
          This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Yeah. That's... He's great.

<b>                         (THEN)

          upstairs? Ed has a book we need.

</b>          Of course. Make yourself at home.
          Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick --
          "that's good!" They're both pleased.

<b>          INT. ED'S ROOM -- DAY
</b>
          Ed's room is a shrine to comic books, horror and fantasy
          movies.
          There's an art table where Ed has been working on some
          illustrations for a noir-style graphic novel. Charlie stops
          and looks at them. They're fantastic.
          He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few
          pictures of Ed, Charlie and Adam when they were friends.

<b>          CLOSE ON A PHOTO
</b>          Charlie and Ed, arms around each other. Charlie is shorter
          and thinner -- with really bad acne. Not cute. WAY not.

<b>                         ON CHARLIE
</b>          Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees--
          PETER VINCENT'S "FRIGHT NIGHT" POSTER on a wall. Charlie
          takes it in, laughs a little.
          Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's
          investigation of Jerry. Maps, news reports, vampire lore
          printed off the internet, books, etc.
          If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more
          of Ed's fictional world.
          Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head.
          It's all a fantasy -- nothing more.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          This is crazy.
          He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on --
          and one file stands out. "THE JERRY DIARIES."
          Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds
          a bunch of Quicktime files.
          He opens one. Stops.

          It's dark as Charlie comes home. He looks warily at Jerry's
          house as he searches for his keys.
          BAM -- he walks right into JERRY.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Hey guy.
          Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed
          thought? Impossible, but...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Hey. Guy.

          They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the
          kitchen.

<b>                         CHARLIE

</b>          Let me see what Mom's got. She's
          kind of a "light domestic".. .mom.
          Charlie steps inside. Pointedly DOESN'T ask Jerry to enter.
          Charlie intentionally leaves the door open, moves to the
          refrigerator. But keeps his eyes on Jerry. If he steps in,
          uninvited, Ed's theory is blown.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Nice kitchen. Same floor plan as
          my place, huh?
          Jerry leans against the door jamb -- BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE
          THRESHOLD. Charlie observes this. Holy shit.
          Charlie and Jerry MEET EYES. Then a cold smile creeps over
          Jerry's face.
          Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his
          hand -- it hits the ground, explodes.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Fuck!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          No! No. Thanks. I'll get it.
          Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly
          certain. He's been made.
          Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the
          doorway with the remaining beers.
          Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          There you go. Uh...party down.
          Jerry watches him, intense. His tone shifts -- cocky and
          intimidating. A threat disguised as "guy talk."

          Charlie bursts into his room, freaked out -- races to the
          window.
          His room is free of all geekery. Now it's all sports and
          sneakerhead stuff.
          AMY's there -- on his bed and surrounded by school books.
          She's reading Wuthering Heights.

          Charlie breaks away from the window. It's an effort. His
          focus is still half there, even as he tries to talk to Amy.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Sorry. You okay? Everything okay?
          He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Like us, you mean.
          Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          A beat. Charlie's torn -- he should go after her. But
          Doris's muted LAUGH from the other house draws his attention.
          He looks again at Jerry's house. He can see faint shadows
          moving behind the windows in the house, like ghosts.
           Charlie's conflicted, freaked -- what can he do? He picks up
          the phone. Dials 911. Then thinks better of it. Hangs up.
          Finally -- he stops at the window, eyes on JERRY'S PLACE.
          Listening and watching intently. Keeping sentry.

          Later. Charlie's fallen asleep in a chair by the window.
          He's startled awake by a woman's SCREAMS. They sound like
          they are coming from Jerry's.
          But are they screams of pleasure or pain?
          Charlie looks out the window. Jerry's house is dark. It's
          all quiet. Charlie looks at the clock. tam.
          Charlie sits back on his bed. Was it a dream? Then Charlie
          hears A MOTOR START. Charlie goes back to the window.
          Jerry's TRUCK starts and Jerry drives off.
          Off Charlie, unsettled.

          happens.

          Charlie moves through the first story of the house. He's
          cautious, on edge.
          At first the place seems totally unremarkable. A typical
          "guy pad". Lots of inexpensive furniture, bad art, a salt
          water fish tank...
          At every turn, Charlie expects something or someone to jump
          out at him. It's unbearably tense.

<b>          INT. JERRY'S HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT

          Charlie looks upstairs. Moves through a plain white hallway,
          finds an open door that leads to Jerry's office, where he
          keeps an EXTENSIVE LIBRARY.
          On one wall hangs a TAPESTRY that looks very old, decorated
          with a strange INSIGNIA. Charlie takes a picture of it with
          his phone.

          Charlie goes into Jerry's bedroom - opens his closet. Sees a
          variety of UNIFORMS. Cop, gas man, UPS, etc. Charlie
          reacts, chilled.
          Charlie stops. JERRY'S TRUCK is pulling into the driveway.
          Charlie's in a panic. Jerry will be inside any moment.

</b>
          Charlie pushes as far back into the closet as he can go.
          Leans against the back wall.
          The BACK OF THE CLOSET SWINGS OPEN and Charlie falls back
          into a HIDDEN HALLWAY.
          Charlie stands, stunned, see that the hallway is lined by
          small rooms on either side.
          It's clear that these are additions Jerry's added. Each room
          has a small rectangular WINDOW, so you can see in.
          Charlie reacts, sick. It looks like a prison. Despite the
          danger, he creeps over and looks in one of the rooms--

<b>          WHAM!!
</b>          A pale HAND slaps against the window. Charlie jumps.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Fuck! --
          DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks

          Charlie tugs on the door. Locked.
          He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The
          FRONT DOOR. And then -- JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching.

<b>                         DORIS
</b>          Oh... Oh no... Get me out of here!
          Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.

</b>          I'm -- I won't leave you--
          But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.

          moves behind the door.
          JERRY steps into the hallway, walks right by Charlie's hiding
          place. Pauses near him.
          The door is ajar. Was it that way before? Charlie holds his
          breath.
          Jerry moves to the CELL and retrieves DORIS's half-alive body
          from it.
          Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door.

<b>                          DORIS (CONT'D)

          The door to Doris's cell open. Charlie can see PART of
          Doris's body and face.
          Jerry is mostly obscured, bent over Doris -- holding her.
          Charlie watches helplessly, horrified.

<b>                         DORIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Please, please... don't kill me.
          Doris's body TENSES and starts to jerk, as Jerry TUGS AND
          RIPS AT IT SAVAGELY. It's clear he's FEEDING ON HER,
          although we can't see his face.
          Doris screams, then starts to cry. It's stark and REAL and
          terrifying.
          It seems to go on and on. Doris weakens, her head lolling to
          one side, her light fading.
          A small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement.
          In the position she's in, she is eye to eye with CHARLIE.
          She sees him, smiles weakly. Then mouths something -- too
          weak to make much sound.

<b>                          DORIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Cha... Cha...
          CHARLIE is petrified. Doris gets it -- smiles a little
          grimly, puts a finger to her lips. Silence.
          After what seems like an eternity, Jerry is satisfied. He
          tosses Doris aside and stands away from her.
          Charlie DUCKS behind the door as Jerry emerges and casually
          wipes a spot of blood from his mouth.

</b>          Then Jerry LOCKS DORIS back into her cell. Pockets the key
          and moves off toward the stairs. After a moment, he's gone.
          The sound of a TV starts in Jerry's living room. Something
          banal like "The Real Housewives of Orange County."
          Charlie knows this is his moment. With shaking hands, he
          retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the "HOW TO PICK A LOCK"
          screen.
          Charlie looks through the window in Doris's cell. She's
          breathing -- alive.
          Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a tiny
          screwdriver on the lock.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Please... Please...
          The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies
          himself. Tries again.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)

          The tension is unbearable. Charlie can hear JERRY moving
          downstairs.

</b>          The lock slides open. Charlie breathes with relief. Then he
          grabs Doris and BOLTS.
          Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerry's
          feeding, but he manages to stay on his feet.
          He pushes Doris ahead of him, to a BACK STAIRCASE.
          His PHONE drops out of his pocket, he has to double back --
          every moment counts. Doris's barely aware of what's
          happening, let alone where she is.

          A moment later. Charlie and Doris emerge downstairs, near
          the entry hall. They can see the front door -- and hear
          Jerry moving in another room.
          Charlie looks around, trying to get oriented.
          JERRY emerges -- almost sees them. Charlie ducks into a
          hiding spot and grabs Doris, covering her mouth.

          Charlie covers his writing and closes his computer screen.
          He looks like hell. Disheveled, sleep deprived, tense.

          Peter lives in a two story penthouse at the top of one of the
          casino hotels that he works in. It's lavish, floor to
          ceiling windows, etc.
          Still, goth influence reigns. The decor is tacky Haunted
          Mansion all the way.
          Charlie is shown into the "museum" by Peter's ASSISTANT,

          Charlie is genuinely impressed. The geek in him can't help
          it. Peter enters, talks to Arthur--

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Midori me.
          Arthur pours Peter a green drink as Peter pulls off his black
          wig (bandana attached) and peels off a nude body shirt that
          has a bunch of TATTOOS printed on it.
          He steps out of his boots, with three-inch LIFTS. Collapses
          into an arm chair. He's just another balding, middle-aged
          guy with bad eyes.
          Peter downs his drink. Arthur hands him the bottle. Peter
          looks at Charlie.
          In truth, Peter's isolated himself to the point that he
          actually welcomes a visitor -- though he'd never admit it.

          religious pictures, etc.
          Charlie LOOKS at the clock -- night coming too quickly. He's

          Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it.
          She CLIPS Charlie's dirt bike -- pushing it onto the sidewalk
          as she takes off.
          Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into
          an arriving FIRE ENGINE! Charlie, Amy and Jane SCREAM!!
          They narrowly avoid a head-on collision with a FIRE TRUCK.

          They are racing away when the DIRT BIKE COMES CRASHING
          THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW of the car, nearly taking Amy's head
          off.

          wildly in the back seat.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Amy!
          Amy's hair gets caught in the spokes - it's horrible as it
          YANKS part of her hair out.
          Charlie grabs her away from the bike -- she falls into his
          arms, crying as JERRY's BIG PICKUP appears in the rear
          windshield.

          Unlike the planned community of Shadow Hills -- now we can
          see we're surrounded by great expanses of empty DESERT.
          JERRY'S TRUCK SMASHES REPEATEDLY into JANE'S.

          Charlie's looking around as they speed down the highway, in
          the rearview. NO JERRY anywhere.

          Everybody looks UP. The roof of the car.
          BAM! Jerry's hand SHOOTS up through the FLOORBOARD under
          Jane's feet.
          Jane and Amy SCREAM!

          He's TEARING THROUGH METAL from the undercarriage of the car,
          where he's clinging -- face up.
          The more he rips away -- the more he reveals his face.
          His veins and eyes are BLACK. His nose snout-like. And his
          fangs emerge from lethal rows of jagged teeth, like a SHARK.
          It's shocking, horrible.

<b>          ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR

          at his clothes and flesh.
          He reaches through the hole he's made and SLAMS his fist down
          on the FLOOR BREAK. The car SCREECHES to a sudden halt.
          ON CHARLIE, AMY and JANE
          Screaming even after the car has stopped. Then -- BAM!! The
          car is REAR-ENDED by another vehicle. It's a MINIVAN.
          JANE's car is SLAMMED -- the back is a crush of glass and

          They back off.
          Charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it
          as he walks toward Jerry. Jerry keeps his distance, taunting

          Ding, ding, ding -- the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the
          warning bell rings over and over...
          CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry,
          backing him off.

          Jerry LUNGES for Charlie, but he DIVES for the family man's
          open car door.
          But Jerry's on him -- hands BURNING as he rips the cross from
          Charlie and shatters it with his hand.
          Then he TOSSES Charlie, who flies and hits JANE'S CAR, then
          crumples to the ground.
          Jerry gets Charlie around the neck -- holds a sharp,
          splintered end of the broken cross against Charlie's chest.
          The wood still burns into Jerry's hand, but Jerry holds on.

          Jerry positions the "stake" right over Charlie's heart.
          Charlie winces. Terrified and overpowered.

          Jerry's about to plunge the STAKE through Charlie's heart
          when a THICK WOOD STAKE comes through Jerry's SHOULDER.
          Jerry HOWLS, falls off Charlie and we see that he's been
          staked by the business end of a REAL ESTATE SIGN.
          JANE stands over them, quaking with fear and adrenaline.

          A door to a STAIRWELL opens, Jerry steps into a hall. He
          looks healthy again. Robust.
          He wipes a small smear of blood from his mouth.

          AMY AND CHARLIE hold their breath as ED looks around the

          Ed SHOVES the cabinet off him with his good hand, stands.
          Charlie and Ed face off.

          Ed lashes out, slicing CHARLIE on the arm with his SHARP
          NAILS. Charlie yells, but holds his ground.

          Charlie takes a swing with the AXE. Ed starts BOUNDING
          around the room, avoiding Charlie's swings as he clings to
          walls and, impossibly, THE CEILING.

          Charlie swings and swings, but Ed is too fast for him.
          Finally, Charlie connects with ED'S NECK. Blood flies,
          Charlie can't look -- anguished.

          horrible.
          Ed SLASHES Charlie again with his claw-like nails. Charlie

          She empties the GUN into JERRY anyway. It knocks him back,

          approaching with A SPIKED MACE. Charlie DUCKS and AMY
          smashes ED in the head. Hard.
          Charlie grabs a long, sharp piece of the shattered wooden
          cabinet.
          Ed is on the ground. Moaning, laughing. Charlie has his

          Ed's hideous features seem to dissolve. For a brief moment --
          he looks like himself again.

          Then he BURNS UP FROM THE INSIDE OUT.
          Charlie's paralyzed -- in a world of hurt.

          They slow Jerry down enough to get slightly ahead.

          They find themselves ON THE FLOOR of a HARD ROCK TYPE CASINO,
          which is on the bottom of the building where Peter lives.
          Amy slows as they fold into the crowds. Relieved.

          Now Charlie sees JERRY some distance behind them now, moving
          toward them in the crowd. They meet eyes.
          Charlie grabs Amy, scans for someplace to hide. He spots a
          nightclub -- "REFLECTIONS".
          The outside walls are all mirrored, like a brightly lit
          diamond.

<b>                         ON JERRY

          The inside of the club is made up of MIRRORS AND WINDOWS.
          The dance floor is PACKED. All writhing bodies and sweaty
          abandon.
          It's dizzying, disorienting.
          Charlie sees JERRY enter, look around for them. The best bet
          to get lost is to dive into the crowd.
          Charlie leads Amy through the throngs of people -- the
          different levels of the club are like a maze. Glass
          staircases lead to mirrored balconies...
          A hopped-up DJ climbs up on a balcony, starts throwing t-
          shirts into the crowd.

<b>                         DJ

          dance with him. He pushes past her.

          Charlie can't see Amy, instead sees HIMSELF over and over
          again in a series of mirrors -- the infinity effect.
          It's dizzying, disorienting.
          THEN HE SEES JERRY, a shark, moving in and out of the crowd,
          disappearing behind mirrored columns, reemerging...
          Charlie also sees that JERRY DOESN'T REFLECT in the mirrors
          around them. Instead the crowd parts as if by magic.
          Jerry's heading straight toward--

<b>                         AMY

          Peter backs away as Charlie moves in.
          Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a
          decade in one night.

          Charlie sits by Jane's bedside. She's still comatose.
          We move closer and see that Charlie's drawing a MAP OF
          JERRY'S HOUSE on some scrap paper -- laying it out from
          memory as best he can.
          He GLANCES at the clock as it ticks toward DA
          As Charlie plots, he talks to Jane -- his silent confidante.

          He stops, contemplates his mother for a moment -- regretful.

          Charlie buys FIREPROOF CLOTHING, a small open-flame lighter,
          and a SPRAY CANISTER like the kind an exterminator uses.
          The guy at the counter looks Charlie up and down. Charlie
          takes this in. Finally, Charlie's like -- fuck it.

          CHARLIE stands on the front lawn, contemplating the houses.
          He wears fireproof clothes, has stakes and crosses strapped
          to him, holsters made out of duct-tape...
          Slung over his shoulder is the spray canister. And he holds
          a crowbar in a free hand. He looks like something out of one
          of Ed's graphic novels.
          Before he enters, Charlie DOUSES HIMSELF IN HOLY WATER.

          AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's
          not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her.

          THUD! Charlie and Peter land painfully on a dirt floor.

<b>                         PETER
</b>          Ow, crap...
          They look around -- eyes adjusting. There's barely any
          light.
          They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt
          and the main story of the house is held up by numerous

<b>          SUPPORT POSTS.
</b>          At the far end of the basement there is a door that leads to
          another room/storage area.

          A MOUND of dirt. Like a grave.
          Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him. They whisper:

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          You uncover him. I'll light him
          up, then stake him.
          Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face.
          Peter looks at him.

          They're standing over the grave now. Both nervous.
          Charlie nods to Peter. Peter does his best to hold the
          shotgun on the grave as he pushes the dirt aside with his
          free hand. He's shaking.

          In the dirt behind CHARLIE are MORE GRAVES. Eight or ten at

          Charlie reacts, stunned.
          Peter moves to another grave, uncovers another sleeping face.
          And then another. A hulking man, a suburban mom...
          Charlie uncovers another body. Stops, chilled.

          Great. Right. Save the Geometry--
          A SCREAM stops him. Amy. Charlie and Peter spin -- it's
          coming from behind the door to the other room. A beat.
          They're both petrified as they move toward the door.
          Peter readies the gun again. Charlie pulls a CROSS out along
          with the stake.
          They creep toward the door.

          Peter fires the shotgun, BLAM!

          Charlie reacts to the blast -- but sees that ST. MICHAEL'S
          STAKE has fallen from his hand and rolled to the edge of the
          grave.
          He cautiously moves to retrieve it...
          He stops as he sees A FIGURE emerge from the dark. AMY.
          Her clothes are torn now, a thin trickle of blood runs down
          her neck. She looks impossibly sexy. Her hair, her eyes,
          her lips -- all shining and full.
          Forgetting himself, he goes to her. Pulls her into his arms.

          thing holding him back.

          JERRY, backed by ADAM, MS. GRANADA and a handful of other

          Charlie gets his first look at AMY in full VAMPIRE glory.
          She's even more freaky looking than Jerry or Ed. Her face is
          nearly overtaken by a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp
          teeth. Her eyes are crazed and blood-red.
          It's gruesome and terrifying.
          Charlie sees THE STAKE at the lip of the hole. Dives for it.
          Amy's on him in a flash. She throws him to the ground. He's
          got the STAKE in hand. Ready to strike.

          on an army.

<b>                         CHARLIE

          Charlie stops. Swayed. Pained.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          Do it.

<b>          CLOSE ON CHARLIE

          He starts DIGGING.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          Charlie!
          But Charlie ignores him, determined. Pulls his MASK DOWN
          over his face again.

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)

<b>          108.

          Charlie falls back, PULLING JERRY with him into THE LIGHT
          Jerry BURSTS INTO FLAME -- but holds Charlie tight
          AMY and the other vamps start to claw their way OUT of the
          rubble.
          Charlie and Jerry fight -- nearly ENGULFED IN FLAMES now

<b>                         PETER (CONT'D)
</b>          Charlie!
          Peter gets up, painfully, moves to help.
          Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to battle.
          Finally, Jerry pulls Charlie down with him --rolls on the
          ground as they fight. Trying to put out the flames.
          Jerry starts to DISINTEGRATE -- he's about to EXPLODE into
          bits. Charlie's stake is now ON FIRE.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>
<b>          NO!
</b>          A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to
          burn away.

<b>          HE STAKES JERRY.
</b>          AMY suddenly SCREAMS - she's burning inside, DYING. Or so it
          seems. The vampire is being burned out of her.
          PETER cries out too, reacting less violently. But in pain.

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Still burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in
          his CHEST. Right through the heart.
          He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- faster and faster, just like
          Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre BLUR.
          For a moment -- Jerry's human form hangs in the air...

<b>                         JERRY
</b>          Blow me.

<b>          THEN HE BLOWS INTO A MILLION PIECES.

</b>          Charlie!
          She crawls into the grave. Cradles Charlie in her arms.

</b>          Charlie...
          Amy starts to cry. Peter looks on, concerned. Finally,
          Charlie opens his eyes. Says weakly...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Blow me? Seriously?
          Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing.

          We pull away, leaving this tableau...
          UNTIL ADAM, MS. GRANADA and the OTHER MEMBERS of the tribe
          emerge from the rubble. Disoriented, freaked.
          A beat.

<b>          MS. GRANADA

          Charlie, Amy, Jane and Peter are in Peter's penthouse. It's
          a glittering night, a spectacular view.

          She smiles at Peter, who also looks more together.
          She has a glass of wine -- he's drinking a COKE.

<b>                         JANE

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          I am so going to perform.
          Charlie KISSES her. It's intense, passionate. It's
          different, they're different. The childish part of them long
          gone.
          He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close.
          SOMETHING BEEPS, talks...

<b>                         VOICE

          Charlie follows PETER into the DINING ROOM, where a BAR CART
          is set up. Peter moves to it. Pours himself a Midori.

</b>          Yeah you do. So here's what I'm
          thinking. We faced the beast and
          we won. Can you imagine the

</b>
<b>                         PETER
</b>          Show up on film, yeah. But

          proof, catch something -- we could
          build a stage act around that, you
          wouldn't believe. We'd blow those
          Cirque bitches away!

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          An act? Seriously? What about

<b>                         ABOUT--
</b>          A CHILLING LAUGH interrupts them. Distant. Eerie. And
          somehow familiar.
          Peter nods to his COLLECTION CABINETS.

<b>          REFLECTION ON THE FLOOR-TO-CEILING WINDOW.
</b>          Just a wisp, a phantom. The face - is it ED? His features
          twisted in a grimace of fear and pain... It's CHILLING.
          Charlie's spooked. But he looks again and the face is gone.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)

<b>          113.

          room. Still on about his idea...

<b>          WE HOLD ON THEIR REFLECTION IN THE WINDOW
</b>
<b>          PETER (O.S.)
</b>          I'm serious, man. Do you know how
          much we could make? Think about
          how much people pay to see a tiger,
          or boobs, right? What if we had a
          tiger, boobs -- and a zombie!
          After they've gone we linger on the window. Is that Ed's
          eerie reflection again?, barely visible...

<b>          AS WE GO TO BLACK
