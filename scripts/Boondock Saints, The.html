<b>               INT.  GOTHIC CHURCH  10:00 A.M.  ST. PATRICK'S DAY
</b>
<b>               DOWNTOWN BOSTON
</b>
               As we open we see the inside of an enormous church. A young 
               looking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery 
               of the Lordâ€™s Prayer. In the back of the church, in the last 
               pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor.

               They do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace 
               when told, but they pray. They grip and rub their rosaries. 
               They mutter their words in Latin.

               CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in 
               thick waist length navy P-coats, worn leather boots and the 
               hungry clothes of the poor. The boys heads are shaved and 
               they have facial hair.

                              priest)
                         Thank you Father Macklepenny, for 
                         coming all the way across town to be 
                         our guest speaker today. I hope you 
                         found our little parish to your 
                         liking.

               Macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular 
               priests of the church. The MacManus brothers suddenly stand, 
               as all others remain seated. Each church goer between them 
               and the aisle shifts his/her position to allow the boys 
               passage, as if on command. The two turn and begin to stride 
               for the alter, eyes down, determined.

</b>                              (thick Irish accent)
                         They've never been like anyone else. 
                         From the moment they were born, of 
                         the same womb, on the same day, they 
                         just had their own way, my boys did. 
                         And I always knew that one day they 
                         would do something of true greatness. 
                         I just never expected they would 
                         bring about such a... such a 
                         reckoning.

               The MacManus brothers are fraternal twins. As Annabelle 
               MacManus speaks, Macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the 
               congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks 
               this out of the ordinary.

               The monsignor begins his sermon. Macklepenny rises to stop 
               the boys from this disgraceful disturbance.

               The elder clergyman finds Macklepenny's arm, keeping him 
               seated while shaking his head. Macklepenny's confusion gives 
               way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, 
               brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous 
               crucifix.

               They both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of Christ. 
               They rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head 
               back down the aisle for the front door. They stop at the 
               rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon.

                         ...and I am reminded of this holy 
                         day of the sad story of Kitty 
                         Geneviese. This poor soul cried out 
                         time and time again for help but no 
                         person answered her calls. Though 
                         many saw, not one so much as called. 
                         Her assailant wiped the bloody knife 
                         off on her lifeless little body. 
                         They watched as he simply walked 
                         away. Nobody wanted to get involved. 
                         Nobody wanted to take a stand... We 
                         must fear evil men and deal with 
                         them accordingly but what we must 
                         truly guard against, what we must 
                         fear most
                              (beat)
                         Is the indifference of good men.

               The MacManuses turn and walk out the door.

</b>
               The boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of 
               the steps to light up their cigarettes. They both roll their 
               cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their 
               lips. In this unique way they light up, seemingly oblivious 
               to their synchronicity and mimic.

                         I do believe the Monsignor finally 
                         got a point.

               They leave.

               Murphy, wearing a white blood soaked smock and apron stands 
               around the corner of the entrance to the loading dock. He 
               grips a gigantic, bloody slab of meat and smirks. Connor 
               flips his cigarette out the loading dock and passes his 
               brother's hiding place. He notices the workers have stopped, 
               and are looking at him.

               Murphy slaps Connor square in the face with the bloody slab.

               Connor's face is caked with blood as he stands stunned. He 
               then leaps on Murphy, sending him into a pile of nearby 
               hamburger. He grabs a large cow tongue from a nearby heap 
               and begins slapping Murphy in the face with it as they both 
               laugh and the workers cheer.

               Their boss, McGERKIN approaches with a very large woman.

               Her head is clean-shaven. The two are still laughing, out of 
               breath, they turn.

               Rozengurtle and Connor stand in front of a bunch of co-workers 
               who are cutting meat as it goes by on assembly.

                         from? In the early 1900's it was 
                         legal for men to beat their wives as 
                         long as they used a stick no wider 
                         than their thumb.

               Connor holds up his thumb and stares at it.

                         Rule of wrist.

               She returns an icy stare. He hands her the knife. The co-
               workers all seem wary of Roz.

               Murphy stands on one side of Roz, Connor on the other, 
               surrounded by a tight group of workers. Everyone is within 
               ear shot of one another, cutting meat as it goes by. Knowing 
               glances are shared by everyone. It is an uncomfortable mood.

               Everyone burst out laughing. Rozengurtle jabs a knife in a 
               piece of meat and turns to Connor. She pushes him and starts 
               walking toward him. He starts backing up, laughing.

               Rozengurtle begins to turn, raising her fist to Murphy.

               Murphy winds up and punches her square in the face. She lands 
               on her back. The on-lookers are stunned as he walks over and 
               stands above her.

               The brothers get to the top of the stairs. Connor is hunched 
               over and moving slowly. Murphy giggles.

               Connor flicks his cigarette butt out the large open loading 
               doors at the end of the hall. The red brick buildings stretch 
               down the alley both ways. The glowing butt falls to a filthy 
               resting place, directly next to a dented green dumpster with 
               half the paint job scraped off.

               This is a decrepit, illegal loft. The boys enter, hang their 
               rosaries by the door and begin taking off their clothes.

               Connor sits naked on the couch and gently places a bag of 
               ice on his crotch. Murphy stands naked in the open quantity 
               shower. Murphy turns on the water and sticks his hand in the 
               stream.

               Connor, still seated, cracks open a Guinness and sips it 
               lovingly. The phone rings.

               Murphy sees the concern in Connor's eyes and takes a step 
               closer.

                         and make me proud, but he was wrong

               Connor and Murphy are both screaming in panic.

<b>               EXT. ANNABELLE MACMANUS' BACK STOOP  NIGHT

               Mom stands on the back stoop holding the door ajar with her 
               hip. She holds the phone receiver up in her left hand and 
               the gun directly next to it, in her right. She squeezes off 
               a loud shot toward the heavens.

<b>               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY EVENING
</b>
               As soon as the deafening sound pierces through the receiver, 
               Connor instinctively jumps up to a standing position. The 
               bag of ice bursts as it hits the floor and spreads across 
               it. He throws the receiver and covers his ears with both 
               hands.

               The phone then falls to the ground, skipping through the 
               cubes as the boys dive for it screaming. The two naked, 
               hysterical boys fumble for the phone, flailing on their 
               stomachs in the field of ice. They finally catch it and both 
               put their ears to the receiver in panic. As they scream MA 
               intermittently, the pauses get longer and longer.

               Mom's got her hand covering her mouth, face red from holding

               take it no longer and she bursts out with hearty guffaws.

<b>               EXT. AN ALLEY  MORNING
</b>
               PAUL SMECKER, F.B.I. agent, is lead by the Boston Chief of 
               Police through a jungle of ravenous reporters, police lines 
               and uniformed officers. He is impeccably dressed in a deep 
               red suit. He is smiling, confident as he walks. He is a very 
               good-looking, slender man.

               He looks intently, for a moment, at four uniformed officers.

               They approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green 
               dumpster with half the paint job scraped off.

               One man, IVAN CHECKOV, lays on his stomach, closer to the 
               dumpster than the other. The ass of his pants has been burnt 
               out and a large cotton bandage is in its place.

               The other, VLADDY, has a blood soaked bandage around his 
               head and is on his stomach as well. There are hundreds of 
               pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere. Three plain-
               clothed homicide detectives, DUFFY, DOLLY and GREENLY hover 
               close to the bodies. Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an 
               obvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took 
               place.

               The chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him 
               back with a smile. The two wait and watch in a position, 
               where the unsuspecting detectives have their backs to them.

                         the shit out of each other. This guy

                         Picks up an old kitchen sink that 
                         some one threw out and crushes this

                              (Checkov)
                         With it. All right, so it makes a 
                         big bang and alerts their friend, 
                         who's standin' look out around the 
                         corner. So he comes over and gets 
                         into it with this guy, 
                              (Vladdy)
                         He's angry at him, right? They get 
                         into an altercation in which the 
                         look out guy crushes this guy by 
                         jumpin on him. And look at the damage 
                         here.
                              (Vladdy)
                         I mean this guy's fuckin' hamburger 
                         man. His spine is crushed. He's all 
                         twisted and shit. That guy had to be 
                         one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400 
                         pounds, fuckin huge.

               Smecker listens.

               The Chief is embarrassed.

                         two don't even know the huge guy. 
                         They're just staggerin' home from a 
                         bar this morning, still all fucked 
                         up from St. Patty's last night. So 
                         they figure they'll take a short cut 
                         down the alley and this big mother 
                         fucker, he's just waitin'. And what 
                         could be more perfect for strong arm 
                         robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged 
                         up. They're already injured for Christ 
                         sakes. He takes a blunt object and 
                         whacks the guy with the bandage on 
                         his head, right? Cause he's smart. 
                         He knows the guy with the bandage on 
                         his ass, he ain't going nowhere. 
                         Matter of fact, this guy's probably 
                         helping his friend with the rectal 
                         problem along. They're limping around 
                         like a couple of decrepit old broads. 
                         So once this guy's out of the picture

                         this poor asshole, he tries to run. 
                         But look how far he gets fore the 
                         huge bastard catches up with him. 
                         Only a few yards. And what does he 
                         do? He gets creative. He picks up a 
                         sink and crushes the poor mother-
                         fucker. Then, he ain't done yet. He 
                         comes over here, jumps on this guy's 
                         back and crushes him to death.
                              (Vladdy)
                         He steals their shit and beats it!

                         And look at this print...

               Greenly points out a large foot print on Vladdy's back.

               Some detectives nod in agreement. Smecker chuckles as he 
               shakes his head.

               Smecker saunters up to Greely and pulls his I.D. out of the 
               breast pocket of his sport coat and lets it hang. The large, 
               light blue letters, F.B.I. can be easily seen.

               All the detectives seem disgruntled and look to the Chief

               storms off the scene, upset. Smecker turns his back on 
               everyone and puts earphones in. He reaches down and hits 
               play. The choir song "Agnus dei" overtakes. He begins to 
               investigate. He kneels at the bodies for a moment then stares 
               at the opposite brick wall. He picks up a piece of porcelain 
               and scrapes it with his thumb.

               He quickly cocks his head toward the sky and begins to chuckle 
               as he says Jesus Christ, under his breath. He brushes some 
               paraffin on each of the dead men's hands. Duffy and Dolly 
               watch defiantly. They start to smile at one another as they 
               collectively realize his homosexuality. He is slightly 
               effeminate buy not overly fey.

               A potent song takes our ears as The MacManus brothers sit in 
               the E.R. They have already received care. Their faces are 
               beaten and there are bandages and dried blood in various 
               spots. Connor's injuries exceed Murphy's. They are both clad 
               in only their leather boots, boxer shorts and worn out old 
               bathrobes.

               Young kids wait for medical attention, as their knife wounds 
               bleed. Two nuns in the corner console a third, whose robes 
               are ripped and face is beaten. A woman toward the end of the 
               hall is so badly beaten she is unrecognizable.

               As the song builds to a more harrowing chorus, a man enters.

               His clothes suggest he's a pimp. He is not injured. He looks 
               around as he stands, perturbed, at the end of the hall.

               He reaches over and grabs the beat up woman by the hair and 
               begins to drag her out. She is kicking and screaming from 
               the floor, grabbing at his wrists as he hauls her away.

               (Slo-mo) The boys, instantly furious, stand and begin to go 
               toward the action, but Connor's legs give out on him and he 
               falls to the floor. Connor, still trying to go after the 
               pimp, crawls towards him. Murphy helps his brother to his 
               chair and hold him tight.

               The brothers quietly enter in the back of the room. All the

               with coffee for them. He shakes their hands and says he really

               ice at them. DAVID DELLA ROCCO makes his way through the 
               crowd. Rocco is thirty-two years old. He has shoulder-length, 
               dark hair and a full beard and mustache that wrap around his 
               big smile. He charges up to the bar and yells to Doc.

               This sends everyone even further into laughter. Doc throws 
               two huge fists full of ice at him. He backs away laughing.

               The boys get up off the floor and have a huge group hug with 
               Rocco as they all scream each others names.

               subtitles.

                         go, Ivan."

               Checkov is completely taken aback. All the Irish are fairly 
               impressed as well.

               They clink the glasses together, throw back the Hennessey, 
               ball up the thick glasses in their fists, drop to one knee 
               and both deliver a devastating blow to each of Checkov's 
               quads. Murphy on the left, Connor on the right. He's down 
               for the count, writhing on the floor.

               The boy's each take a Russian guy and start fighting as the 
               others start kicking and spitting on Checkov. This is a bar 
               brawl, lots of punches don't connect. Connor dismantles his 
               man quickly. Murphy is still fighting as all the Irish try 
               to jump in and help Murphy but Connor goes into psycho mode, 
               pushing them all back.

                         fuck he's doing!

               They all back off and start to cheer him on. Murphy and Vladdy 
               are ripping each other apart. Vladdy backs him against a 
               wall and pulls back, exhausted, for one good punch. Murphy 
               reaches up behind his head with both hands and pulls two 
               bottles of wine from a wall rack. He swings them toward each 
               other with Vladdy's head as the mid-point. The bottles 
               haphazardly connect, one on each side of his head. He crumples 
               to the ground in an explosion of glass and wine.

               There is shock and silence.

               They have Ivan Checkov tied down to the bar on his stomach.

               Connor stands with an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips 
               next to Ivan. He pours Hennessey all over Checkov's buttocks.

               They all cheer. Ivan's face is battered as Rocco wakes and 
               approaches. He punches Checkov in the face in complete rage.

               Two friends subdue him as all chuckle.

                         this piece of shit is about to be 
                         initiated.

               As they cheer, Connor lights up his smoke and tosses the 
               match on Ivan's butt.

               The Hennessey is instantly ablaze and Checkov is screaming 
               and wiggling in horror. Some just stand there stunned, but 
               most of the remaining onlookers leap to Ivan's aid. They 
               furiously pat him out and turn on Connor.

<b>               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY NEXT MORNING
</b>
               Connor and Murphy, fairly beat up, sit up on their beds.

               They wear tattered bathrobes and boxer shorts. They put their 
               feet down into their leather boots. The boys examine the 
               extent of one another's injuries and reflect on their 
               hangovers. They both laugh and grab their heads in pain.

               Boom! The door breaks open and in hobbles Checkov and Vladdy, 
               guns drawn. Checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants 
               is burnt out. A bulky bandage covers his buttocks. Vladdy 
               has a large bandage around his head. The boys stand in 
               surprise.

               Ivan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun, sending 
               blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. Murphy 
               helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his 
               knees by Vladdy. Ivan positions Connor on his knees before 
               the toilet, which is open to the room. Checkov puts his foot 
               on Connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff 
               him to the old toilet. So now Connor is bleeding and hugging 
               the commode with his hands cuffed behind the bowl base.

<b>                                     CHECKOV

                         not... I'm going to kill your brother. 
                         I'm going to take him down to the 
                         dumpster and I'm going to shoot him 
                         in the head. Then I'm going to throw 
                         his dead body in the garbage.
                              (looks at this watch)
                         Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes, 
                         gotta go.

               Checkov walks towards the door and says "let's go" to Vladdy.

                         are fuckin' pussies!

               Vladdy pulls him to his feet and leads him away following 
               Checkov.

               Connor, blood running from his face, listens to absolute 
               silence for just a moment. Suddenly his face reads the gravity 
               of the situation. In a split second he turns into an animal. 
               He's yelling, pulling, tugging and growling.

               His body is a whirlwind of motion. The skin on his wrists 
               bleeds profusely.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING
</b>
               Vladdy and Checkov lead Murphy out back into the alley.

               Murphy is on his knees next to the dumpster. Checkov has his 
               gun to the boy's head. He acts like he's going to pull the 
               trigger, but he stops. Vladdy is standing twenty feet away 
               with his back to them keeping a look out, gun in hand.

<b>               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT.  MORNING
</b>
               Connor becomes so venomous, that he pulls the entire toilet 
               right out of the floor.

<b>               INT. TO EXT.  MACMANUS' TENEMENT  LOADING DOORS  MORNING
</b>
               (slo-mo) Connor steps out onto the sill of the huge, open 
               loading doors. He is five stories up. His muscles ripple 
               with the weight of the toilet. His face is barbaric.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING
</b>
               From his kneeling position, Murphy can see his brother perched 
               50 feet overhead. He does not let his face betray him.

<b>                                     CHECKOV
</b>                         I hope your conscience is clear, 
                         Irishman.

<b>               EXT. MACMANUS' TENEMENT  LOADING DOORS  MORNING
</b>
               (slo-mo) Connor bends his knees and heaves the toilet upward 
               and swings one arm directly beneath it. He is no longer 
               tethered around the basin. He holds it at a cocked angle.

               The heavy porcelain tank cover slips off the toilet.

               He tosses the toilet in a left and outwardly trajectory, 
               then he jumps off the sill to the right. He is sailing through 
               the air about twenty feet behind, and to the right of the 
               toilet, cuffed hands above his head, robe up like a cape 
               behind him. Murphy screams

<b>               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING
</b>
               (slo-mo) Checkov begins to laugh heartily. The tank top lands 
               pristinely on a garbage bag just behind Murphy. Ivan's look 
               turns to one of terror. Bam! He is crushed by the toilet. 
               Boom! His gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near 
               the bottom. Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns 
               to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits.

               Connor lands squarely on Vladdy's back. His gun discharges 
               firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is 
               savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and 
               hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious.

               Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence.

               He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks 
               his vital signs. He seems okay. Vladdy, still alive, slowly 
               crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet 
               casing. Murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs 
               the man to death with two hard and fast blows, then throws 
               it up and behind him. It lands in the dumpster with a 
               resonating boom.

               Murphy quickly takes everything from the scene; guns, money, 
               wallets, watches and a pager. He shoves it in a garbage bag 
               and throws Connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley.

               The press is ablaze with questions. Smecker turns and walks 
               down the precinct steps, passing Rocco, who carries a bunch 
               of folded clothes, and heads for the police station. Smecker 
               glances in Rocco's direction, barely noticing the man who 
               has already passed him.

               Rocco approaches the wide open cell as Chaffey and Mitchell 
               play cards with the brothers. Happy to see each other the 
               boys and Rocco embrace. He hands them their clothes.

<b>               INT. MACMANUS' CELL  NIGHT
</b>
               The boys are in a tight cell with a bed on each side. They 
               are in their own clothes now. The brothers are fast asleep.

               Suddenly, they lurch forward, throwing their chests out, 
               lips tight, still asleep.

               An officer turns on the faucet of a sink and begins to wash 
               his hands. We go down to the pipes beneath the porcelain 
               basin. An old leak seeps water through a crack in the floor.

<b>               INT. MACMANUS' CELL  NIGHT
</b>
               A water leak starts on the ceiling. It drips faster and 
               faster. The water begins to follow a water damaged crack 
               along the ceiling. It slowly spreads in two directions.

               The brothers struggle for air in their sleep. Then slowly, 
               and at the same time, they each reach up one arm apiece and 
               simultaneously curl their hands as if grabbing something.

               Their straining faces are brought from darkness to light as 
               they sit up quickly, face to the ceiling.

               Their eyes open wide and they each draw their first breath 
               as drops of the creeping water land on their foreheads.

               They look at each other across the room in shock as the drips 
               of water still fall between them.

               Duffy hands Murphy a jelly donut and a cup of coffee as Dolly 
               spreads a copy of the Boston Globe in front of Murphy. The 
               headlines read "The Saints of South Boston." All the 
               detectives chuckle as Murphy is momentarily absorbed. He 
               takes the paper.

               Connor cradles the receiver of a pay phone between his cheek 
               and shoulder. He pockets the pager. As the phone rings, he 
               readies his pen. The other end of the line picks up and a 
               thick Russian accent instantly begins speaking. Connor 
               responds by speaking a few words in Russian before he realizes 
               it's a recorded message. He begins writing. He hangs up the

               Rocco, still sporting a shiner, enters an office. There are 
               papers everywhere and it is a cluttered mess of telephones, 
               filing cabinets, lamps and chairs. Rocco clutches a brown 
               paper bag as if it is made of gold. POPPA JOE YAKAVETTA, 
               Rocco's boss, is on the phone. He is in his late forties.

               He's always comfortably dressed; sleeves rolled up, collar 
               unbuttoned.

               VINCENZO LIPAZZI swaggers across the office to Rocco. He is 
               in his late thirties. He goes out of his way to look like 
               Elvis; open shirt, gold chains and medallions. He is 
               overweight and has a bouffant hairdo, accompanied by Elvis 
               shades. Vincenzo flips a half dollar in his hand constantly.

               Rocco and Vincenzo hate each other. Yakavetta talks on the 
               phone.

               Rocco obeys like an angry child. Vincenzo puts it in front 
               of Yakavetta. He sits on a filing cabinet and flips his coin. 
               Vincenzo giggles and whispers as he pokes fun at Rocco.

               The two of them resemble kids behind the teacher's back.

               try to look composed.

               As he speaks he unwraps the wax paper in the bag. Rocco looks 
               over his shoulder. It's a sandwich. He's embarrassed.

</b>
               Paul Smecker lies in bed with his young lover, Reuben (mid-
               twenties). He has an innocent, feminine look and a GQ air 
               about him. The two have just had sex and Reuben is far more 
               excited about it than Smecker.

               Reuben pants and gestures that it was a wonderful experience.

               Smecker watches TV.

               Reuben reaches over and affectionately places a hand on 
               Smecker's chest. Paul tosses it off with indifference.

               Reuben has a pouty look. The phone rings.

                              (pause)
                         Room number.

               Reuben throws an arm over Smecker's abdomen and places his 
               head on Paul's bare chest as if to now force affection.

               He is visibly miffed with Reuben's sudden display. He tries 
               to pull the arm away but Reuben holds tight.

                         What's the body count?  

               Smecker is annoyed. He slaps Reuben semi-gently once on his 
               exposed cheek. Reuben closes his eyes and holds even tighter.

               He bites his lower lip in anger and smack Reuben again on 
               the same cheek, hard. Reuben jumps to a sitting position 
               holding his cheek. He is shocked and hurt.

               Smecker saunters down the hall, his usual confident smile.

               He is impeccably dressed in a brightly colored suit. Greenly 
               stands directly outside an open door at the hall's end. A 
               steady flow of detectives and forensics filter in and out.

               Smecker halts before Greenly and looks straight into his 
               eyes.

<b>               INT. PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT
</b>
               Smecker and Greenly walk into a large sunken living room 
               with high ceilings. There is a huge white shaped pit couch 
               in the center with seven dead bodies draped across it. All 
               the bodies have been turned so they are either seated or on 
               their backs and bright new pennies have been place in their 
               eyes. There is one corpse directly in the middle of the living 
               room, making eight. This victim (THE FAT MAN) is overweight 
               and is lying in debris made up of sheet rock and broken wood 
               which spreads thinly for a five foot radius around him.

               The victims' body positions are in a circle with the fat man 
               as the hub. Smecker is instantly engulfed. The regular 
               homicide detectives are on hand with their I.D.s hanging out 
               of their breast pockets. They see Smecker and back off.

               Duffy wears an especially loud tie. Smecker lights up a smoke. 
               He circles around and sees another body behind the couch, 
               which makes nine. The victim is on his back, with pennies 
               stuck in his eyes.

                         I'm sure the word you were looking 
                         for was symbolism. What's the 
                         symbolism there? Let me explain it 
                         to you. In Greek and Roman mythology 
                         when you died you would have to pay 
                         the toll to Charon, the boatman who 
                         ferried you across to the gates of 
                         judgment. This made sure the dead 
                         came to atone for what they did during 
                         their lives, Detective...

               Smecker looks at his I.D.

               Smecker is chain smoking. His clothes appear unkempt. His

               entered. He defiantly holds a cup of coffee but is too

                         one guy came in here and killed eight 
                         men with eight extremely well aimed

                         Had to be at least two.

               Smecker is now a complete mess. His hair is totally frazzled.

               He is sucking on cigarettes long and hard. His clothes are 
               completely disheveled.

                         explanation for this.

               Smecker points toward the ceiling revealing a huge gaping 
               hole in it just above the living room.

                              (again pointing out 
                              the hole in the

                         through the vents and coming in 
                         through the ceilings. That James 
                         Bond shit never happens in real life. 
                         Professionals don't do that. So we've 
                         got this up here, which has novice 
                         written all over it. And all this 
                         down here that's simply a perfect 
                         textbook assassination. So here's 
                         our two possibilities. We either 
                         have rank amateurs that got lucky or 
                         consummate professionals that fucked 
                         up.

               The detectives nod in agreement. They are now completely 
               taken in by Smecker's spell.

               They go over and grab seats at the bar. Smecker mixes himself 
               a gin and tonic on the other side. He is calming down now 
               and going back into cool mode. He starts to tuck his clothes 
               back in and fix his hair. He leans over the bar and sips his 
               drink. The three detectives lean in.

</b>                         With the exception of my coffee boy, 
                         you Boston detectives are starting 
                         to show signs of intelligence. So, I 
                         am going to make you privy to some 
                         information that you would not 
                         normally be. These men are all Russian 
                         mob. Not like those two peons in the 
                         alley the other day. These guys are 
                         all syndicate bosses and underbosses. 
                         I have a dossier on every man in 
                         this room. Since the Iron Curtain 
                         has gone down, the Russian syndicates 
                         have started to come here. And in 
                         the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets 
                         have opened their borders to the 
                         mafia. But the Italians, they're not 
                         convinced that the grounds in mother 
                         Russia are fertile enough for 
                         organized crime yet. So they ain't 
                         ready to commit. The Russians are 
                         coming here anyway. They are 
                         unwelcome. What we have here, 
                         gentlemen, is possibly the beginning 
                         of the first international mob war... 
                         unless I've totally missed something.

               All their faces read the gravity of the situation.

               Rocco comes out of the bathroom. He storms out to his small, 
               round, living room table at which the boys are seated. He is 
               wearing a white, polyester shirt with gold trim that is a 
               uniform of some kind for perhaps a chain of restaurants. It 
               is unbuttoned all the way down and his white t-shirt is 
               hanging out. He is wearing a name tag that reads "Jaffar".

               He is upset. He slams down a chair across from the brothers 
               who are sitting there cleaning guns and silencers. All the 
               accouterments of death are sprawled before them. They are 
               smoking as they carefully disassemble their firearms.

               The boys look at each other.

<b>               FLASHBACK EXT.  SIDEWALK  DOWNTOWN BOSTON  NIGHT

               The boys are walking across Copley Square. Connor looks at 
               the note he wrote at the police station. They stand on the 
               sidewalk and light smokes. They are in their regular garb; 
               thick naval P-coats, jeans and leather boots. They each carry 
               a mid-sized, black, duffle bag. They are serious and business-
               like. They scan the Plaza Hotel from across the street. The 
               elite exit and enter the hotel. Connor glances at his pocket 
               watch. It's 8:45.

<b>               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  ELEVATOR  NIGHT

               They enter. They look ahead, stone-faced, as the elevator 
               climbs.

               The elevator stops at the lobby level. Nine, well-dressed 
               men enter. Their faces are not shown. The boys move to the 
               back wall.

               One guy says something quickly to another in Russian. The 
               other gives a one word Russian response. They boys look at 
               each other. As the elevator climbs, their eyes focus.

               The door opens. As the men exit the elevator, each face is 
               seen individually, all are victims from Smecker's crime scene.

               The elevator goes up half a floor. They hit the stop button 
               and rummage in their bags. They suit up; black gloves and 
               black masks. They strap on four 9mm. pistols with silencers, 
               in shoulder holsters, one under each arm. Connor takes a 
               large coil of black rope and drapes it around himself. He 
               looks at Murphy and at the rope in his bag. Murphy is too 
               excited to argue.

               He puts it on. They drop to their knees, making the sign of 
               the cross. Then, up through the ceiling they go.

               The plump boss is standing in the middle of the sunken living 
               room.

               His eight Russian comrades are around him seated on the U-
               shaped pit couch. They speak Russian, but no subtitles are 
               seen. The fat man yells. He's mad about something.

               Connor is taking lots of random turns, left and right. He is

               The fat man is really yelling at them now. He is screaming 
               and pointing at each man.

               They seem to be taking it seriously.

               Their brows are drenched with sweat. Murphy crawls up next 
               to Connor. There is only enough room for the two to lie on 
               their sides facing each other.

               The boys get into a close quarters battle. An occasional 
               insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly. They begin to 
               get tangled in their own rope. The seam of the duct breaks 
               and a tangled mess of rope and MacManuses pour out.

<b>               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT

               They crash through the ceiling right above the fat man's 
               head. The rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, 
               hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above 
               the floor. They are turning in circles. The boss is balled 
               up in the fetal position on the floor. The shocked Russians 
               say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers 
               react, reaching for their guns. The Russians start to reach 
               for their guns. It's too late. The boys draw and fire as 
               they spin. Taking four shots apiece.

               There are eight dead Russians. Chests explode as they fall 
               back on the couch in a loose circle. One victims is blasted 
               over the couch.

               They notice the fat man directly beneath them. Murphy grabs 
               his Rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. They land in

               a heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his 
               knees. They each put a gun to the back of his head and recite 
               this prayer in perfect unison.

               With the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and 
               go to black and white. (Slo-mo) Choral music starts with 
               Latin script being read in the background. They take their 
               rosaries out. They slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as 
               they care for the dead. They gently turn over the bodies 
               that were on their stomachs. They brush the hair back from 
               the victims faces. They place pennies in the eyes of al the 
               corpses. When they finish their ritual, they pull off their 
               masks and look at each other. They start to grin and look 
               around. They work each other into a healthy chuckle.

               Just then, there's a knock at the door. They snap into action. 
               They stand at each side of the double doors, looking through 
               the peepholes. They see Rocco on the other side dressed as a 
               hotel employee. He wears a polyester shirt with gold trim 
               and a name tag that reads Jaffar. He has a good cart in front 
               of him.

               They look at each other and grin. Murphy nods. As they open 
               the door, Murphy grabs the food cart and pulls it in.

               Connor seizes the mortified Rocco and pulls him in, slamming 
               the door shut behind him. They run, dragging him and then 
               throw him in the midst of the bodies. They put their guns 
               right in his face.

               Murphy jokingly slaps Rocco a second time. Rocco instantly

               into laughter as they subdue Rocco. As he calms down, they

               Smecker ascends the three, small steps up to the round room.

               A NUDE DANCER sits there on the couch in a robe. She is crying 
               as she is being consoled by Detective Duffy. This small room 
               is where men watch girls through a large glass window.

               In this room a dancer performs on a floor a few feet above 
               the three private booths where each man watches from his own 
               booth. She appears as if on stage. All three windows are 
               shattered and there is blood on the wall of all three booths.

               We see assorted body parts in each booth, but no faces.

               Smecker hits an orange button on the wall and a black steel 
               door with a money slot comes slamming down in front of the 
               first booth. He does the same thing to the last booth, leaving 
               the middle one open. Both doors possess peep holes.

                         B. The guy in the middle was done 
                         with both. But this guy...

                         ...he was killed with bullets from

                         two slugs out of the wall from over

               Smecker points to two bullet holes in the wall of the booth 
               on the left. Each is marked "B". He walks over to the right 
               booth where in the exact location are two identical holes 
               marked "A".

               Smecker storms from the room. The detectives begin to follow.

               Smecker comes barreling back in, shoving them out of the 
               way. He looks at the bullet holes in the walls marked "A and 
               B" again. Something has clicked.

               He stands next to a table in the back where chairs are knocked

               Smecker flashes them a photo of a dead body. The victim is 
               shot in the head and face down in his plate of food. His 
               hands are on the table in front of him.

               They all laugh as Rocco pulls his gun and shoots Oly in the 
               head. He lands face down in his plate of food. He shoots 
               Vinnie in the chest then turns on Sal. He yells "Funny, funny,

<b>               EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND SIN BIN  NIGHT
</b>
               Rocco, Connor and Murphy are looking very serious as they 
               smoke outside the rear door, in the alley. A drug dealer in 
               a hooded Boston Bruins jacket emerges from the opposing alley.

               He stops a 13 year-old kid. The kid is scared as the drug 
               dealer slaps him. The kid give him money and the drug dealer 
               stuffs a small baggie in the boy's shirt. He lets him go and 
               withdraws into the alley.

               As the boys and Rocco watch this from the opposing alley, 
               they begin to head for them, but Vincenzo's car pulls up 
               across the street. Rocco stops the boys and denotes Vincenzo.

               The boys head in the front door. Rocco moves back into the 
               alley.

               Vincenzo enters and shuffles past the bar where the brothers 
               stand. He walks through a bead curtain at the back of the 
               busy porno house. The boys follow him.

<b>               INT.  SIN BIN  HALLWAY  NIGHT

               They go to the back, open the exit door and let Rocco in.

               The three wind down long dark hallways with Rocco leading 
               the way until they reach a green door. The boys stand, side 
               by side, directly in front of it. Rocco is just behind them.

               The three pull identical 9mm.'s and the boys pull on their 
               masks. Rocco puts on a mask that he made from a dock worker's 
               cotton hat. He looks ridiculous.

               They burst into the room, climb up a few steps and are in a

               smoking and drinking coffee, on the couch in front of three

               Rocco is looking through the peep hole down on Vincenzo. He

               They back up and focus on the money slot. A hundred dollar 
               bill comes through. Connor gives it to the dancer.

               The boys begin to recite their prayer. Rocco is smiling and 
               excited, he still hangs on to the now hyperventilating dancer.

               They press the button. The door goes straight up. Vincenzo 
               has one moment of shock before the MacManuses decimate him 
               through the glass with silenced bullets. The glass silently 
               spiders and begins to fall in spots. His chest explodes, 
               sputtering medallions and bits of gold chain inside the booth.

               The dancer faints and Rocco lays her down gently.

               The boys step down in the boot and begin their ritual.

               Rocco watches intently, intrigued. They finish and turn around 
               to see Rocco is immersed in grabbing one of the unconscious 
               dancer's breasts. They pull up their masks.

               He gets up and starts tossing money on her as the boys giggle.

               Just then two more bills come through the slots of the other 
               two doors, which have remained closed. Murphy looks through 
               left peep hole, Connor the right. Smiles spread across their 
               faces and they look at each other. They switch and each looks 
               through the other guy's peep hole.

                         Rocco, this is the real deal. We 
                         must kill without hesitation, without 
                         guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead 
                         man.

               Rocco gets serious and nods his head. Connor replaces the 
               clip in his gun and hands it to Rocco. Murphy does the same.

               He stands with one in each hand, aiming one gun at each door.

               The boys both place a finger on the appropriate orange 
               buttons, as Rocco slowly cocks his head back. With wide eyes 
               he thrusts his head forward. The doors fly up. Rocco fires 
               both guns yelling "Yeah, take it, take it!" Both the drug 
               dealer from outside and the pimp from the emergency room are 
               destroyed. Rocco then crosses his arms and fires two more 
               shots from each gun. On the opposing walls of each booth two 
               identical bullet holes appear.

               An old man appears to look at himself in the mirror of an 
               empty but very upper class bathroom. His eyes are very glazed 
               over. He puts a large leather case on the counter near the 
               sinks. A red and white blind stick hangs off his right 
               forearm.

               Yakavetta enters, crosses behind him and stands next to him.

               AUGUSTUS (72 years) sniffs the air. A look of angry 
               realization overtakes his face.

                         And when you took the wheel, who was 
                         beside you?

               Augustus begins to remove items from his suitcase. First a 
               plate. He sets it down next to the sink. Then assorted 
               colognes, cigarettes and chewing gum. He begins arranging 
               them in neat rows, always feeling with his guiding hands.

               This is a gigantic three tiered room with guards on all tiers.

               They all cock their shotguns.

               A PRISONER is shackled barefoot to a small metal cart on 
               wheels. His hands are cuffed before him with a chain linking 
               his hands and feet. A guard is pulling the cart through the 
               prison to the parole board room by a long chain. The cons 
               have their mirrors out to get a better look. His face is in 
               shadow as he bows his head.

               A metal cage is lowered around him from the ceiling. The 
               parole board looks him over. A stenographer sits poised

               bright-blue plastic tarp from his coat and spreads it across

               and walk.

               He disappears into the living room. Two white flashes and 
               the sounds of silencers. A hookerish looking mom enters frame 
               in the B.G. in the kitchen. She is talking on the phone. She

               He walks right down the hall and halts right in front of us 
               and listens. He goes into the room the wiseguys had entered.

               We hear a second of male voices in protest. Two flashes of 
               light and the sounds of silencers. A dog is heard barking.

               The man reappears in the hall and walks to its end, through 
               the kitchen. He opens a pair of sliding doors and steps out

               FLASHCUT : The man pulls out a large hunting knife and 
               disappears into each room. The sounds of hacking are heard.

               He reappears holding different pieces of bloody debris. A 
               telephone, a piece of carpet, pieces of drywall. He takes a 
               mop and cleans off the blood on the linoleum of the kitchen 
               floor.

               He walks toward us and stabs the mop in right before camera.

               It stays standing.

               FLASHCUT : We see from his p.o.v. a pile of broken bodies, 
               bloody debris and a dead dog with a mop sticking out the 
               top.

               Rocco's face is now expressionless as the two load the last

               The three burst in, all yelling at each other. They are all 
               bleeding profusely from gun shot wounds. Connor turns on the 
               gas stove and slams a new clothing iron down on the burner. 
               He has wrapped the cord around the handle so it won't burn.

               The scene fades into total silence as they viciously argue.

               They then take turns hold each other down as they cauterize 
               their wounds with the hot iron. Two guys will hold a third

               Smecker sits on the balls of his fee on a sprawling front 
               lawn. He looks out to the street and sees a forensics 
               technician kneeling before a new, gray Ford Taurus riddled 
               with bullet holes. The man marks a sea of different-sized 
               bullet casings that stretch for thirty-five feet down the 
               sidewalk. He circles two blood stains on the side walk with 
               orange chalk.

               Smecker turns and looks at the front of the house. It is 
               peppered with bullet holes, all seemingly concentrated on 
               the front stoop area. Men try to lift blood samples off the 
               white paint around the door. He stands and Dolly, Duffy and 
               Greenly are ready with pens and notebooks behind him.

</b>
               Connor, Murphy and Rocco sit in a parked van, down the street 
               from the Beaver Cleaver house. The three are sitting next to 
               each other in the longer back seat. They have a counter in 
               front of them with all their guns and accessories on it.

               The clicking of bullets into clips, and smacking of clips 
               into guns are heard. Smecker sits in the captain's chair 
               directly across from them, calmly smoking a cigarette. They 
               finish their preparation. Rocco holds up his guns.

               Murphy spies a young boy peddling his bike out of the 
               driveway. He goes to the front of the van.

               and walk across the front lawn, each carrying a black duffle 
               bag and clutching a mask. The garage is opened a crack.

               They pull it up all the way. The sun shines in on Smecker 
               who stands there smoking.

               They dive into their bags and suit up with leather gloves, 
               masks, navy P-coats and their guns.

               door pool house entrance. There is a number pad next to the

                         judging by the burn mark on her back, 
                         I think what they did...

               Rocco pulls a stun gun and zaps her with it. She goes down.

               They burst in and line up shoulder to shoulder, guns aimed.

               Smecker stands beside Rocco with his thumb and forefinger 
               extended to mimic guns. Five mafiosos sit around a poker 
               table in front of time. Two men are playing pool to their

               They begin firing. Men are dying, their chests exploding.

               Smecker moves his hands like firing guns and yells over the 
               noise.

               Smecker points to the pool table as the two players dive 
               under it.

                         The trajectory on the bullets show 
                         they came from straight across. So 
                         this means one of our shooters...

               Smecker drops to his knees in perfect synchronicity with 
               Rocco. They are side by side and leaning back.

               Rocco fires and the men under the table skip around as they 
               are riddled with bullets. Smecker's mimicking hands follow 
               him perfectly with each shot. The boys and Rocco demask.

               Rocco goes around to all the bodies and looks earnestly at 
               each one, as Connor and Murphy pick up bullet casings.

               The man they came for gets off the toilet and pulls up his 
               pants. He is expressionless. He pulls a towel rack from the 
               wall.

               The door behind Rocco begins to open outward. As the door 
               swings open, Rocco tries to angle a gun around to shoot the 
               man who is opening it. But as soon as the man sees his hand, 
               bam! he comes down on it with the towel rack. Rocco pulls 
               back in pain dropping his other gun but the gun fires, as 
               the man's blow connects. The shot pierces his stomach and 
               sends him against the wall. He holds his abdomen in pain.

               There is a moment of recognition between the man and Rocco.

               Rocco is terrified as the man dives on him and they begin 
               fighting. Murphy jumps to help, but Connor pulls him back.

               They both stand in front of the pool table about thirty feet

               Murphy is aching to help but Connor is more steady. A man 
               who has been shot starts to regain consciousness. Connor 
               turns his back to shoot him (slo-mo). Murphy sees his 
               opportunity, pulls the cue ball from the table, and rolls it 
               silently across the carpet toward Rocco.

               Connor fires with his left hand and as the casing ejects 
               from the gun he catches it in mid air and makes the sign of 
               the cross. Rocco is on his back, the man is straddling him.

               They both have each others throats and are trying to strangle 
               one another. When the ball is within arms reach, Rocco slams 
               his hand down on it and knocks his assailant in the skull.

               He straddles him and begins to mercilessly beat his face in 
               with the cue ball, yelling "You sick fuck!"

               He finally stops, gets up, runs toward the boys, and throws 
               an exhausted punch at Connor who just lays Roc down on the 
               pool table and says, "Nicely done, boy". Murphy tends to 
               Roc. Connor checks out the man and seems surprised.

               Murphy takes the bloody cue ball from Rocco's hand and 
               polishes it off on his jacket, making sure Connor cannot 
               see. He replaces it perfectly on the table. Smecker now stands 
               in front of the table with the cue shining in the background.

                         guy, it was a blunt object and they 
                         took it with them.

               Smecker exits to the left as Greenly enters from the right, 
               following Smecker out. He walks by the table furiously 
               scribbling in his notebook. Connor, Murphy and Rocco exit 
               the room, pennies in the eyes of all the corpses in the 
               background. Rocco holds two duffle bags full of poker money.

               Greenly stops, picks up the cue ball and looks at the dead 
               man. He shakes his head and says, "Nah".

               Smecker stands in the middle of the front lawn. His hair is 
               a mess. He's chain-smoking. His clothes are disheveled.

               His eyes are psychotic. He points to the parked Taurus as 
               six men in dark suits appear in a fuzzy, out-of-focus shot.

               They line up shoulder to shoulder on the sidewalk.

               (Slo-mo) Two black leather boots slowly walk up the sidewalk 
               and stop in front of the new, gray Ford Taurus then turn 
               toward the house. Il Duce removes a white balloon filled 
               with a few ounces of fluid from the pocket of his black trench 
               coat. He throws it on the walk, the blood splatters. He picks 
               up the remnants of the balloon and puts them back in his 
               pocket and stands there waiting, looking at the house.

               The boys come out, Rocco in the middle and slightly ahead of 
               them. They look out to the walk, stunned.

</b>                         Now they are staring at six guys 
                         with guns drawn. It was a fucking 
                         ambush.

               Our three heroes stand, their jaws dropping as their point 
               of view reveals the Il Duce, standing alone, his hands folded 
               in front of him.

               Suddenly, he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special 
               leather vest beneath. Six guns, all different, are holstered 
               on the front of it: three on each side extend from just below 
               his collar bones to his abdomen. Connor and Murphy don't 
               hesitate. They each draw one of their now unsilenced guns 
               from their shoulder holsters and aim, one arm over each of 
               Rocco's shoulders. The Duke draws his top two weapons and 
               aims.

                         in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few 
                         seconds this place was Armageddon! 
                         There was a fire fight!

               They all start shooting at once. The noise is deafening.

               The Taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is 
               splintering as it is riddled with bullets. Smecker is still 
               in the middle, hands raised to the heavens, turning circles.

               Rocco's pinky finger gets shot off, sending blood splattering 
               against the house. He dives in the bushes reeling. He pulls 
               a gun and starts firing.

               Murphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes 
               as well. Il Duce with lightening speed, drops the guns and 
               pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten 
               feet. He commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk, 
               all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk.

               It's him and Connor and nobody is backing down. They both 
               grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other. At the 
               same moment, The Duke gets hit in the arm and Connor takes a 
               bullet in the leg. The firing ceases for a moment.

               Connor remains steady and Il Duce looks down at his arm and 
               his own blood splattered on the sidewalk.

</b>                         No!... No! No!...

               He drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the 
               right. He fires with wrath as he screams the word No over 
               and over. Rocco and Murphy return fire from the bushes yelling 
               and swearing, as Connor does the same from his position on 
               the stoop.

               The Duke turns and runs, leaving a sea of casings, and guns 
               that extend for 35 feet down the walk. There are also two 
               blood stains.

               In a frenzy the boys and Rocco get up and withdraw some spray 
               bottles from their bags. The begin spraying all their own 
               blood stains on the stoop and the front of the white house.

               They then pick up their things and run off.

               He turns to the forensics guys at the front of the house and 
               begins to walk over to him.

               Smecker puts his finger through a big blood stain on the 
               door and smells it.

               He starts kicking the bushes and trying to tear them with

               off.

               He backs against the building and slides down to a sitting 
               position in the bushes as if he has given up. He raises his 
               head and there he sees Rocco's pinky finger lying undiscovered 
               in the bushes. He pulls a small plastic bag from his pocket

               Connor is furiously working his fingers through the lattice 
               work to open the slider to the priest's booth from his side.

               Rocco takes the priest and puts his face in front of the 
               slider to Smecker's booth, gun to the back of his head.

                         open the fuckin' thing.

               Connor gets the slider open. Rocco's long hair hangs just 
               inches from Connor's face. Connor puts his thumb and 
               forefinger through, desperately reaching for a lock of Rocco's 
               hair. Rocco jostles the priest and puts the gun hard to his 
               head.

               Rocco starts to move the priest aside and put his gun to 
               Smecker's now open slider.

               Just then Connor snags a piece of Rocco's hair and pulls him 
               back hard and fast by it, until his head slams into the 
               lattice work. Rocco grabs the priest back into position.

               Connor grabs a nice wad of Rocco's hair with his left hand, 
               so that the side of Rocco's face is now pressed to the 
               lattice. Connor then puts a gun to Rocco's head.

               is more gore. The boys and Rocco can be heard screaming from 
               a room in the basement. Yakavetta's voice is heard yelling

               Connor, Murphy, and Rocco are all hand cuffed to chairs in 
               the seated position. Their clothes are ripped and they have 
               been beaten severely. Blood covers them. Rocco has been 
               uncuffed and two men hold his open hand up as Yakavetta puts 
               a pistol at the base of his remaining pinky finger. Several

               finger is gone. The blood splatters on Connor's face. Rocco

               Murphy has scootched his chair in front of Connor's. He has 
               his back to Connor.

               He stretches his neck over and bites at the collar of his p-
               coat. He gathers as much of the material in his mouth as he 
               can. He starts to yell, "Do it!" but it is muffled.

               Connor, still sobbing, begins to kick his brother's left 
               hand repeatedly. He turns it into a bloody piece of broken 
               meat as Murphy screams through the shirt. Finally, it is 

               broken enough and Murphy pulls it through the cuff.

               He stands and breaks the chair into pieces and grabs the 
               sharpest piece. Hojo enters and Murphy shoves the sharp stick 
               up through the bottom of his chin into his head. He drags 
               him around the room yelling mumbo jumbo into his face as 
               Connor jumps up and down in his chair in rage, wanting a 
               piece of the action.

               Murphy throws the man down and Connor proceeds to viciously 
               kick his dead body. The two have turned into barbarians.

               Murphy removes the man's two guns, shiny nickel-plated 45s.

               Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and

               into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the 
               prayer.

               He stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the 
               prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their 
               father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he 
               looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a 
               hand on each of their cheeks.

               of the courtroom. Yakavetta is testifying on the stand. He

               The MacManusus stand in the foyer. There are a pair of doors 
               that go to the outside hallway and a pair that go to the 
               inside courtroom. There is an armed guard directly inside 
               the courtroom, in front of the doors.

               The door opens a crack and Connor waves the guard into the 
               foyer and starts talking to him. Then dad zaps him with a 
               stun gun. The guard is on the floor, incapacitated and 
               drooling as the boys handcuff him.

               Connor pulls out a length of chain and drapes it through the 
               door handles that lead from the hall into the foyer. He locks 
               them in with a padlock.

               They suit up, Connor and Murphy in their usual masks and 
               gloves, Dad is already in his usual dark hat and glasses.

               The boys start for the courtroom door but dad gently holds 
               them back. He takes a moment, then slowly removes his hat 
               and glasses. His sons look at one another and then remove 
               their masks. The three look into each others eyes for a

               Terrified, they all obey. Connor and Murphy pull Yakavetta 
               from the witness booth by his hair and place him on his knees 
               just before the judge's bench. They face him toward the 
               occupants of the courtroom. The father walks up and motions 
               for the judge, who is now banging his gavel and shouting in 
               protest, to come off the stand.

               As soon as he is within arms reach, dad takes him by the 
               collar and drags him down the aisle all the way to where the 
               media stands in horror. He turns and walks back down the

               The father keeps them covered. He passes the front, he looks 
               and sees a VIRGINAL-LOOKING WOMAN with her head down crying 
               into her hands. She is on the left side. He gently tilts her 
               chin forward, her eyes fixated on a faded blue butterfly on 
               the back of his hand.

               The father takes out a flask. He pours the booze on the judges 
               bench and set it ablaze. Fire alarms start to sound.

               Connor and Murphy jump up on the lawyers' tables. Murphy on 
               the prosecution side, Connor on the defense. The father has 
               his sawed-off to the back of Yakavetta's head.

               them to do it. The MacManus' read the prayer. They do not 
               falter as the flames rage behind them.

               Yakavetta, accepting his fate, closing his eyes. Peacefully,
