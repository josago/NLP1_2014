               The screen remains dark for a moment.

               In the darkness WE HEAR the film's THEME MUSIC - a gentle 
               whirring purring noise. Nothing to be alarmed about. It 
               might be a small contented motor.

<b>               FADE IN:

<b>               EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               LONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing 
               professionally alone at the end of the street.

               It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling 
               'Stardust' merrily to herself.

               CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid.

               We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - 
               haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman.

               As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then 
               turns round for a better look.

               Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the 
               man's.

               CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still 
               young enough to need two glances at the customers.

               She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She 
               hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully... 
               and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed 
               at.

<b>                                     DORA
</b>                         It'll be two quid...

               Evidently we have two quid.  

               She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders, 
               jerks her head towards the right - and sets off.

               CAMERA TRACKS after her.  Overlaid is the sound of the 
               man's footsteps.

               Dora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the 
               man who is following her.

<b>               EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               A wider street than the last - but just as empty.  

               Dora sways her way towards a small house. CAMERA FOLLOWS 
               at a respectful distance.

               CAMERA PANS from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin.  

               CLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the 
               dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film.  CAMERA 
               PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop.

               Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door - 
               glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               She switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs. 

               CAMERA TRACKS after her.

               She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so - 
               under his breath - does the Man who is following her.  

               A woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the 
               stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great 
               curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera.

               Dora reaches the landing - we are close behind her.

<b>               INT. LANDING OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               Dora unlocks the door of her room - and goes inside.

<b>               INT. DORA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               She switches on the light, throws her fur onto a chair, 
               lights the gas fire  then turns round.

               CLOSE SHOT of Dora. She holds out her hand-smiling.

               And suddenly. There is a gentle whirring purring sound.

               CAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with 
               great curiosity.

               It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to 
               fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have 
               it.

               Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her 
               mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face.

               The sound purrs on.

<b>               BLACK AND WHITE FILM SEQUENCE
</b>
               The solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone 
               at the end of a street. WE SEE her turn towards CAMERA - 
               and smile at us.

               We are watching her on a 16mm screen - projected in BLACK 
<b>               AND WHITE.
</b>
               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the surround in natural colour.

<b>               INT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               A darkened room in natural COLOUR. The movie screen images 
               are in BLACK AND WHITE.  

               We can SEE the back of a Man's head as he bends intently 
               over a projector. He is watching Dora on the screen. He is 
               breathing quickly.

               We see Dora's hips waggling their way home.

               The Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen.

               When he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two-
               toned hair winking at Dora... then we see Dora throwing 
               her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us.

               WE SEE her staring at something in bewilderment... then 
               backing away from CAMERA in fear.

               WE HEAR the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long 
               race.

               As Dora opens her mouth to scream, and a shadow falls across 
               her face - the title:

               Blots out what is happening to her.

               OTHER CREDITS FOLLOW... behind them we can see Dora's hands 
               pushing something away.

               Before the DIRECTOR'S CREDIT:

               It is very dark.

               CLOSE SHOT of a stack of deck chairs.

               Two forms behind it - a MAN'S and a WOMAN'S.

               They are intertwined and motionless... suddenly a brilliant 
               shaft of light is trained onto them.

               Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound.

               CAMERA PANS quickly to a nearby tree.

               CLOSE SHOT of the lens of a cine-camera - the motor 
               purring... a blinding spotlight.

               CAMERA PANS to the couple - the whirring of the camera is 
               overlaid.

               The Man leaps up - shielding his eyes against the light.

               He advances towards the tree.

               The spotlight goes out. There is the sound of footsteps 
               running away â€” and the night is at peace again.

               And now WE SEE who DIRECTED the picture.

<b>               LONG SHOT. AMBULANCE - DAY

               It is standing in the roadway outside Dora's house.

               WE SEE it through the finder of a small cine-camera.

<b>               EXT. STREETS BY DORA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               A crowd has gathered outside the house - and we are watching 
               them from a corner of the street (ALWAYS THROUGH THE FINDER-
<b>               MATTE).
</b>
               WE SEE several Policemen holding back the crowd as two 
               Ambulance Men hurry into the house, carrying an empty 
               stretcher.

               Gentle, whirring sound is overlaid.

               WE SEE children staring curiously into the empty ambulance - 
               and a group of Women talking excitedly to a Reporter.

               CLOSE SHOT of a SMALL MAN looking at us curiously as he 
               approaches (FILLING THE SCREEN WITHIN THE MATTE).

               The finder is lowered.

               CLOSE SHOT of a Young Man (MARK) sighting a cine-camera. 

               He lowers the camera - and turns politely to his 
               interrogator.

               He seems to have slight difficulty informing his words.

               The Ambulance Men come out of the house carrying the 
               stretcher... there is a body on it covered by a sheet.  
               Mark raises his cine-camera and photographs them. He 
               photographs the ambulance as it drives off. He photographs 
               the Policemen dispersing the crowd. He photographs his 
               Interrogator, who gladly poses for him.

               Then he slings his camera over his shoulder, and strolls 
               away.

<b>               EXT. A NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY

               newsagent's shop.  

               He glances distastefully at an array of film magazines - 
               showing actresses showing everything - then hurries into 
               the shop.

               A plump, bald-headed Man stares at Mark.

               Mark turns round.

               Mr. Peters hesitates, drumming his fingers on the counter.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He starts to drum his fingers on a 
               shelf.

<b>                                     MR. PETERS

               He stops drumming his fingers. So, at that moment, does 
               Mark.

               From under the counter he produces a thick book. Mark turns 
               round.

               He turns triumphantly to Mark.

               Mark looks at the postcard in silence.

               He opens a door at the far end of the room. We catch a 
               glimpse of a winding staircase. He starts to climb it.

</b>
               At the top of the staircase is a door. Mark and his camera 
               trudge towards it. The door opens suddenly. A vivacious 
               young redhead - Milly - pokes her head round. She has a 
               towel round her shoulders.

               From REVERSE ANGLE WE SEE Mark venture a shy smile at Milly. 
               Milly opens the door impatiently.

               Through the half-open door we catch a glimpse of a second 
               Girl (LORRAINE). She is staring out of a window, her back 
               to camera. She is naked except for a shawl draped round 
               her shoulders.  

               Mark enters the room... the door begins to close. CAMERA 
               TRACKS towards the door. On the threshold of the room, a 
               hood is thrown over our faces. THE SCREEN BLACKS OUT.

               In the darkness WE HEAR Milly's voice.

<b>               INT. STUDIO ABOVE NEWSAGENT'S - DAY

               We are with Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera. 
               Through the ground-glass of the camera WE SEE a SMALL 
               INVERTED IMAGE of Milly.

                         me!

               We hear Lorraine's voice - muffled, and very far away.

                         next month... trouble was my fiance 
                         saw us.

               The SMALL INVERTED IMAGE of Milly peers anxiously into the 
               camera.

                         show?

               The ground-glass camera begins travelling slowly down 
               Milly's back.

               CLOSE SHOT of Milly. She is on a couch, lying on her stomach 
               at a slightly oblique angle. All that WE CAN SEE are her 
               face and naked shoulders.

               From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark under the hood of an antiquated 
               camera.

               Mark's voice is MUFFLED under the hood.

               CLOSE SHOT of her naked toes. They start to wriggle.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's toes - in sandals, next to the tripod 
               of the camera. They start to wriggle. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. We watch her in profile as she 
               stares out of the window - clutching her shawl. She has 
               outstandingly beautiful features. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is standing by the side of the 
               camera, studying us thoughtfully. He is holding a remote-
               control switch panel in his hand. He clicks off several 
               lights and then switches several others on... then he ducks 
               back under the hood.

                         got under there? A girlfriend?

               We join Mark under the hood.  

               WE SEE a small INVERTED IMAGE of Milly on the ground-glass. 
               Her shoulders are now white and glistening, her spine 
               caressed by shadows. She is staring into the camera.

</b>                         I suppose you have a girlfriend?

               He adjusts the focus. We can see more clearly the contempt 
               on Milly's face.

               From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark come round to the front of 
               the camera, and insert a dark slide.

               There is a gentle KNOCK at the door, and Mr. Peters enters.

               Lorraine turns round.  

               The left side of her face is classical in its beauty. She 
               has a hare lip, which twists and distorts the whole of the

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine standing very still â€” looking at 
               him in silence.

               Milly shrugs and reaches for the coffee pot.

               Overlaid is the gentle purring of a cine-camera.

               The hand filling the glass is a woman's (MRS. STEPHENS). 
               She is sitting in a high-backed chair, and we cannot see 
               her face. Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress. 
               A group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom 
               they are singing:

                         Happy birthday to you,

               CAMERA TRACKS towards them.

               CLOSE SHOT of TONY HUNTER, a well-built youngster in his 
               middle twenties.

<b>                                     TONY

               He obviously means it.

</b>                         happy birthday to you.

               CLOSE SHOT of 'dear HELEN'. A sensitive, intelligent, and 
               extremely attractive girl, who â€” as the encircling 
               youngsters now inform us in song - is:

<b>                                     YOUNG PEOPLE
</b>                         Twenty-one today,
                         She's twenty-one today,
                         She's got the key of the door,
                         She's never been twenty-one before.

               CLOSE SHOT of the glass by Mrs. Stephens' side. It is half 
               empty. An elderly lady leans across to her. She is Mrs. 
               Partridge, slightly high on a glass of sherry.

<b>                                     MRS. PARTRIDGE
</b>                         You must be very proud of your 
                         daughter, Mrs. Stephens.

               Mrs. Stephens grunts. Someone switches on a gramophone and 
               the young couples start dancing at once. Tony hurries up 
               to Helen.

<b>                                     TONY
</b>                         May I?

               Helen goes towards him. A YOUNG MAN calls out sharply:

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         Look!

               He is pointing at something out of camera. All heads - 
               except Mrs. Stephens' - follow the direction of his gaze.  
               Mrs. Stephens continues to sit motionless in the high-backed 
               chair.

               CAMERA PANS to the window. Mark is standing there.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at Mark. We watch him over her 
               shoulder - Tony's arm encircling it.

<b>                                     TONY (O.S.)

<b>               EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - EVENING - LOW SUN
</b>
               The chap from upstairs presses his face to the window. 
               From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key 
               of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly 
               the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's 
               shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with 
               the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling 
               as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK with him.

               We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but 
               with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious 
               street.

               Mark hurries towards a side entrance.

<b>               INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING

               CLOSE SHOT of Tony - frowning.

               CAMERA PANS to Mrs. Stephens' glass... the hand which 
               refills it has begun to tremble.

<b>               INT. REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               The lights are on.

               WE FOLLOW Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which 
               leads to the hall. The sound of a dance record can be heard. 
               Mark starts to whistle it under his breath.

<b>               INT. HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               Over his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the 
               door of Helen's sitting room. The sound of Helen's party 
               fills the hall.

               Mark reaches the staircase. There is the sound of a door 
               opening. Helen's voice is overlaid:

<b>                                     HELEN (O.S.)
</b>                         Excuse me!

               Mark hesitates, then turns round. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - smiling at him.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         I don't know how many times we've 
                         passed each other on the stairs?

               Mark looks at her as if he does.

<b>                                     HELEN

                         least to say hello to you! So hello!

               Her directness is natural, consistent and very hard to 
               resist.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - smiling.

               She glances with unconcealed interest at the camera over 
               his shoulder.

               She holds out her hand... he takes it gently.

</b>                         Well, I hope to keep it going for 
                         hours yet... so when you've finished 
                         why not look in?

               She realizes that this is not the happiest of phrases.

               He hesitates.

               He hurries up the stairs.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She stares after him for a moment. 
               Then returns thoughtfully to her party.

<b>                                                               FADE OUT:
</b>
               The screen remains dark for a moment. We are with Mark in 
               a darkened room. He is giving a film show - and we are the 
               screen.

<b>               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               His cine-projector points straight at us.  A flickering 
               light shines in our eyes. We can see him crouching behind 
               the projector.

               Mark leans forward, watching the screen intently... 
               Perspiration trickles down his forehead. He is breathing 
               very quickly. The sounds of the party seep up from 
               downstairs - music, laughter, and a Girl's yelp.

               There is a knock on the door. Mark does not hear it.  

               CAMERA PANS to the door of the room. It is blacked-out 
               like a photographic dark-room. The knock is repeated.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He switches off the projector instantly.

               CAMERA PANS to an open cupboard in the corner.

               CLOSE SHOT of the shelves. They are stacked with spools of 
               film.

               CAMERA travels slowly over these spools. WE SEE Mark's 
               hand add two more to the collection; his Voice is overlaid.

               He closes the cupboard door.

<b>               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Mark comes out of the dark-room behind him - the light is 
               kept out by a baffle and a curtain. He has a pleasant, 
               normally untidy bedsitting room.

               He wipes his handkerchief across his forehead - then hurries 
               to the door. He opens it - Helen is standing there.

               She puts down the glass, turns to the door.

                         see them now?

               She turns round. He is standing by the entrance to the 
               inner room.

<b>                                     HELEN

</b>                         I'll... go first.

               He leads the way - she follows. For a moment the screen is 
               in darkness. A dark-room darkness.

<b>               INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               We can HEAR - faintly â€” the dance music from downstairs.  
               There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in 
               diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement.

               As certain events of possible interest are to take place 
               in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen.

               The room is the product of three rooms which have been 
               knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well 
               constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a 
               laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, 
               and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The 
               two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched 
               all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting 
               in the light.

               In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a 
               'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There 
               are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of 
               equipment above the 'dry'.

               This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning 
               in the ceiling above the benches.

               The other part of the room has a window at the far end of 
               it. Heavy drapes are putted across it.

               Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the 
               16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots 
               light this part of the room. There is a small control panel 
               on the wall.  

               Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. 
               All of it glistens with the affection of its owner.

               There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone 
               except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid 
               for it all.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel, 
               watching Helen.

               From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes 
               as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his. 
               For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch 
               on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of 
               Helen's hair.

               SHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a 
               loss for words.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         This is so... well - so many 
                         things... but above all - it's 
                         so...

               She takes a final look round.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         ...completely unexpected! 

               She looks at him searchingly.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Is all of it yours?

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Yes.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         I mean... is it designed by you? 
                         Furnished by you? Tell me about 
                         this room.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.  

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         It belonged to my father 

<b>                                     HELEN

</b>                         Scientist...

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Then this equipment was his?

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         No...

               He hesitates.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Sold his to buy it...

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         But it seems to be so... technical.

               She looks at him with renewed interest.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         If this is where you work, I can't 
                         wait to see what you work at.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - in difficulties.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Don't know what to show you?

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Well... what were you looking at 
                         when I interrupted you?

               He looks at her thoughtfully.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         All right!

               He crosses to the corner cupboard - opens the door.

               CLOSE SHOT of the cupboard.  WE SEE Mark's hand reach for 
               a spool of film... then hesitate, poised above another 
               spool.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching with interest.

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mark. He closes the cupboard, and 
               turns round... there is a spool of film in his hand.

               He walks slowly towards his projector... he seems â€” for 
               the moment â€” to have forgotten she is there.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching him thread the film into 
               the projector.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         This is the first... twenty-first 
                         birthday present... I'll ever have 
                         given.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         It's the first I've ever asked 
                         for...

               He places a chair a few feet away from the screen - and, 
               with an oddly courteous bow, beckons her into it. She sits 
               down.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks at her intently for a moment - 
               then turns off the lights. Over Helen's shoulder We can 
               just make out the empty screen. Mark switches on the 
               projector.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - the light flickering on her face. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at Helen's face.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. WE SEE her expression of surprise. 
               Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE the surprise growing. Over 
               Helen's shoulder we see the screen. We are looking at a 
               small boy. He is lying in his bed asleep. Although the 
               print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome 
               boy.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Mark, what a beautiful child.

               The boy turns restlessly in his sleep... one of his pillows 
               falls to the floor.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Who is he?

</b>                         Of course it is!  Then who took 
                         this film?

<b>                                     MARK

                         My Father. 

               A light - as if from a small torch â€” starts to shine on 
               the child's eyes. He moves restlessly.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         What a wonderful idea...

               The light plays on the child's left eye, then on his right. 
               It is growing brighter.

<b>                                     HELEN

                         own chi...

               The child wakes up suddenly. He stares at something... 
               then starts to scream.

<b>                                     HELEN

</b>                         ...but what was that light?  ...The 
                         camera, I suppose?  

               Mark does not answer. The small screen is filled with the 
               face of the screaming, terrified child.

               (Mark's father now tries a not altogether successful 
               dissolve:)

               WE NOW SEE the little boy standing in front of a garden 
               wall. He tries hard to climb to the top of the wall, but 
               falls over. Helen laughs. Mark watches her in silence. 
               Small Mark tries again - and again - to scale the wall... 
               At last he succeeds.

               WE SEE the little boy lying flat on the wall staring at 
               something... rapt, motionless.  

               The cine-camera which is taking this picture now tracks 
               rather clumsily towards the wall.

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT over the wall of what is fascinating young 
               Mark - A man and woman are lying on the ground, kissing. 

               The CINE-CAMERA PANS - again rather clumsily - to young 
               Mark... staring intently.

               The small screen begins to dissolve ...so does the large 
               one.

<b>               INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Over Mrs. Stephens' shoulder WE SEE the party in progress. 
               The glass by her side is full again. Tony is dancing with 
               an attractive blonde.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS
</b>                         Tony!

               He turns round.

               The head nods.

               Tony advances reluctantly towards her.

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.

               Over Tony's shoulder WE SEE a powerfully built and once 
               lovely woman.

               She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The few 
               movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing 
               away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur 
               scarcely shows.

               The fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the 
               fact that she is drunk. Her sightless eyes stare out the 
               camera as Tony reaches her.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen's eyes. The light from the projector 
               flickering into them.

               She is leaning forward, her face cupped in her hand, 
               watching the small screen intently.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. His face is cupped in his hand as he 
               watches her intently.

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE Mark in the making.

               The child is again asleep... this time he is being 
               photographed from the head of the bed - the CAMERA POINTING 
<b>               STRAIGHT DOWN AT HIS FACE.
</b>
               A beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto 
               the left, then onto the right.

<b>                                     HELEN

                         Again?

               Mark looks at her in silence.

               The boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face, 
               pulling the bedclothes round him. His right hand is limp 
               on the pillow. The light shines for a moment on this hand, 
               then goes out.  Helen half turns towards Mark.

<b>                                     HELEN

               Her attention is suddenly riveted on the screen.

                         No, Helen. 

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE something drop onto the child's 
               bed... something which stays quite still for a moment, 
               then starts crawling towards the counterpane. It is a small 
               lizard.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Mark, whatever is that?

               Her voice trails away. She stares - repelled and fascinated - 
               at the screen.

               WE SEE Mark reach for his cine-camera. 

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the 
               counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design - 
               its body is pointed towards the child's hand.

               WE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto 
               Helen's face.

               OVERLAID is the GENTLE PURRING of Mark's cine-camera. She 
               wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen.

</b>                         No!

               He switches off the spot... the purring of the camera dies 
               away. She turns towards the small screen.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         help me to understand this... this 
                         nightmare...

               The small boy is sitting upright... screaming with terror... 
               there is no sign of the lizard.

               A handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed. He continues 
               crying - looking up into someone's face.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching the screen.

               We hear a man's deep voice overlaid.

                         and stop being silly.

               Small Mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his 
               eyes... his hands are trembling.

               The small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve.

               Helen turns to Mark.

               From Helen's POV WE SEE the screen.

               Small Mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie.

               He is standing at the foot of a four-poster bed, staring 
               at something in horror and disbelief... his hands clasp 
               the bedrail tightly.

               Slowly - very slowly - he walks towards the head of the 
               bed, staring.

               His lips begin to quiver. He bends forward over the bed. 
               WE CAN SEE the back of his bowed head.

               We catch a glimpse of a woman's hands folded in front of 
               her.

               He pushes a lever on his projector as far forward as it 
               will go.

               The film is now shown at tremendous speed - We catch a 
               glimpse of a long line of cars.

               He pulls back the lever of his projector... the film returns 
               to its normal speed.

               WE SEE the same attractive young woman standing in a garden. 
               She is holding a bewildered and defiant Mark by the hand.

               Suddenly the girl runs towards camera - leaving Mark 
               standing alone.

               From Helen's POV WE SEE a tall man in a black coat walking 
               away from camera. He hurries towards small Mark - who 
               watches him anxiously.

               The back of Mark's father suddenly obscures our view of 
               small Mark... all we can see is that tall figure looking 
               downwards standing very still.

               Camera wobbles - as if the person holding it is laughing.

               The small screen comes back into focus - and suddenly our 
               camera rushes towards it.

               WE SEE a CLOSE SHOT of a CLOSE SHOT - and at the moment we 
               see it, Mark's Voice is overlaid... A whisper which echoes 
               round the room.

               We are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boy's 
               hands.

               There is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track.

               CLOSE SHOT of the shelf which encircles Mark's room.  

               We are looking at the very same camera which the small boy

               His father's finger points lo the view-finder.

               Small Mark stares into it. Small Mark begins to smile.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching himself being born.

               She turns to the projector - touches the wrong switch.

               Small Mark and his father go rapidly backwards.

               Mark turns off the projector abruptly. 

               The room is in darkness.

               WE CAN HEAR both of them breathing quickly. 

               The light goes on. Mark is standing by the exit - he keeps 
               his face averted.

               Helen walks slowly towards the exit. She glances round 
               once, over her shoulder, then goes into the other room. 

               Mark stares after her.

               She walks towards the door... turns round suddenly - almost 
               in anger.

               He turns round slowly. From his POV WE SEE the willingness 
               to understand on her face.

               store.

               A blonde is lying unconscious in front of a lift - and a 
               crowd of extras surround her. 

               As the word 'cut' dies away, the extras relax - and the 
               blonde (DIANE ASHLEY) props herself onto her elbow, looking 
               towards the Director.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Director (ARTHUR BADEN) standing beside 
               the camera.

               He glances at the CHIEF CAMERAMAN (PHILIP TALE), who nods 
               his head in agreement.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing at the back of the camera crew. 
               He shakes his head in disagreement.

               The Chief Cameraman spots Mark's small mutiny and wags his 
               finger at him. As the Chief Cameraman turns away, Mark's 
               finger automatically wags back.

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden looking at his watch. He sighs, then 
               nods to the Assistant Director who stands beside him.

               Baden walks out without a word to anyone. A hubbub of 
               chatter breaks out. The unit downs tools and begins to 
               disperse.

               CLOSE SHOT of one of the extras (VIVIAN) - a small, 
               vivacious, brunette with delicate, attractive features.

               Over his shoulder WE SEE Vivian glance towards him. He 
               nods almost imperceptibly.

               Vivian hurries towards the exit.

               Mark turns to a shelf behind him - picks up his cine-camera 
               and a little full string bag containing his lunch.

               She is leaning against a wall in a corner of an exterior 
               set - a Chinese temple or a medieval castle (or a 
               combination of each like a Pinewood drawing-room).  

               Beside her she has a small tape-recorder, or record-player. 
               We hear music - modem rhythms.

               There are several people strolling about - but no one in 
               the immediate vicinity. No one... except Mark.

               MR. JARVIS is immersed in reading a script... his eyes

               holding in his lap his cine-camera, and a black bag.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian breathing quickly.

               He walks slowly towards the studio camera.  

               She prepares for the test by switching on music and warming 
               up with dance movements.

</b>                         Come on! Get hot!
                              (she accents the 
                              rhythm)

               Mark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the 
               dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and 
               swings the camera.

               We watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of 
               the studio, from the Director's chair. And finally WE WATCH 
               HIM from Vivian's POV. She stops dancing but the music 
               continues.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         You belong there...  

               He stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then 
               bends and looks into the finder.  

               There is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen 
               goes dark. It remains dark for a moment.

               Suddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the 
               centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio 
               camera. (Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camera, 
               we see everything the right way up and in perfect 
               perspective.)

               Mark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it 
               on. He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's 
               delicate features a radiant miniature.

               The miniature smiles shyly at him. She has stopped dancing 
               and is looking directly at the camera. Music continues.

                              eyepiece)

               Through the film, we can see only her eyes - large and 
               wistful.

                         alone... all the time...

               She becomes the uninhibited Vivian again.

               He looks up from the camera; she smiles and starts keeping 
               time to the rhythm again.

               We hear his quick breathing.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks down - a little sadly - and 
               peers into the finder. (The camera dolly is on tracks - he 
               tracks forward.)

               Music continues - piano.  

               In the finder WE SEE a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced 
               prices' â€” on the shelf behind Vivian.

               From Vivian's POV WE SEE Mark leave the studio camera â€” 
               and hurry towards the trunks. She watches him wide-eyed.

               He carries the trunk towards the studio camera, and lays 
               it carefully on the floor.

               Music continues.

               Vivian peers into the front-glass of the studio camera â€” 
               as if it were a mirror. The rhythm of the music changes.

               She jumps off the trunk onto the floor.

               round the deserted studio.

               a small hook - is a tape measure.

               Mark reaches for it... then carefully measures the distance

               of chalk from his pocket and makes a small cross on the 
               floor.

               Mark hurries to the side of the studio camera and picks up 
               his cine-camera.

               We see Mark raise his cine-camera. He seems to be pointing 
               it straight at us.  We hear a gentle purring.

               He walks slowly towards her, holding his cine-camera to

               at the studio camera. She comes closer and closer.

               We see him standing almost on top of her - his cine-camera 
               trained on her.

               She looks up slowly - and a little hesitantly. Music, all 
               drums.

               He watches her in silence as she walks to the front of the 
               studio camera and takes up her position. while the drum-
               beat continues.

               Don Jarvis is leaving the unit working on the lot. It is 
               now bustling with activity.

               A girl comes up to him... She raises her cigarette for a 
               light - and looks into his eyes.  

               He hands her a box of matches... and walks away.  Over his 
               shoulder we see the other stages - apparently empty. Don 
               Jarvis hesitates, then strides towards one.

               What he is staring at is out of camera - and it is puzzling

               The great man is poised for the kill. He is moving forward 
               stealthily... and suddenly breaks into a run. 

               CAMERA PANS - and WE SEE the object of his attentions. A 
               wisp of smoke is coming from behind an alcove.

               He is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsible 
               tripod. 

               Suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. WE SEE that a 
               very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE Vivian looking at the spike.

               He raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches 
               from her throat.

               gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it.

               Just for a moment Mark's arm moves. His back hides what he 
               is doing. Suddenly WE SEE Vivian turn her head sharply - 
               she is looking at something out of camera.

               The spike is very close to her throat - but Vivian ignores 
               it, staring out of camera.

               Over Mark's shoulder we concentrate on Vivian's face.

               It is almost a scream.

               We can hear Mark breathing quickly. 

               Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her.  

               Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. WE SEE them 
               dilating with terror. There is a sudden crash as the big 
               power switches go out in the roof.

               The lights go out.

               There is a scream in the darkness.

               Then silence.

               The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is 
               seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of 
               Mrs. Stephens.  

               A bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against 
               our eyelids. It looms closer and stronger.

               Helen spins the coin on the table Mrs. Stephens listens 
               intently... the coin stops spinning.

               Her fingers shoot out and feel the surface of the coin.

               She turns the coin over and carefully feels the other side. 
               Helen watches her with a smile - then looks thoughtfully 
               at the ceiling.

               She kisses her - and glances at the whisky glass.

               She hurries out. Mrs. Stephens instantly refills her glass. 
               CLOSE SHOT of her hand. It has begun to tremble.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hands, in the green light of the dark-
               room. He is busy unloading and winding film onto a 
               developing rack.

               He puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts 
               the time clock.

               CLOSE SHOT of the time clock ticking.

               A knock is heard off.

               Mark looks up.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.  Faintly overlaid is 'She's Got the 
               Key of the Door'.  He looks down at the clock.

<b>               INT. PASSAGE - EVENING

               Helen opens the door of Mark's sitting room. We hear Mark 
               call out from the inner room:

<b>                                     MARK (O.S.)

                         there?... Developing.

               Helen goes in, closing the door behind her.

<b>               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING

               Helen enters. She speaks loudly to be heard in the dark-
               room.

<b>                                     HELEN

               Helen glances at her watch... then looks curiously round 
               the room.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She picks it up and looks at it, 
               curiously, fingering the stops.

<b>                                     MARK (O.S.)

               Helen turns round. Mark is standing on the threshold of 
               the dark-room.

               He walks towards her... he stops suddenly. He is staring 
               at the recorder in her hand.

<b>                                     HELEN

               Gently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which 
               she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding out a small package.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen glancing at her watch.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing at his. He thinks of the ticking 
               clock in the dark-room.  

               Helen looks up, and sees him.

               He looks as if he has just been voted the best cameraman 
               of the year (unanimously) - and the two films he directed 
               have both won Oscars (though Don Jarvis understood them).  

               His delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile.

               He watches her leave, standing very still.

               Offstage, the time clock explodes.

               Mark opens the developing tank, lifts out the rack of film, 
               drops it into the fixing bath.

               He switches light from green to red.  

               CLOSE SHOT - green to red dark-room lamp.  

               Mark lifts the rack of glistening film out of the fixing 
               bath and scans the image.

               CLOSE SHOT - Mark's face and the tell-tale black and white 
               images.

               CLOSE SHOT - the film. A pile of trunks. 

               In the darkness we hear a man enquire softly:

               CLOSE SHOT of a Tall Man with a severe face. He is standing 
               in front of a familiar pile of trunks marked at 'Specially 
               Reduced Prices'.  

               CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY - and WE SEE whom he is addressing. 
               It is Diane.

               CAMERA PULLS FURTHER BACK and WE SEE that we are in a small 
               theatre watching rushes...

               Cameraman's bored face... the Script Girl's puzzled face... 
               to Diane's expression of rapture as she watches herself on 
               the screen.

               From Diane's POV WE WATCH the screen. We see the Tall Man 
               (SHOP ASSISTANT) reaching for a trunk and laying it on the 
               counter. He opens it with a flourish. Vivian passes across 
               the screen - glances casually at the trunk - and wanders 
               off.

               CAMERA LINGERS for a moment on the screen as Diane (on-
               screen) smiles at the Assistant.

                         I'll take it.

               The Assistant bows and closes the trunk. We dissolve to 
               the set itself -

               The Assistant is leaning over the counter, listening 
               intently. Diane stands in front of the counter, receiving 
               the attentions of the Make-up Man.  

               Baden's voice is overlaid:

               The unit is busy preparing for a retake. The studio camera 
               (and its crew) are off camera, and we concentrate on Baden 
               briefing his artistes.  

               He is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might 
               be indecent exposure.

                         ask for a blue trunk - and when he

               From Mark's POV WE WATCH the scene being rehearsed. Diane 
               approaches the trunk counter and the Assistant smiles at 
               her.

               Mark walks away quietly from the back of the Camera Crew. 
               He hurries to the shelf where he keeps his cine-camera and

               Mark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine-camera. 
               WE SEE the Assistant try to lift a blue trunk - and half 
               collapse with the weight of it.

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden - beaming.

               The Assistant manages to drag the trunk forward. He leans 
               over it - exhausted - then starts to open it.

               Mark moves round until Diane's face is in the finder.

               As the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes 
               above the rim of the lid... WE HEAR her scream.

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden - freezing.  

               There is the sound of a body falling to the ground.

               Mark is sitting by an open window at the far end of the 
               canteen. His cine-camera and lunch basket are by his side.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE that the unit (with the exception 
               of Diane and Baden) is crowded into the canteen.

               They have formed themselves into small groups and are 
               talking in whispers.  The Assistant Director is standing 
               with his back to the door. A GIRL calls out:

               Mark glances at a group in the comer. The Trunk Assistant 
               is encircled by eager listeners.

                         expression.

               Mark glances out of the window.

               From his POV WE SEE a police car driving across the 
               courtyard. Mark watches with great interest - then reaches 
               for his cine-camera.

               He photographs the police, then puts his cine-camera on to 
               the table and sits back... waiting. CAMERA LINGERS for a 
               moment on the folded tripod.

               The set is completely deserted. It is lit by a single lamp. 
               A solitary trunk stands on the counter, its lid closed.  

               WE SEE Don Jarvis enter, followed by the two Policemen. 
               Baden and the Publicity man bring up the rear.

               Don Jarvis points towards the trunks department. The Chief 
               Inspector nods, then he and the Sergeant approach the 
               counter.

               Carefully the Inspector raises the lid of the trunk - he 
               looks inside.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector - over the top of the lid. His 
               expression is mainly one of surprise.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Sergeant staring into the trunk. He is 
               also surprised - but there is nausea in his face.  

               They look up at almost the same moment... their eyes meet.

               Overlaid is the sound of a door opening... the buzz of 
               conversation dies away. We hear Don Jarvis' voice.

               Boy looks at him waringly.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE Don Jarvis standing in the doorway -

               The Policemen and the Extra are walking away from camera 
               down a passage. A few members of other units pass them by 
               without a glance. One of these (A GIRL) smiles into camera.

               As the Inspector opens the door of the dressing room, Mark

               the Sergeant. The Sergeant turns to close the door. He 
               sees Mark. straightens his tie and looks as severe as he 
               can.

               From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE Mark turn to go into the

               The Sergeant stares at the camera on his shoulder... then 
               the door closes.

               barring the entrance.

               The Inspector hurries towards the door of the set. 

               The Constable opens it - and the Inspector goes inside. 

               The Constable closes the door - and stands in front of it. 

               Mark turns away quickly.

<b>               EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
</b>
               The carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone 
               in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of 
               Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round 
               carefully, then slips inside.

<b>               INT. STAGE E. - DAY
</b>
               Facing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond 
               this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this 
               yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the 
               furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can 
               faintly be heard coming from this set. 

               Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to 
               the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb 
               the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark 
               moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above 
               the Policemen.

               Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down.

               Far below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the 
               Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into 
               an open trunk. Detectives are photographing the set. Mark 
               raises his cine-camera... its gentle purring seems to echo 
               round the studio.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's jacket pocket. A row of pencils is 
               sticking out. As he leans forward the pencils tilt. 

               Through the finder-matte of Mark's camera WE SEE the 
               Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and 
               nodding.

               A faint echo of conversation is overlaid.

                         caused by the same instrument...

               Mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens). 
               The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the 
               finder over the lid of the trunk.

               He points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's 
               eye-line.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               He balances carefully - then raises the camera above his 
               head. As he leans forward, the pencils fall. WE SEE them 
               shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below. 
               They make three separate landings.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector. Looking up.

               From his POV WE SEE tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow...

               The Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the 
               normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete 
               silence.

               Complete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing... 
               And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own 
               minds - WE HEAR a purring sound from the shadows above. 
               The Inspector listens intently.

               There is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns.

                         our hands, and if we don't get him 
                         quickly there'll be a third unsolved 
                         murder to report to the 
                         Commissioner. So let's hurry things

               The 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the 
               trunk counter. In the brilliant flash of light that ensues, 
               we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high 
               in the scaffolding... But then we are looking for it - no 
               one else is. The flashlight dies away.  

               The scene fades with it.

               his.

               Mark holds the door open for Helen and she goes into the 
               passage. Mark turns and takes a long look at Mrs. Stephens. 
               She is in the middle of raising her glass. She stops 
               suddenly, the glass poised mid-air. He goes out - closing 
               the door. She finishes her drink as if it is her last.

               Helen is waiting by the door.

               From her POV WE SEE Mark coming eagerly towards her, his

               Suddenly Mark stands motionless. He is staring at something 
               off camera.

               Especially when -

               Her voice trails away... she is staring at Mark staring at 
               something.

               In the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple 
               are kissing.

               Mark stands motionless, staring at them. Automatically his 
               hand reaches for his camera. Helen starts to speak - then 
               looks at him in silence. The man glances round. Mark hurries 
               away and Helen stares after him.

               A small and very pleasant restaurant, almost full. Helen 
               and Mark have a corner table. They are dining by 
               candlelight, and there is a bottle of wine in the middle 
               of the table.

               As CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS them, Helen is laughing.

               revealing a shadow of a woman undressing.

               Mark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly.

               He stares ahead of him... and continues to stare ahead of 
               him.

               He hesitates.

               The door at the end of the passage opens and Tony emerges 
               in his dressing-gown, carrying a towel. He avoids looking 
               at them - goes into the bathroom opposite, and slams the 
               door.

               There is the sound of running water.

<b>                                     HELEN

                              very close to him, 
                              smiling up into 
                              his face)
                         Will you go to bed now - and not 
                         stop up watching those films?

</b>                         Well... I've a little work to do... 
                         then I'll go to bed... and think 
                         of how to find faces for you...

               He looks down at the face which he has found for himself. 
               She raises her head slowly.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         ...faces which - are faces which...

               She kisses him very gently on the mouth. The bathroom begins 
               to sound like a small waterfall.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Good night, Mark...

               He watches her as she goes into the room, and doses the 
               door. A light goes on beneath the door.

               He stands very still for a moment... then turns the camera 
               round and points the lens towards his lips.

               Then he turns abruptly, and hurries up the stairs.

               The waterfall cascades on.  The screen grows dark - and 
               the dark-room grows out of it.

<b>               INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               The big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into 
               a box. A small motor drives it.  CLOSE SHOT of the box. 
               Mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier. 
               Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image.

               CLOSE UP of Vivian's face, in the image.

               Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the 
               film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and 
               hurries out with it.

               Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts 
               the projector. He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone, 
               then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen.  

               Behind him something moves in the shadows 

               REVERSE SHOT of Mark.  

               Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the 
               shadows WE SEE Mark. His head obscures what he is watching 
               on the screen.

<b>               HE TURNS ROUND SUDDENLY -
</b>
               From Mark's POV WE SEE the processing sinks deep in shadow. 
               He starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at 
               the shadows at the back of the room.

               Silence - except for the whirring of the 16mm projector.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand - switching on the light.  Mark 
               turns round... he is as astonished at what he sees as he 
               can be.

               CAMERA PANS in its own good time to the back of the room.  

               Mrs. Stephens is standing in the shadows... a heavy hand 
               rests on a heavy stick... the sightless eyes stare 
               unerringly towards the light switch.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS

</b>                         The young man bathing himself 
                         brought me to your door... I managed 
                         the rest of the adventure alone...

               He stands motionless, staring at her standing motionless. 
               Above her head an ancient, half-blind camera also stares 
               at her. The only movement in the room is her smile.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS

                         get used to them.

               Mrs. Stephens' sightless eyes stare at him.

               CLOSE SHOT of her hand - tightening on the heavy stick.

               Mark nods.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS
</b>                         Every night you pace for hours 
                         above my head! Why?

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         I've no one to talk to... in the 
                         rooms I live over...

               Mrs. Stephens nods. Her hand touches the black cloth loading 
               bag, lying on the table.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS
</b>                         I'm told that you stare too much... 
                         so do I.

               CLOSE SHOT of her hand - touching the black cloth bag. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - walking slowly towards her. 

               At once she raises the heavy stick - pointing it towards 
               him.  

               CLOSE SHOT of the stick. It is a shooting stick - with a 
               sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on 
               Mark's camera.

               Mark stares at the stick, fascinated.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens - exploring the inside of the 
               black cloth bag with her free hand.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS

                         it...

</b>                         It's a changing bag... we put films 
                         in it - so that the light won't 
                         spoil them...

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS
</b>                         How odd - that the light can spoil 
                         anything...

               The screen greys out.

               In Mrs. Stephens' own dark-room we hear the hum of Mark's 
               projector - and the pounding of Mark's heart - and, very 
               faintly, the sounds of Tony bathing himself.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS
</b>                         Every night you switch on that 
                         film machine.

               We hear his tiny intake of breath.

                         wait to look at?

               The sound of his footsteps softly approaching.  Like a 
               chair?

                         now?

               Very faintly we hear Tony singing in his bath.  

<b>               FADE IN:

               The singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal.  

               Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE Mrs. Stephens holding her stick 
               in front of her.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS

               Mrs. Stephens smiles - then turns her head towards the 
               16mm screen.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS

               He takes her arm gently and guides her towards us.

               Both of them stare at the 16mm screen... She leans forward - 
               her face only inches from the screen - the light from the 
               projector flickering on to her.  

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Slowly she stretches 
               out her hands and touches the screen.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS
</b>                         What am I seeing, Mark?

               Her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen - but 
               between her outspread fingers WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of a girl's 
               terrified eyes.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS

                         It's no good - I was afraid it

               He hurries to his cine-camera.

               Mark slips a new spool of film into his cine-camera.

                         another.

               He looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch. 
               A spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. He presses 
               another switch, and then another, until the whole of her 
               face is shining with light.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS

                         on my face?

               He walks towards her. She starts to back away.

               The shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. WE 
               SEE him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod.  

               Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world.  

               WE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than 
               we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog 
               which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching... 
               the purring changes direction.

               Mrs. Stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped 
               her heavy stick. It lies on the floor a few feet away from 
               her. Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly 
               on the floor. The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her 
               face. He peers excitedly into the viewfinder.

               it up. He looks at the spike on the end of it - then 
               carefully gives it to her by the handle. She grasps it 
               tightly.

               On Mark's focusing screen WE SEE the fear on her face. Her 
               hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration.

               He switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the

               to the door.

               He glances towards her.

               A member of the camera crew places his cine-camera and 
               lunch bag on a shelf. Snatches of whispered conversations 
               are overlaid.

               Mark turns round and walks towards the small group of people 
               assembled round the studio camera -

               The driver glances round at his passenger whose face is 
               completely obscured by the book. All WE CAN SEE is a shock

               The (studio) camera is ready for a tracking shot. The set 
               is redressed as the Hat Department of the store. The 
               Inspector stands on the dolly, looking round with interest.  

               The Doctor is sitting in a chair watching everything like 
               an excited schoolboy. The Sergeant has positioned himself 
               near the sound crew.  

               Baden walks on to the set, his arm round Diane's shoulder. 
               He is talking to her softly. She keeps her eyes on the 
               floor; he leads her to the front of the studio camera.

                         with you.

               He pats her arm reassuringly. The Chief Cameraman nods to 
               Mark.

               From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark pull a tape measure 
               from the front of the camera and hold it to Diane's 
               forehead. From Mark's POV WE SEE the Inspector watching 
               him over the top of the studio camera. A man with a shock 
               of white hair is also watching him... and the Sergeant 
               stares at him from the other side of the set. The tape 
               measure in Mark's hand remains steady.

               From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark replace the tape 
               measure and take up his position on a small stool by the 
               side of the camera.

               The Doctor sneezes violently - and all heads turn towards 
               him.

               In the nervous laughter that follows, the Assistant 
               Cameraman whispers to the Chief Cameraman.

               Over the Inspector's shoulder WE TRACK towards the 
               rehearsal. WE SEE Mark swing out into space on his stool, 
               turning the handle of the focus-puller. Diane approaches 
               the hat counter. The Assistant smiles at her.

               The Assistant hands her a hat. Diane tries it on.

               She bursts into tears and runs off the set. From the 
               Inspector's POV WE SEE Baden whisper to the Assistant 
               Director - then hurry after Diane.

               The unit dissolves into small, chattering groups. The

               He bustles off and the Doctor is left alone. He glances 
               round thoughtfully.

               From the Doctor's POV WE SEE the small, chattering groups. 
               Then we see Mark standing a few yards away, watching him. 
               The Doctor smiles at him pleasantly.

               He looks at Mark with renewed interest. So does the 
               Inspector.

               From his POV WE SEE Mark and the Doctor talking. The Doctor 
               is fidgeting with his watch chain. Mark fidgets with his 
               jacket button. The Inspector then glances towards the Hat 
               Salesman, who is holding court in the comer. We return to 
               Mark and the Doctor.

               She is lying in bed - completely drunk - snoring lustily. 
               A hand smooths her forehead.

               Helen is leaning over the bed. She has her coat on.

</b>                         Darling...

               She shakes her mother's shoulders. Mrs. Stephens snores 
               on.

</b>                         Darling.

               She shakes her again â€” but it is hopeless. Helen pulls the 
               bedclothes round her mother, then turns away. She picks up 
               a large envelope and her handbag, and hurries to the door.

               Helen walks towards the stairs. The door of Tony's room 
               opens, and he pokes his head round.

                              (he turns to his

                         ... by the way... your mother was 
                         yelling out something before you

               He goes into his room, closing the door. She stares after 
               him for a moment, then hurries up the stairs.

               No answer. She knocks again, then opens the door and goes 
               inside.

               Helen enters and glances towards the door of the dark-room.

</b>                         Mark?  No answer. She looks 
                         thoughtfully at the envelope in 
                         her hand - then goes in to the 
                         dark-room.

<b>               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM
</b>
               Helen fumbles for a switch... she finds one and presses 
               it. A spotlight falls on Mark's projector, throwing its 
               shadow on to the dazzling white screen. Helen smiles, and 
               walks towards the projector.

               Taxi arrives and Mark gets out.

               holding her envelope thoughtfully.

</b>
               She smiles suddenly and opens her envelope. She takes out 
               a bound manuscript. We see a label on the manuscript: The 
               Magic Camera by Helen Stephens. She takes a pencil from 
               her pocket, and opens the manuscript. Then she sits at 
               Mark's table and writes a note on the flyleaf. The projector 
               is at her elbow.

               Helen closes the manuscript and lays it carefully by the 
               side of the projector. She turns to leave - then looks 
               curiously at the projector.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - hesitating. Like a small girl in 
               front of her mother's make-up box, she touches the projector 
               tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch. A 
               beam of light shoots out. We watch Helen's face as she 
               looks at the screen. Nothing seems wrong for a few seconds - 
               then something starts to happen to the comers of her 
               mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot 
               stop watching. Some kind of sound comes from the back of 
               her throat. Her hands dig into the table and she tries to 
               stand up. She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps 
               on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, 
               she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards 
               the door.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing there - watching her.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen staring at him... again we hear that 
               sound from the back of her throat. He looks away from her 
               at once.

               of a small boy. Helen wheels round. The screaming seems to 
               be coming from the walls. Mark's hand is on a switch - one

</b>                         Not if you're frightened...

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Look at me!

               Slowly he faces her.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         What did you do... to those girls?

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         No.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         What did you do, Mark...?

               He tries to turn away - but she follows him.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         If you want to torment me... for 
                         the rest of my life... then make 
                         me imagine!

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - his eyes closed.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         What did you do ... to those girls?

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Can't...

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Show me, Mark...

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         But if you're frightened...

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Show me - or I'll remain 
                         frightened... for the rest of my 
                         life.  Show me!

               He turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up. He releases 
               the tripod.

               CAMERA HOLDS on Helen. She stands very still against the 
               wall. Mark's voice is overlaid.

<b>                                     MARK (O.S.)
</b>                         Do you know... what the most 
                         frightening thing in the world 
                         is?...

               She is looking at something, puzzled.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         It's fear.

               The sound of his footsteps approaching...

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         So I did something... very simple...

               WE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Very simple.

               WE SEE the spike approaching her throat... but she is 
               looking at something else.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         When they felt the spike... touching 
                         their throats... and knew I was 
                         going to kill them...

               The spike is touching her throat.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         ... I made them - watch their own 
                         deaths!

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen's face several times its natural size. 
               She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying 
               mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. The 
               mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There 
               is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of 
               the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distorted 
               face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle 
               of her forehead.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Made them see their own terror as 
                         the spike went in... and if death 
                         has a face, they saw that too!

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat 
               pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of 
               the camera.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Not you! Not you! I'll never 
                         photograph you! I promised - I 
                         promised - Not you!  

               Helen's eyes are closed. The spike is still touching her 
               throat.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark â€” his face turned away from the 
               viewfinder.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         ... frightened ... for you...

               There's the sound of a car pulling up. He hurries to the 
               other room.

<b>               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               The Police arrive: three cars.  Mark appears at an upstairs 
               window with his camera.

<b>                                     SERGEANT
</b>                         Look out!

               He thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his 
               camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge 
               for the house. Mark disappears.

<b>               INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. He 
               knows exactly what he has to do.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         I've been ready for this... for 
                         such a long time...

               Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. Then 
               he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards 
               him...

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         What are you...

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         It'll be all right.

               He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, 
               then switches on all the floodlights. WE CAN HEAR the 
               Policemen pounding on the door.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         I can beat that!

               He crosses to a switch - presses it.  The room is filled 
               with a small boy's screaming.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Give yourself up... Mark!

               He stands next to her, and looks at his long array of 
               cameras. WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted with 
               a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of 
               the older cameras have flashlights attached.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Watch them, Helen... Watch them 
                         say goodbye - one by one -
                              (he presses a master 
                              switch on the wait)
                         I've timed this... so often...

               Slowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metallic 
               disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye 
               of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off 
               with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of 
               footsteps hurrying up the stairs.

               Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer â€” are the spikes of 
               the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the 
               approach - and Helen's terrified face.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         No - No!

               The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches 
               the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his 
               projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         I wish... I could have found your 
                         faces for you... 

               The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door. 

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Helen - I'm afraid!

               We see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. The 
               spikes are against his throat. The eye of the camera is 
               winking rapidly.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         I'm glad I'm afraid!

               Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door... 
               as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes. 
               The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls 
               back. He crashes against the small table, which falls over. 
               He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by 
               the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face 
               like a canopy. WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine-
               camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of 
               The Magic Camera.

               The Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless 
               at what they see.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands.

               The child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute 
               silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father:

<b>                                     FATHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                         Don't be a silly boy... there's 
                         nothing to be afraid of...

               And a small voice answers.

<b>                                     CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                         Good night, Daddy...

               The spotlights begin to dim... The dazzling white of the 
               16mm screen fades slowly into greyness...

               The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small 
               child.

<b>                                                               FADE OUT:

<b>               THE END
