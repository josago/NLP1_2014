<b>          FADE IN:
</b>

<b>          A PAIR OF HANDS
</b>          men's hands, nicely groomed, hold a small white terry
          towel spoiled by blood-red spots. The hands rinse the
          towel in a copper bar sink. The stains soften but stay.
          A tan jacket sleeve, spotted the same way, moves INTO
          FRAM. The hands dab the wet towel at the spots, with no
          more success, and throw it into the sink. It falls half
          in, still dripping the stains a drop at a time to the
          floor.

<b>          ALL IN CLOSEUP
</b>          The owner of the hands walks to a wine rack, opens a
          bottle of white wine, drizzles the wine on the jacket
          sleeve. The stains disappear. He hangs his jacket on a
          hook and walks from

<b>                         THE CELLAR
</b>          and up the narrow stairs. His FOOTFALLS ECHO against the
          unadorned cement block walls. We see his shape, mid-
          forties, powerful, his shirt pulled out. He's carrying
          the open bottle by the neck.

          Still seen from behind, the man emerges from the cellar
          into a contrastingly elegant space with a wood-beamed.
          ceiling, vaguely European. He walks along a narrow aisle
          of wooden diamond bins. As the space widens his foot hits
          something in his path. He bends to find a shoe. He
          glances about nervously. There are shutters on the
          storefront windows. Shoe in hand, he tightens the
          shutters. We see his profile, a good-looking man.
          He walks toward a brighter room at the back of the store,
          the Tasting Room. Now he retrieves a pair of women's
          trousers from the floor, and as he straightens up we see
          his entire face, genial, venial, redeemed by his smile.
          ALEX GATES. He speaks nonchalantly toward the room.

</b>          These people -- all they really want
          is something to brag about at dinner
          parties.
          He swigs from the bottle of white wine, grimaces, detours
          behind the counter, and spits the mouthful into the
          plastic lined wastebasket. He throws the bottle away.

</b>          There's a basket of baguettes on the counter. Alex breaks
          off an end and chews it to rid his mouth of the taste of
          the wine. Still chewing, he walks toward the tasting
          room.

</b>          It seems empty except for a large wooden table, folding
          chairs in disarray, open bottles clustered at one end of
          the table. A chalkboard on the wall has CHATEAU
          BEYCHEVELLE written across it at the top, vintages listed
          underneath. The woman's voice that replies is
          Gabriella's.

<b>          GABRIELLA (0.S.)

          Maybe I should get dressed.
          Leaning against the corner is a woman wearing only her
          panties and a shirt. In her mid-twenties she has striking
          South American looks. GABRIELLA VASQUEZ. She's sipping
          red wine from a plastic glass.

          He throws away some of the glasses.

</b>          Duboeuf has a nose and a palate --
          like a gift from God. He can taste

          He bends down to pick up the chunks of baguette strewn on

          her breast to the glass and then to his mouth.

          locked across the parking lot. A MAN in his twenties,
          whose tropical shirt fairly glows under the security

</b>          This is not your car, sir. This car

          Alex buries the gun in the rear of his waistband as though
          he's rubbing his stiff back and cranks his smile to a
          higher wattage than the security lights.

          the throttle to idle speed. The engine quiets down. The

          He clips Alex on the other leg as he tries to crawl away.
          The physical effort shortens Victor's breathing. His
          cough sprays blood. He tightens his grip on the club.

          down on the coffee table instead. The glass-explodes. He
          has to push the words out through aâ€¢coughing spasm.

          clinic!
          Alex staggers to his feet. Victor is struggling for
          breath. Alex jerks the golf club away from him and tosses
          it on the floor.

          He picks up a sofa pillow to arrange it for him. Victor
          gives him a grateful smile. Alex presses the pillow down
          over his face before he can react. His feet flail. Alex
          has to lie on top of him to hold him down. A couple
          making out on the couch. The GUN THUMPS to the floor.
          Victor's movements slow, and stop. Alex takes no chances.
          He keeps the pillow jammed down until there's no
          possibility of trickery. Satisfied, he rolls Victor's
          dead body onto the floor, steps over it, and with steady
          hands he opens a bottle of very expensive wine. He pours
          a glass.

          Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates
          Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges.
          forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his
          knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle
          once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with
          adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex
          drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The
          shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          You knew it wasn't dead.
          Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.

<b>                         JASON
</b>          Mom didn't take the necklace.
          did.

</b>          Then you killed her yourself.
          Jason slowly nods.

<b>                         JASON
</b>          And you were in the car behind us.
          Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no
          longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the
          bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying
          slightly.

<b>                         GABRIELLA
</b>          We were supposed to turn him ini I
          didn't think you were going to kill
          him!

<b>                         JASON
</b>          Well, I didn't.
          Alex manages to laugh.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          Jesus. You set me up. You had her
          call me.

<b>                         (TO GABRIELLA)
</b>          Shit... I believed you.
          Jason pushes to his feet and heads for the cockpit.

<b>                         JASON
</b>          I'll get on the radio.
          Gabriella wraps the strips of sheet tightly around what's
          left of Alex to bandage. She smears away the tears so she
          can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She
          looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace.
          They look at each other.

<b>                         JASON
</b>          has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course.
          Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare
          gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps
          beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his
          arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses
          the radio.

           The boat heads back to port.

          At an unused pier Gabriella leans back against the line to
          hold the boat in place. Henry and Jason carry Alex off
          the boat and lay him on the planks. SIRENS can be faintly
          heard. Jason leaps back on the boat. Henry pushes them
          off.

</b>          I will be.

<b>                         HENRY
</b>          See ya.
          He and Jason wave goodbye. The boat moves out. Henry is
          left with Alex.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          (weakly; to Henry)
          What's your name?

<b>                         HENRY
</b>          No way --

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          (still the salesman)
          -- No, listen, listen -- this is
          worth a fortune.

<b>                         HENRY
</b>          Yeah. Good advice.
          And he walks away fast.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>          Wait, don't go! Come back here.
          Come on back!

          Henry's gone. Alex rolls onto his belly and starts
          dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to
          give up hope in a hopeless situation.
