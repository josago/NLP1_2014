          BEN STONE, 23, cute in a chunky Jewish guy sort of way, boxes one
          of his roommates, MARTIN. His other roommates, JAY and JASON fight
          with broom sticks. JONAH drinks beer on the couch spectating.

           We see Ben and Jay fighting. At one point they fight with gloves
          which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool.
           Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head.
          There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get
          cloudier and cloudier. He starts coughing hysterically and takes
          it off.

           A boom box is playing. The boys are now free style rapping. It
          is terrible but they are having a blast. Pot is being smoked.
          Beer is around.

          Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe
          have her point it out to us on a
          globe? I don't understand the young
          talent in this town! It doesn't make
          any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm
          more famous than half the people we
          talk to anyway! No one stands up. No
          one has the balls to sit them down and
          say, "Look, just cut the shit."But
          everybody works for `em. They're all
          on the payroll. They're all sucking
          the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to-
          eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the
          shit." And all these stars just to
          fuck it up. That's what they do. They
          fuck my day up! And it pisses me off!
          And now I'm sweating.

<b>          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER
</b>
          Alison sleeps while Ben holds the baby. Everyone else has gone
          home.

<b>                          BEN
</b>           (to the baby)
           And then your mommy said, "Just do it,
           already," which was very confusing to
           Daddy. So I listened to the most
           literal translation of that and I just
           did it, already. What would you do?
           Don't tell Mommy, but it was the
           smartest thing I ever did, listening
           to her, because now you're here. Isn't
           that nice? I think it is.

                         

<b>          EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
</b>
          Ben and a Nurse push Alison and the baby in a wheelchair.

                         

<b>          I/E ALISON'S CAR
</b>          Ben drives while Alison and the baby are in the back seat.

<b>                          ALISON
</b>           I hope your apartment's big enough for
           the three of us.

<b>                          BEN
</b>           It definitely is. That's why I got one
           in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The
           only thing is we have to decide if
           we're going to be Crips or Bloods
           before we get there.

<b>                          ALISON
</b>           Well, I look good in red.

<b>           KNOCKED UP - 139.
</b>
                         

<b>                          BEN
</b>           I look good in blue. The fighting
           continues. We could just throw off
           everyone and become Latin Kings.

<b>                          ALISON
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                          BEN
</b>           We both look good in gold.

<b>                          ALISON
</b>           Good choice. I would yell at you about
           driving so slow, except the baby's
           here.

<b>                          BEN
</b>           No, these guys can honk all they want.
           I ain't going faster than twelve. It
           might take us around three hours to
           get home, though.
          The car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting
          behind them.

<b>          FADE OUT.
