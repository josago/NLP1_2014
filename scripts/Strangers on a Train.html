<b>EXT. UNION STATION, WASHINGTON, D.C. DAY
</b><b>LONG SHOT THE CAPITOL DOME IN THE B.G. AND THE AUTOMOBILE
</b><b>ENTRANCE TO THE STATION IN THE F.G. LOW CAMERA
</b>
Activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers
with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera.

We FOCUS on a taxi pulling up and stopping, The driver hands
out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis
rackets in cases to a redcap. CAMERA PANS DOWN as the
passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes
and the lower part of his trousers. He is wearing dark
colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. The
feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of
scene. Immediately a chauffeur-driven limousine drives up
and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of
this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to
be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are
all we see of him. The sport shoes start off in the wake of
the brogues.


<b>INT. STATION LOBBY
</b>
CAMERA FOLLOWS the sport shoes and the brogues across the
lobby into a passenger tunnel. There is the usual activity
of passengers walking to and from, a loud-speaker announcing
trains, etc.


<b>EXT. PASSENGER TUNNEL
</b>
As the brogues and the sport shoes emerge to the train
platform, CAMERA PANS them over to the steps of the train.


<b>INT. TRAIN
</b>
The brogues and the sport shoes pass separately down the
aisle, the sport shoes turning in at a compartment door and
the brogues continuing toward the parlor car.

<b>                                                DISSOLVE TO:

The brogues come to rest before a chair as the owner sits
down. A moment later the sport shoes come to rest. before
in adjoining chair.

The legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out, and one
of the shoes touches one of the brogues.

                      MAN'S VOICE (over scene)
          Oh, excuse Me!

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to SHOW two young men seated in two
parlor car chairs. BRUN0 ANTHONY, the wearer of the sport
shoes, is about twenty-five. He wears his expensive clothes
with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always
had the best. The wearer of the brogues is a fine looking
but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. This is
GUY HAINES. He, too, is in his middle twenties and is well
dressed because he can now afford to be. He nods politely,
acknowledging Bruno's apology, then turns away with the
gesture implying he wants privacy.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (smiling with sudden
               recognition)
          I beg your pardon, but aren't you
          Guy Haines.

Guy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well known
tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience
before.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (snapping his finger)
          Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right
          off the court in South Orange last
          season. What a backhand! Made the
          semi-finals, didn't you?

Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his
magazine rolled up in is fist.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (with open admiration)
          I certainly admire people who do
          things.
              (smiling and
               introducing himself)
          I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy
          looks up. Bruno indicates his gold
          tie pin which bears his name in cut-
          out letters. Guy looks at it with
          the faintest expression of disdain.
          I suppose you think it's corny. But
          my mother gave it to me so of course
          I wear it to please her.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (patiently)(a faint
               smile)
          How do you do.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (with an apologetic
               grin)
          I don't usually talk so much.   Go
          Ahead and read.

<b>                        GUY
</b>              (wryly)
          Thanks.
Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open
appraisal.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          It must be pretty exciting to be so
          important.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (fidgeting slightly)
          A tennis player isn't so important.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          People who do things are important.
          I never seem to do anything.

Not knowing how to answer this, Guy looks a little
embarrassed.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (still insistent on
               being friendly)
          I suppose you're going to Southampton --
          for the doubles.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (politely)
          You are a tennis fan.

Bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Wish I could see you play. But I've
          got to be back in Washington tomorrow.
          I live in Arlington, you know.

He has taken out a cigarette case.   Holds it out to Guy.

</b>             Cigarette?

<b>                         GUY
</b>             Not now, thanks.          I don't smoke much.

<b>                         BRUNO
</b>             I smoke too much.

He fumbles for a match.          Guy brings out a lighter and hands
it to Bruno.

<b>                         BRUNO
</b>             Thanks.
                 (he stares at the
                  lighter, impressed)
             Elegant.

on it, and underneath is engraved the inscription: "To G

Guy reacts sharply.

<b>                               GUY
</b>                    (coldly)
             Yes?

<b>                         BRUNO
</b>             Anne Burton. Sometimes I turn the
             sport page and look at the society
             news. And the pictures. She's very
             beautiful, Senator Burton's daughter.

<b>                         GUY
</b>             You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony.

<b>                         BRUNO
</b>             Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from
             today's stock reports to Li'l Abner,
             and I got the answer.

<b>                      BRUNO (CONT'D)
</b>          Even news about people I don't know.
          Like who'd like to marry whom when
          his wife gets her divorce.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (sharply)
          Perhaps you read too much.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (contritely)
          There I go again. Too friendly. I
          meet someone I' like and open my yap
          too wide. I'm sorry...
At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          That's all right. Forget it.    I
          guess I'm pretty jumpy.

Bruno smiles with and signals a waiter.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          There's a new cure for that.
              (to waiter)
          Scotch and plain water. A pair.
          Double.
              (to Guy with a chuckle)
          Only kind of doubles I play.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          You'll have to drink both of them.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (grinning)
          And I can do it.
              (moving in)
          When's the wedding?

<b>                      GUY
</b>          What?

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          The wedding. You and Anne Burton.
              (a gesture of
               explanation)
          It was in the papers.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          It shouldn't have been. Unless
          they've legalized bigamy overnight.

<b>                     BRUNO
</b>         I have a theory about that. I'd
         like to tell you about it some time.
         But right now I suppose divorce Is
         still the simplest operation.

The waiter has brought the drinks. Bruno slips the lighter
into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he
gives to the waiter, waving away the change. He offers a
glass to Guy. Guy takes it.

<b>                     GUY
</b>             (as if he needs it)
         I guess I will.
<b>                     BRUNO
</b>             (happily)
         This is wonderful -- having your
         company all the way to New York.

<b>                     GUY
</b>             (forced to explain)
         As a matter of fact, I'm not going
         direct. I'm stopping off. At
         Metcalf.

<b>                     BRUNO
</b>         Metcalf? What would anybody want to
         go there for?

<b>                     GUY
</b>         It's my home town.

<b>                     BRUNO
</b>         Oh, I get it! A little talk with
         your wife to about the divorce! I

         Held her hand in high school and
         before you knew it -- hooked!

         Am I right?

         Close enough.

<b>                     BRUNO
</b>             (raises his glass)
         Well, here's luck, Guy. Drink up --

          go to the dining car.

               who is passing through
               with a food-laden
               tray)
          Do you know if there are any vacant
          seats in the dining car now?

The waiter is hovering impatiently.   Guy gives in out of
embarrassment.

<b>INT. BRUNO'S COMPARTMENT ON TRAIN (PROCESS)
</b>
Bruno and Guy are finishing lunch. Bruno has been drinking
and his eyes are bright and feverish. An almost empty liquor
bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with
gaudily Illustrated dust jackets. Bruno has in unlighted
cigarette in his mouth. Guy's lighter is on the table.
Bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights
his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Sure, I went to college. Three of
          them. Every time they kicked me out
          my father threw me back in.
              (bitterly)
          He finally gave up. He thinks I'm
          awfully small fry, not worth the
          bait.
              (wistfully)
          You my friend, Guy?

<b>                       GUY
</b>          Sure.   I'm your friend, Bruno.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (a little woozy)
          No, you're not, nobody thinks I'm
          anything special. Only my mother.
              (empties the bottle
               into his glass)
          My father hates me.

Guy smiles this off as nonsense.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          You must be imagining things.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (hitting the bottom
               of the bottle for
               the last drop)
          And I hate him. He thinks   I ought
          to catch the eight-five bus  every
          morning, punch a timeclock  and work
          my way up selling paint or  something.
          Him -- with all his money!

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (amused by Bruno)
          Well, what do you want to do?

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          You mean before or after I kill him?

   Before, of course.

<b>               BRUNO
</b>       (leaning forward
        eagerly)
   I want to do everything. I got a
   theory you're supposed to do
   everything before you die. Have you
   ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a
   hundred and fifty miles an hour?

<b>                 GUY
</b>   Not lately.
<b>               BRUNO
</b>   I did. I flew in a jet plans too.
       (his hand traces a
        swift streak through
        the air, and he adds
        sound effects)
   Zzzzzzzp! Man, that's a thrill!
   Almost blow the sawdust out of my
   head. I'm going to make a reservation
   on the first rocket to the moon...

<b>               GUY
</b>       (amused and curious)
   What are you trying prove?

<b>               BRUNO
</b>   I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky.
   You're smart. Marrying the boss's
   daughter is a nice short cut to a
   career, isn't it?

<b>               GUY
</b>       (quickly)
   Marrying the senator's daughter has
   nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow
   look past a tennis not without being
   a goldbricker?

<b>               BRUNO
</b>   Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend,
   remember? I'd do anything for you.

<b>               GUY
</b>       (humoring Bruno)
   Sure, Bruno, sure.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    What'd you say her name was -- your

    you.

<b>                GUY
</b>    I don't think so.

<b>                BRUNO

    get your divorce no matter what?

</b>    Let's change subject, Bruno, can't
    we?

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one
    of my ideas for murdering my father?

<b>                GUY
</b>        (indicating the
         detective novels)
    You've been reading too many of these.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>        (going right on)
    You want to hear about the busted
    light socket in the bathroom, or the
    carbon monoxide in the garage?

<b>                GUY
</b>    No. I may be old fashioned, but I
    thought murder was against the law.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    But not against the law of nature.
    My theory is that everybody is a
    potential murderer. Didn't you ever
    want to kill somebody? Say one of
    those useless fellows Miriam was
    running around with?

<b>                GUY
</b>    You can't go around killing people
    just because you think they're
    useless.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    Oh, what's a life or two? Some people
    are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your --
    wife and my father, for instance.
    It reminds me of a wonderful idea
    had once. I used to put myself to
    sleep at night -- figuring it out.
    Now, let's say you want to get rid
    of your wife.

<b>                GUY
</b>    Why?

<b>                BRUNO
</b>    Let's say she refuses to give you a
    divorce --
        (raises a finger and
         stops Guy's protest)
    Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill
    her because you'd get caught. And
    what would trip you up? Motive.
    Now here's the plan...

<b>                GUY
</b>    I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.

<b>                BRUNO
</b>        (ignoring the remark)
    It's so simple, too. A couple of
    fellows meet accidentally, like you
    and me. No connection between them
    at all. Never saw each other before.
    Each of them has somebody he'd like
    to get rid of, but he can't murder
    the person he wants to get rid of.
    He'll get caught. So they swap
    murders.

<b>                GUY
</b>    Swap murders?

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Each fellow does the other fellow's
          murder. Then there is nothing to
          connect them. The one who had the
          motive isn't there. Each fellow
          murders a total stranger. Like you
          do my murder and I do yours.

<b>                      GUY

          We do talk the same language -- don't
          we, Guy?

<b>                      GUY

          I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought
          the lamb chops were a little overdone
          myself.

He holds out his hand.   Guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands.

<b>EXT. MUSIC SHOP
</b>
Typical music shop of a small town, with plate glass windows
and displays of radios, records, sheet music, etc. Activity
of a couple of customers and salespeople inside. Guy comes
along the street and goes into the shop.


<b>INT. MUSIC SHOP
</b>
As Guy enters. There are the usual counters and shelves,
pianos and radios on display, and the sound of a piano being
tuned in the back of the store. MIRIAM is finishing with a
customer at a counter. MR. HARGREAVES, the manager, is busy
at the shelves. Another girl clerk is serving a customer.
In one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out, a
customer is playing symphonic music; in a second glass cubicle
another customer is listening to a record of popular music.
A third cubicle is empty. Activity of the street is seen
through the plate glass front.

Guy walks straight to Miriam, just as she is finishing with
her woman customer, handing over a small package.

<b>                      MIRIAM
</b>              (taking money from
               customer)
          Even change. Thank you, Madam.
              (she looks up at Guy
               as the woman moves
               off)
          Well -- hello, Guy.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          You're looking well, Miriam.

Miriam's face is pretty because it is still young. She is
self-centered and inclined to be vindictive. She wears
harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her
eyes look small.

<b>                      MIRIAM
</b>          So are you. You've got a nice tan,
          playing tennis with all your rich
          friends.

<b>                      MIRIAM
</b>              (coyly)
          When you wouldn't give me the divorce
          right away, I sort of hoped it was
          because you were a little bit jealous.

<b>                       GUY
</b>              (biting)
          I got over being jealous, a long
          time ago Miriam.
Miriam's eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved
closer, within listening range.

<b>                      MIRIAM
</b>              (indicating empty
               glass cubicle)
          Let's talk in there.

Guy follows Miriam across to the empty room.   Miriam has
brought her purse along.

They enter.


<b>INT. CUBICLE
</b>
Once inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts
of the shop are heard but very faintly. The piano tuning
still goes on, but less stridently. Miriam and Guy are cooped
together in the close quarters.

<b>                      MIRIAM
</b>              (intimately)
          Now this is cosier. Sort of like

<b>                       GUY
</b>              (coldly)
          Oh, skip it, Miriam. It's pretty
          late to start flirting with a
          discarded husband. Especially when
          you're going to have another man's
          baby.

<b>                      MIRIAM

    I'm not getting a divorce.

<b>                GUY

    Why, you little doublecrosser. I

    for the past year.

<b>                MIRIAM
</b>    It's a woman's privilege to change

          I could be very pathetic as the
          deserted little mother in a courtroom,
          Guy. Think it over. Who would
          believe you?

Guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm
across the record with a loud screech. From outside we can
see heads turn. Mr. Hargreaves, the manager, is very
disturbed.


<b>MED. SHOT THROUGH GLASS PARTITION FROM HARGREAVES' VIEWPOINT
</b>We see Guy gripping Miriam's arms and apparently addressing
her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his
words. The smile has faded from Miriam's face and something
like cringing fear has taken its place. She is drawn and
tense and seems to cower beneath Guy's rage.

Mr. Hargreaves moves forward and opens Guy's tirade.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          ...That's what should happen to people
          like you. And if I...

</b>              (his eyes blazing)
          Sorry. I'm leaving.

He starts to exit from the booth.   Miriam grabs his arm and
screams at him:

<b>                      MIRIAM
</b>              (yelling like a

          You can't throw me away like an old
          shoe. I'm coming to Washington to

turning around in surprise.

The two customers in other booths, seeing the quarrel, open
their doors simultaneously and Miriam's tirade is climaxed
by a cacophony of noise, a big symphony, loud hot music, and
the apparently unaware piano tuner.


<b>EXT. MAIN STREET METCALF SHOOTING TOWARDS STATION
</b>
Guy is striding along angrily. He comes to the same
intersection and the same cop. The officer makes a friendly
gesture, is if he'd like to talk awhile, but Guy strides
past him without noticing.


<b>EXT. METCALF STATION (PROCESS)
</b>Guy comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone
booths, enters one. Inside the telephone booth, he dumps
some loose change on the shelf, sticks a nickel in the
telephone, speaks into it.

          Miss Anne Burton.

Another pause, very long. Guy is very restless. He digs a
cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth, then
looks through his pockets for his lighter, doesn't find it.
He looks puzzled, but about that time the operator speaks to
him.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (continuing)
          Right.

Guy picks coins up off the shelf and drops them into the
telephone, then waits. He shifts the receiver and fumbles
in his other jacket pocket, then turns to the phone.

Meantime the noise of a through train has been HEARD, and
the horn on a streamliner locomotive. It has come up very
fast, it is now almost to the station. Guy rises his voice
and yells into the telephone. His voice fights the roar of
the train:

The expression on his face is frenzied and suggesting that

The scene opens on a CLOSEUP OF A MAN'S HANDS. One of them
is semi-flexed and turning slowly, The other is receiving
the final touches of a manicure.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that these are Bruno's hands,
and that, he is studying them moodily, CAMERA PULLS BACK
FARTHER to reveal his mother, MRS. ANTHONY, sitting opposite

          But you have that 'look'. I can
          always tell. You haven't got into
          any more mischief, Bruno?

He denies this with a slow, solemn shake of his head.

</b>          I do hope you've forgotten about
          that silly little plan of yours?

          You're a naughty boy, Bruno. But
          you can always make me laugh.
              (she rises)
          Now get shaved, dear, before your
          father gets home.

Bruno's fist crashes down on the little table, upsetting it,
as he gets to his feet.

The painting is a horrible mess. Out of the violence of the
pattern a man's face can be discerned, wild-eyed and
distorted. We hear laughter from Bruno.


<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Bruno's roar of laughter puzzles Mrs. Anthony, but she is
pleased to hear his good humor. He puts an arm around her.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          You're wonderful, Ma! It's the old

          It is? I was trying to paint Saint
          Francis.

At this moment there is the sound of the front door opening.
Then immediately the telephone bell rings in the hall. Bruno
is instantly alert, as if he had been expecting a call. He
goes toward the door to the hall, as the butler enters.

<b>                      BUTLER
</b>              (to Bruno)
          They are ready with your call to

Bruno's father MR. ANTHONY, purposefully enters the living
room. He an impeccably dressed business man with an
uncompromising eye. His entrance momentarily blocks Bruno's
exit.

Bruno now exits into the hall, passing his father without
speaking.

The voices of Mr. and Mrs. Anthony can still be heard in
dispute as Bruno listens at phone:

          So she double-crossed you!   Are you

The phone clicks in Bruno's ear. He looks hurt for an

father off scene and his expression becomes more enigmatic.

Bruno looks off in direction of his farther's voice with an
expression which says, "Crow while you can, you haven't

cigarette lighter and as he flicks it on and off.

Suddenly they look up the street. At this very moment the

stage to look back.  The boatman's attention is also
attracted. Suddenly,  as Bruno is getting out of boat, there
is a loud scream from the island.

<b>                       VOICE
</b>              (crying out)
          She is dead!

<b>                      OTHER VOICE
</b>              (from island)
          Help! Help!

Bruno by this time has stopped onto the landing stage, and
in company with the other people, is looking back as if to
see what's wrong on the island. Then he moves away, starting
off of the landing stage. The boatman turns and glances at
Bruno, but quickly returns his attention to the disturbance
across on the island. He hurries forward and with a couple
of men passengers jumps into one of the boats. He calls to
his assistant as he gets into the boat.

<b>MEDIUM SHOT BRUNO

As Bruno calmly threads his way along the midway, we hear
above the noise of the various concessions, a shrill police
whistle in the distance. Presently a couple of policemen
comes running from direction of the main entrance and past
Bruno. He glances at them over his shoulder, then strolls
on toward the main entrance to the park.

<b>ENTRANCE TO AMUSEMENT PARK EXTERIOR
</b>
As Bruno comes out through the turnstile, he stands for a
moment on the street. At this moment a man hesitates at the
curbstone. He is blind and tapping the sidewalk with his
white cane. He takes one step into the roadway, then
hesitates. Bruno steps forward and takes the blind man's
arm. CAMERA PULLS BACK as Bruno escorts the blind man across
the road. With a sweeping gesture he holds back a couple of
cars to lot them pass.

Once on the other side of the road, the blind man utters his
thanks.

<b>                       BLIND MAN
</b>          Thanks.

He goes off.

Bruno looks back toward the park, then glances down at his

conscious of what the news is to be, but covering up.

<b>LONG SHOT LIVING ROOM FROM GUY'S VIEWPOINT
</b>
SENATOR BURTON and BARBARA BURTON are seated near a desk on
the farthest side of the room. Senator Burton is a
distinguished fifty, a man with great pride in tradition,
his family and his career. Barbara, Anne's younger sister,
is a lively seventeen who loves excitement, says exactly
what she thinks and rarely thinks before she says it.
Superficially, in height and figure, she resembles Miriam.
She also weirs glasses. By her gestures we gather she is
speaking urgently, but softly, to her father, who lifts a
weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward Guy in the
hallway, Barbara keeps quiet and also looks toward Guy.
They both wait for him to enter.

Barbara has been squirming in her seat, then as if jet
propelled she catapults out of it and runs to Guy, giving
him a big hug and a smack on the cheek.

Subdued, she sits down.   But Guy remains standing.

<b>                      SENATOR
</b>              (finding it difficult
               to begin)
          There seems to be no way of
          diplomatically breaking tragic news.
          I'm sorry, Guy, to be the one to
          tell you. It concerns your wife.
          She's been murdered.

Guy stares woodenly at the Senator, is if hypnotized.

Slowly Guy's eyes meet hers. They are remembering what he

chair. The Senator is quite distressed.

During the following scene Barbara quietly goes about the

<b>                SENATOR
</b>        (wrylt, to Guy)
    It happened on an island in an
    amusement park. It was sort of a
    lovers lane, I believe. A rather
    sordid atmosphere.

<b>                BARBARA
</b>        (quickly, to Guy)
    Miriam went there with two boys.
    They were the ones who found her.
    So they're not suspects. But you
    probably will be.

<b>                 SENATOR
</b>    Young lady, we can't overlook the
    fact that murder is at our doorsteps.
    But I forbid you to drag it into the
    living room!

<b>                BARBARA
</b>        (wide-eyed)
    Let's not fool ourselves. The police
    will say Guy wanted Miriam out of
    the way so he could marry Anne. In
    a crime of this sort the police first
    go after the husband, and Guy had
    every motive.

<b>                   SENATOR
</b>        (aghast)
    Motive?

<b>                GUY

    She's right. Whichever way you look
    at it...I'm in a spot.

<b>                SENATOR
</b>        (disconcerted but
         whistling in dark)
    Oh come now, my boy. I'm sure you

<b>EXT. METCALF POLICE HEADQUARTERS DAY
</b>
A knot of people are hanging around the entrance, including
a few newspaper photographers. There is a rush of interest
when a taxi pulls up and Guy steps out of it. Guy pushes
his way through the people. Two or three bulbs flash. There
is a murmur from the crowd and we hear Guy's name. He passes
into the entrance.


<b>INT. CORRIDOR OF POLICE HEADQUARTERS

Guy comes into the corridor from the street and approaches
two policemen who are standing nearby.
<b>                      GUY
</b>          Captain Turley's office?

One of the policemen gestures to a door at the right.    Guy
crosses and enters.


<b>INT. RECEPTION ROOM OUTSIDE CAPTAIN TURLEY'S OFFICE
</b>
At one side of the room is a young police sergeant seated at
a typewriter. A group of people are seated in chairs lined
against the opposite wall.

Guy enters, crosses to the sergeant at the desk.

He now has time to take stock of the waiting people.    He
catches his breath when he sees:

He looks about him uncomfortably, then turns suddenly as he
sees:


<b>MED. SHOT

Seated behind Guy, apart from the others who are waiting, is
Professor Collins, Guy's drunken companion on the train of
the night before. The professor is completely sober now,
dignified and erect. He has removed his glasses to polish
them and does not react to Guy's presence.

Guy starts with a smile of recognition to say, "How do you
do?" but at that moment he hears the door open and his name
called:

<b>INT. CAPTAIN TURLEY'S OFFICE
</b>
CAPTAIN TURLEY is conscientious, methodical and always polite.
He puts aside photographs and records and rises from behind
his desk as Guy comes in. A detective lieutenant, CAMPBELL,
is attending a coffee maker. Their expressions are grave by
contrast with Guy's confident attitude after seeing the
professor in the waiting room.

Turley signals to Campbell to call the professor in.

Momentarily Guy is frustrated, then he turns quietly to
Turley.

<b>                      GUY

          Captain, is it so important whether
          or not Professor Collins remember
          me? Surely, the important thing is
          that I've been able to name a man
          who was on the train with me. You've
          been able to find him. Isn't that
          proof of where I was at nine-thirty
          last night?
Guy asks this question with a look of near triumph that he
has clearly established his alibi.

From Bruno's viewpoint, as Barbara speaks,CAMERA MOVES IN
CLOSER until to faintest impression of the merry-go-round
fills the screen with the effect of whirling around Barbara's
head. Her glasses seem to glint until her eyes are
obliterated by the glare.

All talk dies out as all eyes turn to Bruno, who is staring
at Barbara. Except Anne's, who is saying quietly to Bruno:

partially dressed for an evening party, in black bow tie but
without his jacket. He leans forward to take up a letter
from among brown paper wrappings on the table.


<b>INSERT: LETTER
</b>
               Dear Guy --

               Just two more days left. We must
               get together for final details.

The note, in Bruno's handwriting, is unsigned.

He stares down at the note.   At this moment there is a knock
at the door.


<b>MED. SHOT

Guy hastily gather together the gun, the note and the
wrappings and puts them in a dresser drawer. He crosses to
the door and opens it. Hennessy enters, carrying a topcoat.

          That's too bad. Hammond takes over
          in a couple of hours. I'd like to
          see him earn his salary.

Guy turns to the dresser drawer in which he has put the note
and the gun, maneuvering his body between the dresser and
Hennessy's view. He takes out a handkerchief, closes the
drawer, sticks the handkerchief in his pocket, speaking as
he does so.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          Doesn't that bloodhound over relax?
          He sticks so close he's beginning to

</b>              (mildly)
          He thinks you're a very suspicious
          character. He doesn't trust anybody!
          Not even himself.

Guy is eager to get out of the room, and Hennessy is
maddeningly slow in his movements.

Anne and the Senator are still greeting new arrivals. Anne's
manner is somewhat preoccupied. She glances around as she
speaks, as though looking for someone.

We see Guy excuse himself from Barbara, cross to Bruno and
speak to him angrily, obviously asking, "What are you doing
here?" Bruno, however, greets Guy with a smile then turns
from him, unperturbed and bland. He sees Anne and moves
toward her, smiling.


<b>CLOSEUP ANNE
</b>
As Bruno comes in her direction, Anne's expression shows her
mystification and concern about Bruno's presence and about
Guy's attitude toward him.


<b>MED. SHOT
</b>Bruno comes up to Anne and the Senator. He gives a slight
bow to the Senator; then puts his hand out to Anne.

<b>                        BRUNO
</b>            Good evening, Miss Burton.

The Senator looks inquiringly.    Anne makes the introduction.

<b>                        ANNE
</b>            This is Mr. Antony, father.

            Senator, about my idea of harnessing
            the life force. It will make atomic
            power look like the horse and buggy.
                (the Senator and Anne

                 look at him in

Interrupted by new arrivals, Bruno moves away out of the
picture, with a charming smile to Anne.

The Senator greets the new guests with open mouth and simply
shakes their hands while glancing off in direction of the
departing Bruno.

moves on. The Senator turns to Anne.

          must be executed.

<b>                     JUDGE
</b>          So it is. Besides, it doesn't happen
          every day.

At this moment, Anne comes into the scene.    She hesitates as
she hears Bruno's answer.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          So few murderers are caught.

The Judge moves out of the way. Bruno smiles blandly at the
ladies. One of them speaks to him.

<b>                      MRS. CUNNINGHAM
</b>          Well, Mr. Antony, you seem very
          interested in the subject of murder.

Anne looks more troubled, then moves on out of the scene.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          No more than anyone else.   No more
          than you, for instance.

<b>                       MRS. CUNNINGHAM
</b>          Me?   I'm not interested in murder.

Bruno pulls up a chair to face the two woman on the settee,
sits down, straddling the seat, to look at them over the
back of the chair and settle down for a nice conversation.

to the settee. There is a babble of women's voices trying
to explain what has happened.

</b>                 (thru the babble)
             Bring her upstairs.

As the two groups pass off in different directions, the few
people who ran into the scene late are asking the others
what the disturbance is. "What's wrong?" "Did she faint?"
"I didn't see anything." "What happened to him?" "Somebody
hurt?" But one small figure stands in the clear. It is
Barbara, She is still transfixed by what she has seen. Her
hands are trembling. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON HER. We see
that her lips are trembling, too, and in her eyes frightened
tears are welling. Her breath is heavy.


<b>INT. STUDY
</b>
Bruno is stretched out on a settee. He is completely out.
His collar and tie are open. Two or three of the male guests
are just leaving the room. The Senator remains behind for a
moment with Guy.

<b>                         SENATOR
</b>             I thought he was a bit weird when he
             arrived. Who is he?

<b>                         GUY
</b>             I hardly know him, sir.

<b>                         SENATOR
</b>             Get him out of here as soon as you
             decently can -- will you. This is a
             nice item for the gossips. First
             thing you know, they'll be talking
             about orgies. I'd better get back...

<b>                         GUY
</b>             Yes, sir.

The Senator leaves.   Guy stands over Bruno's outstretched
figure.


<b>MEDIUM SHOT
</b>
Bruno is now half awake. Almost without seeing Guy, he
staggers to his feet and begins to make his way to the door.
Guy advances, and with a sharp thrust, pushes Bruno back on
the settee.

Bruno looks and sees Guy clearly for the first time.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          What happened? I was on a merry-go-
          round somewhere. It made me dizzy.

Guy moves forward, and thrusting his hand in Bruno's open
shirt, pulls him to his feet. Bruno ignores Guy's violence
and remain puzzled.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (disgusted)
          You're a mad, crazy maniac, and you
          ought to be locked-up! Now will you
          get out of here and let me alone?

<b>                        BRUNO
</b>          But, Guy --

Guy smashes Bruno in the jaw, in utter disgust, and knocks
him back onto the settee. Bruno looks up from his sprawled
position, a dull look in his eye.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          You shouldn't have done that, Guy.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (subsiding)
          Come on -- pull yourself together.
          Do your tie up.

Bruno staggers to his feet. He fumbles at his collar.    As
he crosses to him, CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSER SHOT.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          Here -- let me.

He fixes Bruno's shirt and collar together and quickly ties
his white bow. Bruno stands swaying like a small boy as Guy
does this.

Bruno and Guy going out the front door. The man-servant

call for Mr. Antony's car.

She turns her head and looks up the stairs. Barbara has not
quite recovered from her ordeal. She hurries forward to
greet Anne who is hurrying down the stairs.

CAMERA PANS DOWN with Anne as she descends the last few steps.
Barbara enters the picture and the two girls meet at the

Anne is extremely concerned and thoughtful. Suddenly she
gets an idea and with a pat on Barbara's arm, asks hurriedly:

</b>           Do you know where Guy is?

Anne comes out onto the steps and looks around.   She stops
short as she sees:

There are cars lined up outside on the street. One limousine
is pulling up in the center, two figures at the passenger
door. One is climbing in. The other is Guy.

Anne comes down the steps and intercepts Guy on the sidewalk.
She leads him along a few paces and then stops and faces
him.

          He stared at her again tonight --
          while his hands were around Mrs.
          Cunningham's throat.

Guy looks at Anne with an expression of growing fear and
alarm. She goes on inexorably:

<b>                      ANNE
</b>          What did Miriam look like, Guy.

<b>                      GUY

<b>                      GUY

Still in his dinner clothes, Guy is seated in deep thought
near the telephone, wrestling with his problem. There is an
open telephone directory in front of him. He comes to a
decision, picks up the telephone and dials a number. He
waits for the answer, then:

He is studying the plan of Bruno's house, and he picks up

watch, then folds the plan and puts it in his pocket with
the key. He rises, crosses to the  chest of drawers, opens
the top drawer.

This is a long flight of steps. Moonlit. They are lined
with tall black cypress trees which throw their shadows across
the steps. Guy moves out of one shadow, into another and
carefully starts up the stairs.

looks straight down at him. Guy turns off the flashlight
and after a moment of indecision starts slowly up the stairs
once more, the dog watching every step he takes.


<b>UPPER HALLWAY

Guy comes up the last few stairs and still the dog hasn't
moved. Guy slowly edges past him and the Great Dane's head
turns to watch him.

The faintest flicker of Bruno's eyes indicates the intensity
of his reaction. He stares hard at Guy.

<b>                       BRUNO
</b>           I see. You won't have any further
           use for the key, then, Mr. Haines.
               (he holds out his
                hand and Guy gives
                him the key)
           Thank you very such.

As Bruno continues to stare at him, Guy takes out the Luger.
For a moment a look of fear comes into Bruno's face as he
thinks Guy will probably shoot him. After a pause, Guy tosses
the gun on the bed.

<b>                       GUY
</b>           Or this.

Bruno's relief turns again to menace.      He picks up the gun
and fingers it nervously.

<b>                        GUY
</b>               (kindly)
           Look, Bruno. You're terribly sick.
               (haltingly)
           I don't know whether it's possible
           for you to realize it or not. I
           don't know much about these things,
           Bruno. But why don't you go someplace
           where you can get some treatment?
           Not only for your own sake, Bruno,
           but you can't go on causing more and
           more destruction to anyone you happen
           to meet.

Bruno pays no attention.     He rises.


<b>TWO SHOT
</b>
Guy's arguments have made no impression on Bruno whatsoever.
He fingers the gun.

<b>                       BRUNO

<b>                        BRUNO (CONT'D)
</b>            I have a murder on my conscience,
            but it's not my murder, Mr. Haines --
            it's yours. And as you're the one
            to profit, I think you should be the
            one to pay for it.

For an instant his nervous hands seem to be struggling with
the urge to kill Guy.

<b>                        GUY
</b>                (gives up)
            Well, I guess it's no use, Bruno.
            We sees to have nothing further to
            discuss.
Bruno goes to the door in silent acquiescence and opens it
for Guy to pass through.


<b>INT. HALLWAY MED. SHOT
</b>
Guy walks toward the stairs, tense and apprehensive. Bruno
is following him, still holding the gun. When the Great
Dane sees Bruno it gets to its feet, as if waiting for a
command.

Guy starts down the stairs but Bruno stays where he is, the
dog beside him. Gay turns and looks back it this tableaux
of menace.

<b>                        BRUNO
</b>            Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot
            you, Mr. Haines. It might disturb
            mother.
                (with a feeling of
                 power)
            I'm a very clever follow. I'll think
            of something better than that. Much
            better.


<b>LONG SHOT
</b>
Bruno remains in the foreground of the scene as Guy proceeds
on down the stairs. We see him open the front door and pass
through.

Hennessy is relieving Hammond who has kept watch on Guy's
apartment night.

<b>                      HAMMOND
</b>              (in the middle of his
               story)
          He came back at three twenty-five.
          I didn't even know he'd given me the
          slip until his 'phone kept ringing
          for about half an hour. Nobody sleeps
          that sound. So I got the janitor to
          let me in. No Haines.
<b>                      HENNESSY
</b>              (to himself)

</b>          We'll probably hear of another dame
          murdered.

<b>                      HENNESSY
</b>              (puzzled)
          Shut up. I'd better contact Metcalf.
          I should think this calls for more
          questioning of Mr. Haines.

<b>                         HAMMOND
</b>          Questioning?     Nuts!   Let's take him
          in.

<b>                      HENNESSY
</b>          My dear Mr. Hamond, how many times
          do I have to tell you that we have
          nothing conclusive on Haines? There's
          no evidence that he was ever at the
          scene of the crime. Can't you get
          that into your thick head?
              (quietly)
          Now stay put till I get back.

</b>
Anne and Mrs. Antony are in the middle of a conversation.
Anne's manner is tense and purposeful, Mrs. Antony's much
less serious.

<b>                       MRS. ANTONY
</b>          Oh, now, Miss Burton, really! I
          know Bruno's been in some very awkward
          scrapes, but nothing so ridiculous
          as a murder.
              (she gives a short
               little laugh)
<b>                      ANNE
</b>              (desperately)
          But, Mrs. Antony, you've got to make
          him do something about this. Don't
          you see that just one word from him
          would extricate Guy from this dreadful
          situation?

<b>                       MRS. ANTONY
</b>               (lightly)
          Oh, but Miss Burton, I'm sure this
          thing must be some practical joke.
          You know, Bruno sometimes goes too
          far.
               (girl to girl)
          Of course I shouldn't be saying this
          to an outsider, but sometimes he's
          terribly irresponsible and gets into
          all kinds of escapades.

<b>                      ANNE

</b>              (she sighs and rises,
               winding it up)
          Well, Miss Burton, it was very nice
          of you to call. You must excuse me
          now. I must get back to my painting.
          Do you care for painting, Miss Burton?
          I find it so soothing.
              (shakes Anne's hand)
          You must come again sometime.

She goes out. Anne is left helpless, standing in the middle
of the room. She picks up her purse and is about to go when
she hears a voice:
<b>                      BRUNO'S VOICE
</b>          Oh, Miss Burton!

Anne turns back in direction of the voice. CAMERA   PULLS
BACK until we can see the feet of Bruno protruding  from behind
a chair in which he is sitting. He has obviously   heard the
entire conversation between Anne and his mother.   Bruno rises.
He is in dressing gown and pajamas.

<b>                       BRUNO
</b>          I'm afraid mother wasn't very helpful,
          was she?
              (he strolls toward
               Anne)
          You know she hasn't been well for a
          long time. She's a little -- how
          shall I say -- confused.
              (shakes his head
               commiseratingly)
          Poor mother.

Anne is too stunned to speak.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          You know, I'm very upset with Guy.
          He shouldn't have sent you on an
          errand like this.

<b>                      ANNE
</b>          Guy doesn't know I'm here, Mr. Antony.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          He's been leading you up the garden
          path, I'm afraid. He must be very
          desperate to try to involve me.
          I've been protecting him ever since
          we had that conversation on the train
          and he told me how he hated his wife.

Bruno is now standing near the   window a little apart from
Anne, with his back to him. He    takes something out of the
pocket of his dressing gown and   looks down at it in his hand.
It is Guy's lighter.  Suddenly   he stuffs it back his pocket
and turn back to Anne.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Why, do you know, Miss Burton, he
          tried to get me to go back to the
          island one night after dark and pick
          up his lighter so the police wouldn't
          find it? He dropped it there, you
          know, when -- well, that night.

Anne's horror is growing.
<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          The whole thing's been worrying me
          so much. But of course I couldn't
          do it, Miss Burton. It would have
          been too risky. And besides, it
          would have made me an accessory.

Anne stares at this insane man and sinks on the settee.   She
starts to cry in sheer frustration. Bruno goes to her
sympathetically.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Miss Burton, I know how you feel.

He puts his hand on her shoulder. Anne flings it off. There
is an awkward pause as Bruno looks down at her. Then he
begins to look around restlessly.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>          Miss Burton, you must excuse me. I
          have an urgent appointment.
              (looks it his watch)
          I must go up and change. Now, I
          really must go...if you'll excuse
          me...

He turns, starts out of the room and up the stairs in the
hall. Anne watches him.

Bruno turns and waves to Anne from the landing, then goes on
up the stairs.

Guy stares at her, takes a quick look toward the stadium,
then gives Anne his full attention.

<b>                      ANNE
</b>          He acted peculiar -- as if he could
          put the murder right in your lap,
          and not involve himself at all.

          Any little thing.

Guy is surrounded by police and Campbell stands at his elbow.
At this moment the boatman runs in. One of the detectives
is with him.

<b>                      DETECTIVE
</b>          Mr. Turley! Mr. Turley!
              (indicating boatman)
          He says this isn't the man we want.
              (with a nod in Guy's
               direction)
          It's the other one -- the one he was
          fighting with.

<b>                        TURLEY
</b>                (stops to give his
                 full attention to
                 this unexpected bit
                 of information)
          What   do you mean, this isn't the --
                (turns to Guy, not
                 quite taking it in)
          Not   Haines?
                (back to boatman)
          But   you said he was. You pointed
          him   out.

<b>                      BOATMAN
</b>          No, I didn't, sir. I've never seen
          this man before in my life. I meant
          the other one.

The detective who was holding Guy instinctively relax his
hold on Guy's arm. Turley turns to Guy, puzzled.

<b>                      TURLEY
</b>          What is this all about, Haines?        Did
          you know he killed your wife?

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (nods)
          He has my cigarette   lighter and wanted
          to plant it there on   the island to
          pin the whole thing   on me.
              (urgently)
          Let me talk to him.      Let me show
          you. Where is he?

<b>                        ANOTHER DETECTIVE
</b>          Over here.

He leads the way.   They follow.

<b>MED. CLOSE SHOT
</b>
as Guy and Turley enter to the  spot where Bruno is pinned
under the overturned machine.   He is caught between two of
the horses, the head of one of  them across his chest. Bruno's
head sags back somewhat, but is  resting on pieces of debris.
A uniformed policeman looks up  from Bruno to Turley:

<b>                      POLICEMAN
</b>          This one's in a pretty bad way, Mr.
          Turley.

Guy is shocked at the sight of Bruno.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (looking down at Bruno)
          Can't you get that stuff off him?

<b>                      POLICEMAN
</b>          No, they've done everything they can
          until the crane comes.

Bruno opens his eyes and sees Guy.

<b>                        BRUNO
</b>          Hello, Guy.

Turley has leaned forward to look at the helpless Bruno.

<b>                       BRUNO
</b>              (weakly nodding at
               Turley)
          Who's that?

<b>                      GUY
</b>          This is Mr. Turley, Chief of Police.

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (with a half smile)
          So they got you at last, eh, Guy?

Guy looks around desperately, frustrated for a moment as
Turley eyes him stonily. Then he turns again to Bruno.

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (rather gently)
          Can you talk a little? Can you tell
          the chief you have my lighter?

<b>                      BRUNO
</b>              (with a faint,
               quizzical smile)
          I haven't got it. It's still on the
          island where you left it.

Guy looks around helplessly to Turley, who looks back at him
suspiciously.

<b>                      DETECTIVE
</b>              (looking down at Bruno)
          I think he's going.

Turley leans over to look.

<b>CLOSE SHOT BRUNO'S FIST FROM TURLEY'S VIEWPOINT
</b>
As Bruno is dying, his closed fist slowly starts to open.

<b>                      DETECTIVE'S VOICE
</b>          He's finished.

Guy's lighter is now revealed in Bruno's open hand.


<b>MED. SHOT GROUP
</b>
Turley takes the lighter from the dead Bruno's hand. Guy is
watching him. Turley straightens up and holds the lighter
out to him.

<b>                      TURLEY
</b>          Is this your lighter, Haines?

Guy nods without speaking, and with a half look in Bruno's
direction.

<b>                      TURLEY
</b>          Well, you were right.
              (sticks the lighter
               into his own pocket)
          I'd better keep this for the time
          being.
              (in a friendly tone)
          We can clear the whole thing out the
          morning. How about staying in town
          over night, Haines? I imagine you
          have a lot to tell me. Nine o'clock,
          all right?

<b>                      GUY
</b>              (nods)
          Okay, Mr. Turley.   Thanks.

Turley turns back to the group around Bruno. Guy looks down
for a moment at Bruno, then speaks to the boatman, who is
standing nearby.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          Can you tell me where there's a
          telephone?

<b>                      BOATMAN
</b>              (indicating)
          There's one up near the entrance.
              (with a look back to
               the dead Bruno)
          Who was he, Bud?

Guy looks back sympathetically in Bruno's direction, speaks
without looking at the boatman.

<b>                      GUY
</b>          Bruno. Bruno Antony.
              (reminiscently and a
               little
               compassionately,
               remembering what
               Bruno had said of
               himself)
          A very clever fellow.

He moves off through the crowd.

<b>INT. BURTON STUDY NIGHT
</b>
Anne, Barbara and the Senator are sitting silently in the
attitudes of waiting. The telephone rings. Anne is instantly
on her feet. Barbara and the Senator watch her anxiously as
she goes to answer it.

<b>                       ANNE
</b>               (into phone)
          Hello...
               (impatiently)

<b>                      ANNE (CONT'D)
</b>              (a pause, then she
               closes her eyes with
               heartfelt relief.
               Another pause, then:)
          Yes, darling, yes. Of course I'll
          be there...Goodbye.

She hangs up, turns slowly, to face Barbara and her father.
Her expression is one of intense relief.

<b>                      ANNE
</b>          Guy'll be back tomorrow.
              (overcome with emotion
               she has difficulty
               in speaking)
          He wants me to take him some things.

With a sob, Barbara flings herself into Anne's arms. As she
cries, Anne strokes her head comfortingly. Then with a half-
choked sobs Anne, too, begins to cry. She speaks through
her tears, looking over Barbara's shoulder at her father.

<b>                      ANNE
</b>          He says he looks silly in his tennis
          clothes.

The Senator eyes them a moment, then speaks a little wryly:

<b>                      SENATOR
</b>          I presume from all those tears that
          you have had good news.

<b>INT. PARLOR OF TRAIN NEXT DAY
</b>
Anne and Guy are sitting quietly together. Opposite them is
a man in a clerical collar who is reading a sports magazine.
On the cover is a picture of a tennis player in action. The
man looks over the top of his magazine at Guy, with
recognition. He leans forward.

<b>                      CLERIC
</b>          I beg your pardon, but aren't you

          Yes.

Guy and Anne exchange a  brief look, rise hurriedly and start
to walk away before the  conversation can go any farther.
The cleric looks after  them with a frown and a puzzled shrug
of his shoulders, as if  to say, "Did I  say something wrong?"
