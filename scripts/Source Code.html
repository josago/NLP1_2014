          A SOUND slowly builds: the rhythmic rocking of a TRAIN'S
          WHEELS over RAILROAD TRACKS...

<b>          INT. HIGH SPEED TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
          COLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face.
          He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented.
          Slowly he turns his head to one side...
          PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on
          their morning commute into a city.
          Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees
          flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic
          strobe pattern.
          Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A
          disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin
          burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.
          His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually
          wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.
          Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down
          shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.
          It reads 7:40 a.m.
          He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.
          He has no idea where he is.

<b>          EXT. NEW JERSEY COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING
</b>
          The train hurls straight at us.
          NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and
          turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it.
          Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely
          seems to touch. They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer HUM.

          Colter hasn't moved. By his side he sees a canvas MESSENGER
          BAG. Is that his?
          Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A
          red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather
          NAME TAG reads: "SEAN FENTRESS."�
          It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is
          starting to freak him out.
          He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with
          a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE.
          CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of
          soda.
          Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late
          twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits
          around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail
          polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button-
          down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and-
          bones cufflinks. She's busy writing in a journal.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Ma'am?
          Nothing.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Excuse me... ma'am?
          She looks up. Blank stare.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What is this?

<b>                         CHRISTINA

</b>          (looks out the window)
          Almost at Newark.
          Goes back to her journal.

</b>          It's more of a hell hole.
          But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea
          slams into him. He hangs on to the seat.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Woah.

<b>                         (BEAT)

</b>          (gestures, alarmed)
          Okay, bathroom's that way.
          Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Go. Seriously.
          Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length
          of the car until he finds the RESTROOM.
          The door is LOCKED. The latch reads "OCCUPIED."�
          Bracing himself, he lurches forward into...

<b>          INT. TRAIN - SECOND CAR - MORNING
</b>
          He freezes. It's a mirror image of the first car. But no,
          the passengers are different.
          Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom,
          he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT. A
          cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors.

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          Ticket?
          A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of
          keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed.

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          May I see your ticket?
          The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his
          pockets.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I don't think I...

<b>                         CONDUCTOR

          He pulls out a citation pad.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Is this...?
          From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The
          conductor snips his ticket and brushes past.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it
          here. Where's this train headed?

<b>                         CONDUCTOR

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          New York?
          Why would he be going to New York? How can this be
          happening? Fear starts to grip him as the hallucination
          simply continues.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Do you know where I got on?
          The conductor examines his ticket again.

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          Princeton Junction.

<b>                         COLTER

          waking up or buying a ticket or
          getting on the train or anything
          else. It's just a blank.

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          Lucky you.
          The jaded conductor moves on. Colter is alone with his
          confusion. Takes a deep breath. The nausea has eased
          slightly.

</b>
          Entering the first car again. The rows of passengers. Must
          be at least forty people.
          As he walks back up the aisle, he looks from face to face:
          A pale COMPUTER ENGINEER reviews some documents.
          A forty-something SECRETARY does a crossword puzzle.
          DEREK, a stock broker type, talks on his cell phone:

<b>                         DEREK
</b>          Trust me, by one o'clock, the
          bridge is going to be jammed...
          A COLLEGE STUDENT, slumped against a window, eyes shut,
          listens to an MP-3 player.
          An OLD MAN with a faded wool suit clutches a cane.
          A BACKPACKER, female, European, 20s, hiking boots, examines a
          guidebook.
          A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons into a
          tabbed file box.
          An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper.
          None of them pays any attention to Colter.
          A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to
          An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister.
          Like the exhalations of a creature.
          A SCRAPE. He looks to see
          A woman FILING HER NAILS.
          Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression seems
          heightened, near the point of overload.
          He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across
          from her. She writes in her journal, ignoring him.

</b>          There's something else in his sports coat. A WALLET. He
          turns it over a few times, inspecting it. Pulls out a
          DRIVER'S LICENSE. Another man's face is in the photo. The
          name on the license reads: "SEAN FENTRESS."� The same name as
          on the messenger bag. The street address on the license
          reads: "58 Alexander Road, Princeton Junction, New Jersey."�

          And why does he have this guy's wallet? He leans forward to
          speak with Christina again.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Ma'am?
          She lowers her journal, annoyed. We see she hasn't been
          writing but DRAWING. A well-executed sketch of a face.

          So did I. Unfortunately, I

          The mirror? She goes back to her sketchbook. Determined not
          to be interrupted again. Anxiety ripples through Colter.

<b>                         COLTER

          disembark onto the platform: Derek, the Old Man, the College
          Kid and GUZMAN, a Middle Eastern man, who HURRIES past all of

          A fluorescent light flutters on as Colter shuts the door.
          He's in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in
          stainless steel.
          He SHOUTS in surprise. Recoils backwards. Eyes locked on

<b>                         THE MIRROR

          obliging him to hang on.
          This isn't a dream. At least not one he can wake up from.
          The other guy's face stares back at him. Blinks when he
          blinks.

          From her seat, Christina stares at the messenger bag which
          Colter left behind. Then up at the closed restroom door.

          The car rocks to one side as an EXPRESS TRAIN flashes by on

          On the verge of opening the door, Colter hears a METALLIC
          RATTLING. Two SCREWS are rattling around in the sink.
          Colter picks up a screw. Turns it over and over in his hand.
          What are they doing in the sink?
          He looks UP.
          An overhead VENTILATION PANEL has been PRIED OPEN. Above it

          Moving carefully in the tiny space, he stands up on the

          On the rowhouses, a ALUMINUM DOOR MOLDINGS begin to MELT in

          One of the FREIGHT CARS, loaded down with coal, shuddering

          The machinery HUM changes modulation. Then gives way to a

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter opens his eyes...
          SUNLIGHT hits his face. In flickering patterns. He turns to

<b>                         LOOK OUT
</b>
<b>          A TRAIN WINDOW
</b>          At the passing woodland scenery.
          He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat.
          Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad.
          Just like before. Other commuters all around him.
          Everything is exactly the same as before.
          Note: The remaining story will follow this "binary pattern."�
          Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule.
          Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from,
          the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of
          steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers,
          the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a
          buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the
          window, bursting with summer leaves.
          Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the
          same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40
          a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in
          the canvas messenger bag beside him...
          This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger
          bag. The books are stamped "NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY."�
          He also takes out the APPLE. Sniffs it. Takes a bit. It's
          good. No, it's awesome. Crisp and delicious.

          Colter moves on. He looks for suspects. We've seen the
          faces before -- the Computer Engineer, the Secretary, the
          Stock Broker, the Backpacker and so on.
          All seems normal. He finds himself focusing on a jumble of
          unfiltered details -- Suits. Ties. Shoes. Skirts.
          Watches. Newspapers. Coffee cups. Litter.
          Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory
          details slam into him. We go EXTREMELY CLOSE ON:
          The STITCHING on a leather purse.
          A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray.
          AIR CONDITIONING hissing from a vent.
          A CRUMPLING SOUND as the Overweight Man crushes an empty soda
          can.
          TAP, TAP, TAP -- the Computer Engineer tapping his foot on
          the floor. Faster and faster.
          Derek, the Wall Street Type, talks on his phone:

          man, emerges. After a furtive glance around, he quickly
          takes a seat.
          Now Colter makes the connection. The bomb in the restroom.
          The Middle Eastern man emerging from the same restroom.
          Colter starts down the long aisle.
          In his seat, Guzman slips on dark glasses. He looks
          forbidding with his mustache and olive-colored skin.

<b>                         COLTER

          Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed. Behind his dark
          glasses, Guzman ignores him, but he's visibly uncomfortable.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What's your name?
          Guzman is stock still. Beads of sweat on his forehead. The
          conductor appears, accosting Colter.

<b>                         CONDUCTOR

          Appealing to Goodwin's invisible presence. But nothing

<b>                         CONDUCTOR
</b>          Who are you talking to?
          An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's
          about to retort, about to accuse Guzman, when he stops.
          It's too easy.
          Colter senses the uproar he's about to create. Which just
          might be a mistake. He reconsiders.

<b>                         COLTER

</b>          Okay. I'm sitting down.
          Turning away, he finds a seat. He studies Guzman out of the
          corner of his eye.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

          Newark Station, next stop.
          The train begins to slow down.
          Several rows up, he sees Christina. She looks back at him
          with distaste.
          A small number of passengers get up, among them the College
          Student. He catches Colter's attention as he picks up a
          WALLET from a seat and catches up with Derek, the Stock
          Broker, who's about to get off the train.

<b>                         COLLEGE STUDENT

          The College Student waits to get off. Colter now eyes him
          closely.
          As the train pulls to a stop, Guzman forcefully pushes
          forward towards the doors, moving with a barely contained
          urgency.

          Just before the doors close, Colter steps out onto the
          platform. Eyes locked on Guzman -- who disappears inside the
          station house.
          The train PULLS OFF, leaving Colter behind. Did he make the
          right move?
          As he goes to pursue Guzman, Colter is struck by more sensory

<b>                         IMPRESSIONS:
</b>          The STATION CLOCK. Its digital numerals flash 7:50 a.m.,

          The dying HISS of the rails as the train recedes down the
          track.
          The super-sharp glint of a PENNY embedded down in the gravel
          of the tracks.
          The melancholy SIGH of trees in the wind.
          Pushing it all aside, he hurries after Guzman.

          College Kid mills around the newspaper stand.
          A muffled COUGH.
          Colter spins. Sees a door marked "MEN'S ROOM."�

<b>          INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING

          Pushing open the door, Colter discovers a row of 1930's-era
          sinks and stalls. An intercom crackles to life:

          Colter's footsteps echo down the length of the deserted men's
          room. The last stall door is SHUT.
          From within the closed stall, comes the sound of VOMITING.
          Colter edges closer.
          A toilet FLUSHES. Guzman emerges from the stall. Looks
          awful. Freezes when he sees Colter.

          face, not Colter's. Guzman does not seem to notice this
          disparity. He picks up his briefcase and briskly walks out.
          Colter takes an uneasy look at Fentress looking back at him
          in the mirror, then follows Guzman out.

<b>          INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING

          The STATION CLOCK reads 7:54 a.m.
          Colter looks down at HIS WATCH: THREE MINUTES remaining.
          What will Guzman do?
          Guzman glances over at Colter, then heads through the doors
          and back out on the train platform.

          The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN
          of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching.

          WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending
          Guzman sprawling to the ground.
          Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The
          simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again.
          Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside
          is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and
          photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil.

          Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS.
          Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He
          triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back.
          Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and
          malice.

          The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down
          the tracks, is the RISING PLUME of a HUGE EXPLOSION.
          Colter looks back at Guzman in shock. Then down at Guzman's
          cell phone. Which has remained off.

          THE PATH OF THE ON-COMING EXPRESS TRAIN -- with a blast of
          its horn, THE TRAIN RUNS HIM OVER.
          Everything stops.
          Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world
          itself BLISTERS AND BURNS INTO SEARING WHITE... into
          smothering, forgetful SILENCE...

          Colter opens his eyes. He's back in his military flight
          suit.
          The craft goes still. Cautiously, he releases his hands from
          their grip on the seat restraints. He looks like he's

          malfunctioning. It flickers on and off, revealing Colter's
          face in and out of darkness.

</b>          The capsule is nearly shut down. The controls appear non-
          functional. Ice crystals have formed over the circuitry.
          Colter hugs himself, shivering. His breath is visible in the
          capsule's tomb-like cold.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin? What's happening? Come
          in. Can you read me? It's goddamn
          cold in here.
          He hits a few buttons. Almost at random. The VENTS which
          had been blowing in air FALL SILENT.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen.
          The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin!
          It's now COMPLETELY DARK.
          He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump.
          A terrifying silence.
          The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to
          the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing
          around. Then...
          The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's
          activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It
          begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in
          the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule.
          Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT
          HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS...
          But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed.
          He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is
          incredibly cramped.
          Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS
          in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS.
          He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he
          BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the
          hull.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          44.
</b>          So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft.
          At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry.
          Daunted by the complexity.
          There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he
          begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow
          and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out
          of his hands.

<b>                         LATER
</b>          Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice
          crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of
          the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed.
          Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of
          BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Come on!
          Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke.
          He's burned his fingers.
          But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT.
          Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads
          on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint
          electric HUM.
          FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws
          the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the
          craft.
          Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,
          a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on:

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          -- four principle dialects of
          Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-
          Lebanese and North African. We
          will now play you portions of each,
          discussing the audible differences
          between them.
          CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play.
          Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor
          fills with scrolling lines of COMPUTER CODE.
          With an oddly low-tech CLANG, the heart of the machine
          reawakens. The air vents come back to life. Heat starts to
          return. The icicles begin to DRIP.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          45.
</b>          Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work.
          The monitor switches to a real-time view of the LAB.
          Goodwin's chair is there, but Goodwin is not in sight. In a
          background distorted by the FISH-EYE LENS, various
          technicians wander by.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Hello? Anyone out there? It's me.
          He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up.
          Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of
          another world.
          It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist
          whom Colter glimpsed once before. He will be known as

<b>          RUTLEDGE.
</b>
<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Can you hear me?
          Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for
          a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I'm here! I'm okay!
          Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Is someone there?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Yeah. It's me. Colter.
          Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Wow! It's you.

<b>                         COLTER

<b>                         RUTLEDGE

          (lights his pipe)
          Don't tell them you saw me smoking
          in here, okay?
          His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the
          military environment. And then it occurs to Colter:

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You're the inventor of this thing.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>
<b>                         (SHRUGS)

          And sorry for all the secrecy.
          Goodwin will be thrilled you re-
          established contact.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I don't want to deal with Goodwin
          anymore.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          What?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Don't you understand? He's
          torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't
          you get me out of here?
          Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to
          deal with personnel issues.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Why would Goodwin have it in for

<b>          47.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          He's a remote operator. And remote
          operators are risk averse pussies
          who sit at control screens in the
          rear while actual pilots like me
          put their asses on the line in the
          field.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          He seems pretty devoted to the
          mission.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          And just what kind of mission is
          this? Talk to me, man. Why won't
          he let me save those people on the
          train?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Because they can't be saved.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Why not? I know what's going to
          happen. I could take apart the
          bomb. Stop the train.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Yeah but you'd be doing it in the
          Source Code, not here. Not in our
          own past.
          Mystery upon mystery.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What's the difference?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          I'm not sure I should be telling
          you this.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Telling me what?
          Coaxing the scientist in him.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          It's quantum physics. Linear
          algebra. Parabolic calculus. It
          would take weeks to explain.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Is Source Code time travel?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          48.
</b>          Rutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          It's gone out again.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Why can't I save those people on
          the train?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Think of it like this: events in
          our past can never be undone.
          Einstein proved that.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          So...

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          So Source Code opens up another
          past for you. A parallel past. It
          looks the same but it has no
          intersection with our own world.
          In essence, by sending you back, an
          entirely new but utterly parallel
          world is created. It looks
          identical to ours, but nothing you
          do there has any effect on this
          reality.
          At last some useful information. Colter races to process it.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          What happens to the Source Code
          world after I leave it?

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          I don't know. You can never know
          that because you're not there to
          observe it. Maybe it vanishes.
          Maybe not.

<b>                         (UNEASY)

<b>                         COLTER

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          What bicycle?

<b>                         COLTER

          One more thing to puzzle him.
          The call connects. An OLDER MAN, DONALD STEVENS, answers.
          The gravelly voice of a Midwestern farmer.

          Challenged, he redials. Braced for conflict. The call
          connects.

<b>                         COLTER

          Troubled, he hands back her phone. Outside, the EXPRESS

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          I don't know how to help you.
          She feels bad for him. And something inside Colter closes.
          Retreating inside himself.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Sorry to have bothered you.
          He gets up to go. Christina stays where she is.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING
</b>
          Back in his seat. Lost in the view out the window. The
          neighborhoods have given way to Newark's industrial fringe.
          Bringing him closer to the inevitable end.

<b>          CHRISTINA (V.O.)

</b>          She works at the New York Times.
          Her name's Stephanie. She's just a

          made a reporter. She's always
          saying she needs a good story to
          bring in so she gets noticed.
          Something like this, with a crazy
          paranoid angle could really
          interest her.

          She's already quite suspicious of
          the government.
          Christina's dialing her phone. Colter turns back to the
          window.

          Steph, it's Christina. You know
          that story you're always looking to
          write? I might just have something
          for you. I met a guy. His name is
          Colter Stevens. He says he's in
          the army. He flies helicopters in
          Iraq, but now they've put him into
          a secret project called Source
          Code. Maybe you can look into it a
          bit, okay? Call me.
          She hangs up. Pleased with herself.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          She'll call back. Just wait.
          None of it will do Colter any good, but he manages a smile.

<b>                         COLTER

          He gives her a wary look. Considers.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Twenty five?
          She smiles, pleased.

          know that?
          Colter looks away. Careful.

          tell me everything about this?

<b>          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
          Colter enters the tiny space. Christina is reluctant to
          follow him into the bathroom.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You said you wanted to know.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Can't you just tell me?
          He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in
          next to him.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Try anything and I'll kill you.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Shut the door.
          As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          What are you doing?
          He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          It's up here.
          He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the
          sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the
          crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest
          of the way.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          (startled, feels his hands

</b>          What are you --

<b>                         COLTER

          Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat
          as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb.

</b>          Did you put this here?

<b>                         COLTER

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          The bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away.
          Mounting fear. Colter falls into step behind her.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          It won't matter. The train's

<b>                         COLTER

          Colter looks outside. Recognizes the terrain. Looks down at

<b>          HIS WATCH --
</b>
<b>          50 SECONDS.

          Tears open the door. Jumps up on the sink.

<b>                         THE BOMB

          down, he see Christina standing in the doorway.

          She stops. Not wanting to go on.
          From outside comes the HORN from the approaching freight
          train.

          In his hand, the CELL PHONE RINGS. Colter's eyes light up in
          amazement -- the DISPLAY SCREEN is showing the name and
          number of the bomber. But before he can read what's there,
          Christina's voice finds its way to the back of his brain:

          static. Flying behind the array come LINES OF COMPUTER CODE -
          - the Source Code architecture laid bare.
          And then the screen itself seems to melt, giving way to a

          holes -- the horizon tilting as the helicopter PLUNGES
          towards earth amid a chaos of RADIO TRANSMISSIONS:
          "...taking a lot of RPG fire... be advised A61 is going
          down... A61 is going down hard..."�

<b>          EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
          Black smoke. Boots crunching on sand as we are borne,
          P.O.V., a victim on a jostling stretcher.

<b>          INT. MEDIVAC HELICOPTER - DAY

          Airborne again. The thud of rotors. Through blurred vision
          we see medics working furiously to save a life.

<b>          INT. C5 TRANSPORT JET - DAY
</b>
          The smooth, glassy calm of 30,000 feet. The regular
          pulsations of a VENTILATOR. Fluids drip down through an IV
          bag. Tubes and monitors stacked all around us. Gurneys of
          other wounded packed together. The grumble of another,
          unseen wounded soldier:

<b>          SOLDIER (O.S.)

          projector. The Jack of Clubs.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Captain...?
          The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then
          dissolves.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Captain, allow me to introduce

          Lines of computer code flit across the screen. A blinking
          cursor.

<b>          FADE TO BLACK.
</b>          A tiny APERTURE opens... revealing CHRISTINA. And the
          bicycle. And the stone wall. The strange, recurring vision.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)

</b>
<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Captain, just tell me what you see.
          Just look and speak.
          Groggy breathing. A ragged voice:

<b>          COLTER (V.O.)
</b>          I see a card.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Very good. Very, very good.

</b>
          On Colter's face. A deep, cold knot in his stomach.
          Shuddering in fear. The truth before him now. Crouching
          there, a nightmare, ruling over him.
          On the MONITOR, Goodwin looks into the camera. Assessing the
          situation.

          Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing
          entirely from existence.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Do you need to urinate?
          Colter swallows. Too terrorized to speak.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Beleaguered Castle is waiting for
          your report.
          Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard. Impatient. He flips
          a switch. A blocky COMPUTER VOICE, something out of the
          1970s, comes on:

          The tones cease. Colter remains impassive and inert.

</b>          Captain, I know you can hear me.
          Did you find the bomber?
          Goodwin keys in some commands. Forever adjusting.

</b>          Memory Thread One: "When Lily woke,
          she had the bed to herself. She
          sat up, bewildered by the
          strangeness of her surroundings;
          then memory returned, and she
          looked about her with a shiver."�
          Goodwin stops the audio.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          As you're collecting your thoughts,
          I should tell you there's been
          another development. A terrorist

          it to central Asia.

<b>          ON THE MONITOR
</b>          A grainy VIDEO shows an arid, wind-swept plateau of a far-
          away desert. It is twilight. A MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER, his face
          hidden by a hooded cloak, sits cross legged before a
          flickering camp fire and a tea service.
          The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade
          launcher, and approaches the camera. The wind whips his
          black robes. The figure looks slight. Almost spectral. It
          begins speaking to the camera.

<b>                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER

<b>                         ENGLISH)
</b>          By now you have suffered a taste of
          divine vengeance. God willing, you
          will soon suffer another.
          Colter does not raise his head. No idea whether he's even
          listening.

<b>                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER
</b>          These attacks will show you that
          you will never be safe. You can
          secure your borders. But what can
          you do against one of your own
          citizens? One who looks like you,
          who is blameless, living already
          among you, who takes eighty million
          of our dollars, a trifle, and
          carries out our bidding? You
          cannot stop this. Time has run
          out.
          The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of
          Goodwin.

          later date.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Will you let me out of here?
          Goodwin ignore the question. Continues making notations.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Frankly, Captain, we're
          disappointed.

<b>                         COLTER

<b>                         GOODWIN

          from you.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Stop! Stop reading from your
          goddamn script!

<b>                         GOODWIN

          abilities.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I swear to fucking Christ!

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Please accept the criticism in the
          spirit it was given. Perhaps a few
          memory exercises would help.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          I don't need your criticism and I
          don't need your memory exercises,
          you gutless freak. And by the way,
          that bomb is detonated by a cell
          phone. When activated, the phone's
          display screen displays caller ID
          information. Caller ID. I wonder
          if that information would be useful
          to Beleaguered Castle.
          For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown. But the mask of
          the cold clinician goes back up.

          information.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You'll have to send me back. I
          didn't get a good look at it. But
          I will next time.
          Goodwin hesitates. Skeptical.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          What assurance do we have you'll be
          able to read the screen before the
          device detonates?

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin, there's no time left.
          Send... me... back.
          Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor. His eyes
          are unblinking. Unfeeling. Nothing behind them.

<b>          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter prowls the aisle feverishly. He scans the overhead
          luggage rack. Peeks inside a bag. Doesn't see what he
          wants. He looks all around... up the rows of passengers...
          intently scanning...
          There. The Computer Engineer. He's asleep. But clutched in

          Computer Engineer notices that his cell phone has vanished.
          Across the aisle, a LATINA OFFICE MANAGER taps him on the
          arm. She gestures down the aisle to

          People turn to look. Among them is Christina. Colter just

          PAN OVER to the DOOR of the CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT as it

<b>          CLICKS SHUT.

          about to use the cell phone when sees
          THE CONDUCTOR and a TRAIN OFFICIAL
          Looking over at him in surprise.

<b>                         COLTER

          other way.

</b>          All aboard. Doors are closing.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Don't you understand? I'm in it,
          Goodwin. I'm calling you from
          inside the mission. Inside the
          Source Code.
          A beat of stunned silence. The train begins moving.

<b>          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>          Next stop New York Penn Station.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          This contact is ill-advised. I
          must ask you to hang up.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Goodwin, I'm trapped in this and I
          can't get out.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          You have no authorization to be
          making this call. Goodbye.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          No! Wait! Don't hang up! Forget
          authorization. There's no time.
          Soon you're going to find out what
          happened on this train. And then
          your own day is going to start.
          But not until then. Right now it's
          just you and me talking. And
          you're a different Goodwin than the
          one I'm going to go back to in a
          few minutes. You're separate from
          him. Separate worlds. Do you
          understand?

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          I think so.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Good. Now there's a lot of secrecy

</b>          Jesus, Goodwin, how can I get

          you've got to know that this is
          wrong. Source Code is wrong. And
          if you can't grasp that, if you
          just follow orders, then you're
          just as much a prisoner as I am.
          The car SHUDDERS as the EXPRESS TRAIN FLASHES BY. Quiet
          returns as it recedes.

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          What's your question?
          Surprised, Colter raises his head. Draws a breath.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Did I survive that helicopter crash
          in Iraq?
          Silence. Colter shuts his eyes.

</b>          Answer me. Did I survive that

</b>          How?

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Imagine a turntable. With a record
          spinning on it. All we do is lift
          up the needle. The music stops.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          And then what?

<b>          GOODWIN (V.O.)
</b>          Then we wait. Until another
          mission. And the needle comes down
          again. You won't remember any of
          this. We'll start with the playing

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Does that make it any less wrong?
          No answer. Colter looks down at his watch. Time is running
          out. And there's absolutely nothing he can do.

          Its appearance has altered slightly, given Colter's new

          Rutledge's face goes red. Quite possibly no one has ever
          spoken to him like this before. After a sputtering pause,
          Rutledge's mouth hardens.

          the other way into the next car. No one there.
          Once more he examines the exit area. Gets down on his knees.
          Then he spots it -- an OPENING between the floor and one of
          the wall panels, only a few inches high.
          And there something lies. Colter slides it out.
          Derek's WALLET. Intentionally left here. The same wallet
          the College Kid gave back to Derek earlier.

          She sees Colter down in the exit area. They lock eyes.
          And somehow she knows. He made the call. Colter quickly
          disappears into the other car.

          Christina is not there. Concerned, walking quickly forward,
          Colter looks through the windows...
          And finds her staring back at him. Still on the train. A
          strange moment between the two of them.
          Once again he's failed to save her.
          They watch each other for as long as possible, until the
          train pulls away.

          decent man, terrorized.
          It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy?
          A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman
          emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him.

<b>                         COLTER

          Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are

          Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly
          evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood. Then calmly
          walks out.
          As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on
          his beeping WATCH --
          Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world

          THE STONE WALL now curves over our heads, becoming a TUNNEL.
          CHRISTINA walks away from us -- down into the tunnel. The
          far end is ablaze in WHITE LIGHT.
          We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She
          continues towards the light... and we do not follow.

</b>          The Army investigated Colter's
          helicopter crash in Iraq.
          Apparently he stayed behind to fly
          protective cover for a disabled
          convoy until he ran out of fuel.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE

          flying?

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          No. It's the Silver Star.
          Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's
          breezy good humor.

          acquainting him with the citation
          in case the memory wipe isn't

          die.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          I know, I know. But now the
          Director of National Intelligence
          is sure to want a closer look at
          our program, and until we train up
          another candidate, we'll need to
          keep Colter around to demonstrate
          it.

</b>          Oh.

          Colter's memories and re-initialize
          Source Code.
          Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of
          disgust. Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the
          envelope.

          takes a seat at his workstation. He swings a microphone up

          An odd sensation comes over Colter.

          alterations, here and there, a
          phone call, say, those might slip
          through. We didn't know for sure.
          But you proved it.
          Colter is thunderstruck. Unable to grasp it.

          Goodwin interrupts his preparation for a last look at Colter.
          The noise gets louder. The capsule begins to shake.
          Colter touches the monitor. His fingers imparting to the

          As he nears the other end of the platform, MORE OFFICERS

          looks in at Colter, still on the train. They stare at one

</b>          You can't just expect someone to
          change her life just like that. At
          the very least... you'd have to buy
          that person coffee and explain your
          reasons.
          She waits for his response. Uneasy at putting herself out
          there.
          Colter's watch ticks down to the final seconds. His last
          moments in this world. He has only time enough for a final
          look of reassurance.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          Maybe some other time.
          Disappointment flickers on her face. She turns to go.
          Behind her is a STONE WALL. A BICYCLE is parked against it.
          Colter's breath catches in his throat. This is it! This is
          the mysterious scene he's been seeing!
          HIS WATCH - Hits ZERO.

<b>          INT. BUNKER ICU - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY
</b>
          THE DIGITAL TIMER - Also hits ZERO.
          The outer door OPENS. Rutledge RUSHES in, accompanied by
          MPs.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Arrest him!
          Goodwin backs away from the gurney, hands in the air.
          The BEEPING has given way to a MONOTONE. All of Colter's
          vital signs have FLATLINED.

</b>
<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          He's dying...!
          Rutledge frantically goes to reconnect the machines -- but
          Goodwin has turned off too many of them.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          Get a medical team in here! Move!
          But the MPs just stare at the appalling sight of Colter's
          exposed brain.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>
<b>                         (SHRIEKING)
</b>          What are you standing there for?!
          Do it! We can save him!!!
          No one moves. Rutledge rashly grabs for one of the MP's
          rifles.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          I guess force is the only thing you
          people understa --

<b>                         MP
</b>          Back away, sir, now!
          The MP has leveled his rifle at Rutledge. Who steps back,
          aghast. His authority has vanished with Colter's life.
          Goodwin shuts off the monitors. Silence fills the room.
          Colter is dead.
          Rutledge stares sorrowfully at Colter's body. Then at
          Goodwin with burning hatred.

<b>                         RUTLEDGE
</b>          You're a murderer.
          Goodwin offers his hands to the MP.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          Go ahead and arrest me.
          But the MP does nothing.

<b>                         GOODWIN
</b>          I'll be around. Whenever you want
          me.
          They part as he walks out of the room. A look of grim
          satisfaction on his face.

<b>          EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING
</b>
          Christina walks past the bicycle parked against the stone
          wall. She's about to enter a TUNNEL that goes under the
          tracks. The same tunnel from Colter's vision.
          She stops. Something tells her to turn around.
          The bench where Colter sat is empty.
          But three feet away... Colter is standing there. Still here.
          Dumbfounded, he looks at his watch -- it remains at ZERO.
          He looks all around. Trees stirring in the breeze. A bird
          flies overhead. The crowd of passengers outside the station.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          You okay?
          Colter turns to her. How can this be? He's afraid to even
          speak. As if that alone could break the enchantment.
          But the world is here. It goes on. That's all he knows.
          Finally he swallows. Finding his voice.

<b>                         COLTER
</b>          You're right. The least I can do
          is buy you coffee.
          This pleases Christina, although she tries not to show it.

<b>                         CHRISTINA
</b>          Okay, well, come on then.
          Walking forward, he joins her. The two of them disappear
          down the tunnel.
          A beautiful morning.

<b>          FADE OUT.
</b>
