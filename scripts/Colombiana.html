          CATALEYA RESTREPO, CAT for short, a contained, very
          centered 10 year old, pretty, but with a toughness, sitting
          at the dining room table, in a well kept, but modest home,
          with windows that look out over the steep hillside favela,
          attends to her notebook.
                         
          On the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid
          plants. The rare Cataleya orchid. All around there are
          packed cartons, suitcases. Moving day is at hand.

          He hands Don Luis a computer disc.

          He shrugs. Opens his arms. The two men embrace. Close
          as brothers.
                         
<b>                          FABIO

          And with that, Fabio exits the garden. Don Luis watches
          him, sad to see his friend go. Sighs deeply, pours himself
          a whiskey, downs it, turns to Marco.

          Two men, holding automatics in their laps sit in the back,
          the driver in the front. They see Fabio very contained,
          calm, walking towards them. The driver turns the engine
          on. Fabio slips into the passenger seat. The car takes
          off.
                         
          Fabio explodes. Smashes the dashboard. Over and over.

           and threatened to kill my whole

          Fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. Fabio exits to
          three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. The gunmen from the
          car take defensive positions. Fabio runs up the stairs.

          a storm coming. Fabio bursts in. His wife sees his tension
          filled face.

          Cat is strangely calm, just sits at the table. Watches as
          Fabio takes the family picture off the wall, pries the
          frame back, extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame,
          comes over to Cat.

          In a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into Marco's
          unsuspecting, open palm. Driven with such force, the knife
          pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the
          table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream
          but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.

          bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her
          onto the ledge of a very small window. As she looks back,

          that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela.
          She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father
          gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps
          over the small divide between her house and the next roof,

          kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between
          the rows of tomato vines.
                         
          When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over

          move. In the silence, you can hear a pin drop, until...
                         
          The biggest girl in the dorm, a head taller than everyone,
          and twenty pounds heavier, with bully written all over her
          face, saunters down the aisle right towards Cat. Her name
          is...

          no good rising on her smirking face.

          about to walk towards it, when Sherri puts a beefy hand in
          her chest.

          Cat looks at Sherri. Looks at the other girls all hanging
          on every word, waiting to see what jumps off.
                         
          Cat considers, then reaches into her jumper and extracts
          the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her. Hands it
          over to Sherri.

          Sherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack. She
          unzips it, puts Cat's twenty in with a wad of other
          twenties.

          The other girls hoot and whistle. Sherri removes her hand
          from Cat's chest.

          Cat still says nothing. She walks up the aisle past all
          the other girls, who remain silent. It is only after Cat
          has laid down on her bed, that the laughing and twittering
          resumes.

          it close in her hand, just lays that way.

          is a door marked EXIT. But she is not looking at the exit
          she is looking for something else. And she finds it. A
          door marked: HEADMISTRESS.
                         
          Cat tries the door, it is locked. She takes her father's
          medal from around her neck, and uses it to pop the lock.
          Looking left and right to make sure the coast is clear,
          she enters.

          the desk, pops the drawer, extracts the envelope with her

          Cat pours the contents of the bottle out into the cloth.

          Cat, the women get up and exit, closing the door behind

          He holds out the gun in one hand, and the schoolbag in the
          other. Cat hesitates for a moment. Takes the schoolbag
          from Emilio. Then takes his hand, and they walk off
          together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers,
          and people pour out of the school and the surrounding

          A ramshackle warehouse, it's windows streaked opaque with
          years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy
          garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind
          chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal.
          And two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on Earth, laying
          on their sides, asleep.
                         
          The dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low
          growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. The gate to
          the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are
          up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes
          flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to
          life, fangs bared, ready to kill.
                         
          And then they stop cold when they see who it is coming

          comes gliding into through the sharks. Who just go about
          their business. The figure stops at the edge of the glass

          ajar. He is more awake now, sees the Nymphettes sleeping
          soundly. He rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. He
          feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror,
          opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: In red
          lipstick, the word THIEF, and a drawing of a Cataleya
          orchid. Panic starts to set in.

          on. The glass shatters. William falls into the water.
          Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself
          up. His blood runs down into the clear water. Cat turns

          Marco looks at Eduardo, who glares at him. Eduardo goes
          to line up his shot. The tension in the room is thicker
          by the moment. As Eduardo is about to hit the ball, Marco
          grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball.
          At the same moment, Marco's two thugs whip out their guns
          and blast away. The shotgun wielding man, raises his gun,
          and as he is killed by Marco, his blast takes out one of
          Marco's thugs.
                         
          In an instant it is over. Everyone is dead, except Marco,
          one of his thugs, and the dazed Eduardo. Marco notices
          his ear is bleeding, touches it, it pisses him off that

          Cat cuts Emilio's beaten and bloodied body loose, and gently
          takes HIM in her arms. And begins to cry.

          room. Back and forth back and forth, Don Luis rams at the

          Ross gets up and leaves the room. Danny is feeling really
          shitty. He takes his phone out of his pocket, looks at
          Cat's picture. And then it rings.
