          guy who's fought hard to make himself a success in business
          and life. Derek wears a business suit and the first thing he
          does is cross the lawn to the SOLD sign.

</b>          With a new homeowner's look of satisfaction, Derek grips the
          SOLD sign and pulls it out of the ground.

          even bother to undress.

          Sound and perception are playing games with his head. The
          room begins to spin and he can hear a sound, a rushing noise.
          Is it the shower in the bathroom? The bathroom door is shut
          but there's a crack of light around the edges. Is someone in

          blazing look of sexual desire in her eyes. And somewhere in

          listening to music on her I-pod while texting a friend on her
          phone and paging through a teen magazine all at the same

          second. Then there's a LOUD KNOCKING. Samantha becomes
          aware, looks around, then sees a shadowy figure through the
          frosted window next to the door.

<b>          
</b>          In slow mo, the glass shatters and explodes around Lisa,

          deafening.
<b>          
</b>          The table gives way and Lisa lands hard on the marble floor,
