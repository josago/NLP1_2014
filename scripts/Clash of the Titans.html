          horizon.
          The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the

          to the edge and drop it into the rough sea. We HEAR a
          SCREAM from within.
          Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
          their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
          registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to

          Perseus opens the door to the Wilting Girl. Her beauty      
          electrifies him. She glows from within, but her color is    
          oddly faded, washed-out.

          to get me to leave this village,
          but tonight is impossible. My

          The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley,        
          headed toward the outskirts of town.
          Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones,     
          blocking her way. She startles, but does not stop. She
          goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right
          through the stone, like a ghost.
          On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing    
          hard. She looks around and hurries down an intersecting
          passageway.
          She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her,        
          thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
          takes a breath and dives into the surging growth.
          She almost makes it through, but at the last moment,        
          vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner. She
          gives up, with a sigh. We HEAR the LAUGHTER of a God.

           Here slumbers an enormous hybrid creature with human        
           features and a leathery, scaled hide -- HUMBABA.            
          Suddenly, Set the Void appears. The evil God strokes the    
          sleeping monster's head, then reaches inside Humbaba's      
          skull. The animal goes stiff; its leg twitches.

          Nearby, the Expedition (minus Abas) rests. Not here:
          Perseus, Draco, Icos, and Boreas.

          A herd of winged horses, PEGASSI, graze.
          Draco, Boreas, Icos and Perseus  -- thrilled -- hide in a

          With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him     
          back down.

          avoiding trouble.
          Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking     
          soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings,              
          buffeting Perseus with gusts.
          The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It       
          lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus     
          face-first into the dirt.
          Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a
          dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the
          clearing.

          Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL.       
          The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and       
          swallows it whole. Humbaba turns and SNIFFS the air,         
          homing in on Perseus.

          Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with     
          swords drawn to draw the monster's attention. Perseus        
          does the same.

          Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling-

          wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and
          is about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the
          harpoon.
          Leviathan opens its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked           
          toward the maw.
          Perseus swims upward toward Leviathan's tail. Perseus        
          concentrates -- a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY shoots      
          through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip.
          LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the
          harpoon in the Kraken's tail --
          -- at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious
          Andromeda.
          Contact -- an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge       
          races up Leviathan's spine. Jolted, the monster spits        
          Andromeda out.                                               
          The Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus.       
          Perseus shuts his eyes and yanks Medusa's head from the
          sack. Medusa's hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling
          energy into Leviathan's enormous eyeballs -- hardening
          them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres.
