                Belfort with Investor's Center in

                an extremely exciting investment
                opportunity crossed my desk today.
                Typically our firm recommends no

                this is one of them...

                buy before the takeover happens,
                before the lawsuit is settled,
                before the patent is granted.

</b>                 In Stratton parlance, there were
                 three kinds of hookers. There
                 were blue chips, the top of the
                 line. Model material. They were
                 priced between $300 and $500 and
                 made you wear a condom unless you
                 gave them a hefty tip, which I
                 always did.

                 `course, and in 1982 the U.S.

Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi.

Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray
to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa's eyes follow hers
and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes.

Naomi looks like she'd like to.     Hildy approaches,
introduces herself, then:

<b>                         HILDY

Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking
off to Naomi. Hildy comes running over.

                doing?!

     During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing
     Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --

                her.

     him and, like that, he's hooked.

     With Nicholas seated in a chair, Jordan sits across from
     him. Pacing behind him is Donnie, coked-up, face
     contorted, frothing with rage. Nearby, giant Chester
     Ming sits quietly, saying nothing.

     Jordan nods to Chester. Without a word, he crosses to
     Nicholas and BAMMM!! Nicholas's nose splits open like a
     ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere. Tough-guy Donnie
     takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail.

                 both named Rocco, and they
                 installed security cameras all
                 around the house. And one of
                 those cameras is right over
                 Daddy's shoulder.

</b>           That's one thing I like about what
           I do, the opportunity to make that
           right. Take this kid we had
           interning last year. Didn't want
           to be a broker, wanted to be an
           environmental scientist or
           something, he had a student loan
           debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway,
           his mom gets sick, all they can
           afford is third-rate care. Some of
           us got together, made an
           investment on his behalf and --
           boom -- overnight everything
           changes, she's seeing the best
           doctors in the country. Sadly,
           didn't work out, she passed but
           still: having the power to do that
           makes all the other bullshit worth
           while.
                (as Denham considers
                  that)
           See, it's all about proper
           guidance, Pat. Knowing someone
           with the right relationships,
           who's discreet. I can change a

<b>151   INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL'S OFFICE - DAY               151
</b>
      Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and
      one other SWISS BANKER. It's an impressive office, with          *
      an enormous fish tank.

<b>                               DONNIE
</b>                 We have a joke in America.
                 "Heaven is a place where the
                 police are Brits, the chefs are
                 Italian, the car mechanics are
                 German, the prostitutes are French
                 and the bankers are Swiss." I
                 never got it `til now -- look at
                 those fucking fish! Come here,
                 little guy...

<b>                               SAUREL
</b>                 Yes, we have the same joke here.
                 Only sometimes the English are
                 chauffeurs and the chefs are
                 French. The Germans, alas, are
                 always mechanics; no one wants to
                 grant them more authority than
                 that.

      Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish,
      cuts straight to the point:


<b>                               JORDAN

<b>                               SAUREL
</b>                 Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom
                 requires ten minutes of idle chit-
                 chat before business can be
                 discussed.
                      (a smile)
                 Of course, let's get "down to it."
                 What would you like to know?

           rolling down the Rue de la Croix?

More chuckles.   Through Jordan's forced smile:

<b>                         JORDAN (V.O.)
</b>           What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
           is are you going to fuck me over.

<b>                         SAUREL (V.O.)
</b>           I understand perfectly, you
           American shitheel.

Saurel smiles.

<b>                         SAUREL
</b>           The only way the Banque Real de
           Geneve would cooperate with a
           foreign legal body is if the crime
           being pursued also happened to be
           a crime in Switzerland. But there
           are very few Swiss laws pertaining
           to your "rumored" improprieties.
           Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is
           most appropriate: from a financial
           standpoint you are now in heaven,
           and we welcome you. If the U.S.
           Justice Department or FBI or SEC
           or IRS sent us a subpoena, it
           would become papier-toillette. We
           would wipe our ass with it.

Everyone's impressed.      Except Jordan.

<b>                         JORDAN
</b>           Unless it was an investigation
           into stock fraud -- which is a
           crime in Switzerland. Then you'd
           have to cooperate.

<b>                         SAUREL
</b>                (now he's impressed)
           Yes, we would. Assuming the
           account is under your name.
           However, if it were in the name of
           a nominee of yours...

They take each other in.

Fuck it. Jordan releases Donnie. Donnie crawls into the            *
dining room and starts shoving ham into his mouth in an            *
effort to sober up. Just then, we HEAR a horrible                  *
GAGGING sound. Donnie holds his throat as he falls                 *
backward choking, taking out the entire glass kitchen
table with a tremendous CRASH! Naomi rushes back in.               *

<b>                         NAOMI
</b>           Omigod, he's choking!     Jordan, do
           something!!

Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE --
Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of
spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm
muscles swell to five times their size.

Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat
spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he
takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...

Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.

<b>                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
</b>           He's not breathing!

Jordan places his fingers over Donnie's artery.         Nothing.

<b>                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
</b>           Save him!

Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie's chest,
breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.

<b>                         JORDAN (V.O.)
</b>           This stupid sonovabitch! All
           Donnie ever did was fuck me up and
           now I had to save his life `cause
           I took a CPR class when the baby
           was learning to swim. Just for
           the record, I want it noted: not
           for a second did I even think
           about letting him choke to death,
           even though it would've saved me
           an awful lot of headaches.

Donnie still isn't breathing. Jordan flips him over,
tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks
Donnie's ribs. He flips him back over, but he's almost
completely blue.

                  children!

       One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as
       hard as he can into Donnie's lungs. Donnie's stomach
       distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham
       projects from his mouth and into Jordan's face. Donnie
       coughs, vomiting. And as he starts breathing again,
       Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.            *

                  Five years ago when I started

                  a heavy heart that I tell you that
                  day is here.

       He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a
