<b>      "UBERMAN - METRO CITY'S HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND!
</b>      
      PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER
      HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a
      confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of
<b>      METRO CITY.

<b>      "UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MIND'S GIANT ROBOT!"
</b>      
      PHOTO: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT
      ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings.
      
<b>      "MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST!"
</b>      
      PHOTO: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by
      the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a
<b>      METALLIC GAUNTLET.
</b>      
      The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the
      MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each
      photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored
      glove.
      
      We ZOOM IN to the last headline.
      
<b>      "MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!"
</b>      
      PHOTO: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his
      hips, obviously trying to accentuate the "U" insignia on his
      chest.

<b>      EXT. BUILDING - DAY
</b>      
      We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the
      exact same position.
      
      WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city
      below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.
      
      He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as
      people happily go about their day.
      
      Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's
      expression.
<b>                                                               2.

</b>                You look so peaceful from up here.
      
      His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND
      coming from his wrist.
      
      He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.
      It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter "U".
      
<b>                          UBERMAN (CONT'D)
</b>                Looks like Roxanne's in trouble
                again.
      
      Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape
      gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off
      into the distance like a speeding bullet.
      
<b>      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT
</b>      
      Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned
      building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and
      wonder - now home to a great evil.
      
<b>      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
</b>      
      The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge
      hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC
      EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have
      an obvious function FLASH and HUM.
      
      A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story
      MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS
      INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-
      SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.
      
      He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain
      could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE
      WITH A GIANT GREEN "M" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging
      at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES
<b>      PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.
</b>      
      Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO
<b>      PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.
</b>      
      A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other
      men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.
      The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,
      is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.
      
<b>                          EINSTEIN
</b>                I hate the outfits. I mean, I get
                it: we're all supposed to be
                "masterminds" - very clever.

</b>                          EINSTEIN(cont'd)
                I just feel stupid. I mean, what
                the hell did Einstein really do
                anyway?
      
<b>                          PLATO
</b>                Theory of relativity.
      
      Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.
      
<b>                          EINSTEIN
</b>                Well, you'd think he'd invent a
                wool sweater that didn't itch so
                much.
      
      Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they
      see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.
      
      Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right
      shoulder and turns around.
      
      He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with
      his metal gauntlet.
      
<b>                          MASTER MIND
</b>                The real Einstein once said, "God
                does not play dice with the world."
                He was right, because the world is
                MY dice. Is that understood?
      
<b>                          DA VINCI & PLATO

<b>                          EINSTEIN
</b>                    (gasping for air)
                Yes, sir.
      
      Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.
      
<b>                          MASTER MIND
</b>                Alright, then - clean slate. Do we
                have the girl?
      
<b>                          DA VINCI
</b>                Yes, sir. She fell into our trap
                just like you knew she would.
      
<b>                          MASTER MIND
</b>                Reporters are a curious lot, and
                easily manipulated.
      
      He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his
      posture and sucks in his gut.
<b>                                                                  4.

                waiting.
      
<b>      MOMENTS LATER
</b>      
      Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE
      RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are
      standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away
      from us.
      
      She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo
      the blindfold.
      
      Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking
      features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes
      that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.
      
<b>                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
</b>                Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
      
      The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master
      Mind.

</b>                You didn't need to turn around like
                that. I can recognize the stench of
                failure.
      
      Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.
      
<b>                          MASTER MIND

                escapes whatever lame trap you've
                come up with, and takes you and

      Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main

      Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero
      intently searches his hideout.

      A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its

      The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the
      sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the
      burning star's power.

      The massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the
      heart of Metro City.
      
<b>      INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY
</b>      
      The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle
      of a busy news day.
      
      Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are
<b>      SHOUTING.
</b>      
      The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.
<b>                                                              17.
</b>      
      
      
      Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.
      
      Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room
      to see every eye on her.
      
<b>                          ROXANNE
</b>                It's...um...It's good to be back.
                Thanks for everyone's cards and
                concerns. I really appreciated it -
                now I'm ready to climb back on the
                horse.
      
      No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting
      to make her uncomfortable.
      
      The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK
      BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.
      
      Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad
      expressions on everybody's face.
      
<b>                          FRANK
</b>                Someone die or something?
      
      He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in
      his mouth.
      
<b>                           FRANK
</b>                    (cursing himself)

<b>                             ROXANNE
</b>                It's okay.
      
      Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the
      arm.
      
<b>                          FRANK

      He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns
      toward his door.
      
<b>                          FRANK

      Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM

      A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it
      on the table in front of them and leaves.
      
      Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to
      face him.
      
<b>                          ROXANNE
</b>                It was a traumatic experience. Yes,
                everyone knows Uberman and me
                were...close. But what I really
                need - what would really make me
                better is getting back to work.
      
      There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank.
      
<b>                          FRANK

      Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an
      idiot.
      
<b>                FRANK
</b>      It's the suits. They think it's
      time to switch things up.
      
<b>                ROXANNE
</b>      Oh, because they can't use me to
      get the big story.
      
<b>                FRANK
</b>      C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the
      nature of what we do. They used
      you, you used Uberman. Everybody's
      happy.
      
<b>                ROXANNE
</b>          (defensive)
      I didn't use him.
      
<b>                FRANK
</b>      Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you
      two were in love or something. My
      bad.

</b>                Very in love.
      
      There's a hind of self-doubt in Roxanne's expression, as if
      she's failed to convince even herself of this.
      
<b>                          ROXANNE
</b>                Okay. So, where are they going to

                if you just upped and quit. You
                busted your ass for that desk.
      
      Roxanne can hardly get it out - she's busy swallowing her
      pride
      
<b>                          ROXANNE
</b>                I'll take it.

<b>      EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
</b>      
      Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands
      out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century
      Gothic architecture.
      
      LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding
      a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY.
      
<b>      INT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY   - NIGHT
</b>      
      A mixture of old and new. Dusty Victorian furniture and
      dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely
      futuristic machinery.
      
      The building has been converted into Master Mind's new SECRET
<b>      LAIR.
</b><b>                                                              21.
</b>      
      
      
      In the center of the main room is a three storey tall GLOWING
      BLUE ORB. At the base of it is a sign that reads "Reactor -
      Don't Touch."
      
      We PAN OVER to the READING ROOM where Master Mind is sitting
      on a couch watching TELEVISION.
      
<b>                          REPORTER ON TELEVISION (O.S.)

                philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune
                in at 11:00 as we look into what
                has become Metro City's biggest

                Hearts: The Uberman story."
      
      Einstein and Plato come into the room holding a BAG OF LOOT.
      
<b>                          EINSTEIN

      Einstein tosses it on a LARGE PILE of purloined valuables in
      the corner of the room.

</b>                No.
      
      Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato
      sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out
      of it.
      
<b>                          PLATO
</b>                    (cheerfully)
                Sir, the new reactor is installed.
      
      Plato nods to the giant orb.

      Einstein gives Master Mind a funny look then exchanges
      glances with Plato before leaving the two of them alone.
      
      Without turning away from the TV, Master Mind addresses
      Plato.
      
<b>                          MASTER MIND (CONT'D)

</b>                Yes, sir, I know, but please

                that you seem to have lost your
                lust for our profession. You've
                stopped going on jobs and spend
                most of your time watching Uberman
                specials.
      
      Master Mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in
      a classically contemplative pose. After an overdramatic
      beat...
      
<b>                          MASTER MIND

      like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner - MASTER MIND'S

                lived with this unquenchable
                thirst. I thought it was to make

      Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to

      We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He
      appears to be lying on the couch.
      
      He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is
      as it seems.
      
      He lays his head back down.

      Roxanne and John Cusack are eating on the outside patio of a
      fancy restaurant.

</b>                Don't get me wrong, I love being a

      They go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes John
      Cusack's disguise generator to short.
      
      His true form of Master Mind is briefly revealed to Roxanne
      as a BOLT OF ELECTRICITY encircles his body.

</b>                Tell you the truth? He was kind of
                a dick. I mean, being a hero is
                dandy and all, but it's volunteer
                work. Now you've always had the
                right take on all this. I mean,
                when you rob a bank or take over
                the diamond exchange you get
                something out of it. I mean, when
                you don't get caught, which, no
                offense, isn't very often. And that
                brings me to what I wanted to
                propose to you: Who could catch you
                if I'm by your side?
      
      Perplexed by his proposal, Master Mind just stares at Titan
      awe-struck.

      As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out

      Two floors up Da Vinci releases a rope. A COPPER CAGE, like
      the one that caged Uberman, drops down on top of Titan.
      
      Titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. He walks to the bars,
      tries to pull them apart but can't.

      As he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look
      on Master Mind's face until Titan suddenly explodes out from
      under the street in front of him.

      street.

      watch Titan shrink into the distance.

      Besides the Armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact
      that this is the same person as Uberman. In the picture, he's
      even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists

      covered in discarded snack goods; and a Kiss Pinball machine
      stands in the far corner next to a CLOSED DOOR.

      A distant MECHANIZED RUMBLE can be heard. The noise rises,
      signaling the approach of something powerful.
      
      Titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the

      Brad and Frank look at each other and run to take cover
      behind a nearby building.

      flying into a nearby building.

      mounted GATLING-GUN is turning toward him.

      bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.

      Titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his
      hand.
      
      It flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade
      clean off. The rest of the Apache crashes to the street like

      Master Mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a FIRE HYDRANT.
      Titan's EYE LASERS burn through the hydrant releasing a high

      Master Mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of
