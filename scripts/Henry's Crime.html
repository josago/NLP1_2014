<b>          INT. TOLL BOOTH - DAWN
</b>
          A LONE TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT sits inside his glass box on
          an empty stretch of interstate.
          This is HENRY.
          He looks out at the horizon. It's starting to get light
          out. There's snow on the ground.
          He's neither asleep nor awake.

</b>
          HENRY'S PLASTIC GLOVES unscrew a THERMOS, pour coffee
          into a Styrofoam cup. There are only a few drops left.

<b>                         A CAR
</b>          Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window.
          But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE...
          Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He
          downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the
          horizon again.
          It's cloudy out there.

</b>
          Henry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps
          out into the icy morning.
          He walks toward his truck. The traffic is beginning to
          build.

</b>
          Henry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous,
          abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL.

                         

<b>          EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING
</b>
          The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest
          salt-box houses.

          Henry's truck rolls into his driveway.

<b>          INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Henry enters. Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks.
          It's clean and ordinary in here.
          His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a
          NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set
          for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a
          little surprised. Debbie appears. Lays down the toast.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Smells good.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           Sit down.
          He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Wow. Thanks.
          He digs in.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           How was your night?

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Good. How was yours?
          She's still buttering the toast. Carefully.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           Good.
          She sets it down.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           This is great.
          She sits down next to him. Watches him eat.

<b>                          HENRY (CONT'D)
</b>           Your shift's at eight thirty?
          She nods.

<b>                          HENRY (CONT'D)
</b>           You not eating?

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           I already did.
          He takes another bite.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           You okay?

<b>           3.

          Pause.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           Are you coming with me to Cindy and
           Bill's on Saturday?

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Sure. What time?
          Pause.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           For the baby shower.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Right.
          She just stares at him...

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and
           Bill's.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           What?

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come
           here.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime.
          Pause.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us?
          Henry stops eating.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           You're talking about kids.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           Of course I am.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Okay.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           'Okay' you want kids?
          Pause.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           I love kids.
          He looks down, resumes eating. A beat.

<b>           4.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           Henry?
          He looks up again.

<b>                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>           Do you still love me?
          He's still as a stone.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Of course I do.
          She looks at him.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           Because I know you did once.
          A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now.
          She's crestfallen.

<b>                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
</b>           What happened, Henry?
          He just sits.

<b>          THE FRONT DOORBELL RINGS
</b>          Henry gets up, heads to the door.
          Debbie watches him go...

                         

<b>          EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Outside on the step there are TWO MEN in SOFTBALL
          UNIFORMS. One of them is puking. Behind them TWO more
          GUYS sit in the back of the car.
          Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of EDDIE
          VIBES. Two parts charm, one part menace. His puking
          friend is JOE.

<b>                          EDDIE

<b>                          HENRY

          Eddie glances up and down the street.

<b>          INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Eddie and Henry watch while Debbie attends to the sick
          JOE, bits of puke still clinging to his softball uniform.
          She touches his forehead.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           He's hot.
          He starts to retch.

<b>                          JOE
</b>           (holding it in)
           I'm sorry.

<b>                          DEBBIE
</b>           You better come with me.
          Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly
          toward the bathroom.

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           Goddamn sausage at Pinwheels.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Yeah.

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           So we're in a little bind, Henry. Got
           league playoffs in a half-hour and Joe's
           our first baseman. And he's not exactly
           game-ready as you can see...

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           Yeah.
          Eddie stares at him. Smiles.

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           So, what do you say?

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           What do I say what?

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           You feel like playing a little ball?
           Filling in for Joe?

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           It's November.

           shape.

<b>                          HENRY

          Beat.

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           So what do you say?
          Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches
          Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open.
          She's tending to him, caring for him...
          Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.

<b>                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>           Henry?

                         

<b>          INT. IMPALA - LATER
</b>
          Henry drives. He wears Joe's too small softball uniform.
          Eddie rides shotgun, the other two in the back. They
          grimly stare out the windows.

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           Appreciate you driving, man.

<b>                          HENRY
</b>           So where's this game?

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           Near Kaisertown. Like fifteen minutes.

<b>                          CUT TO :

</b>
          The car turns a corner on to Main Street.

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           Pull up right over here. We gotta grab
           some beer money at that ATM.
          The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST

<b>          BUFFALO BANK.
</b>          Eddie pats Henry's shoulder.

<b>                          EDDIE (CONT'D)
</b>           Just hang tight. We'll be right back.
          Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.

<b>           7.
</b>
                         

                         
          After a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs
          his sleeve.

<b>                         BEHIND HIM
</b>          In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two
          guys slipping on SKI MASKS...

<b>                         HENRY'S POV
</b>          A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his
          store and enters. He says good morning to all the
          animals. It's a strange one man show.

<b>          LOUD ALARMS BLARE --
</b>          Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming

<b>                         FROM :
</b>
<b>          THREE GUYS IN SKI MASKS
</b>          Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various
          directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK
          GUARD chases them.
          ON HENRY, confused.
          A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is
          crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He
          sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun :

<b>           FRANK (O.S.)
</b>           You!
          Henry turns forward again.

<b>                         A GUN
</b>          Is pointing at him through the windshield.

<b>                          FRANK (CONT'D)
</b>           Freeze!
          Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel.
          Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the
          distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder.
          Holding on Henry's stunned expression...

                         

<b>          INT. POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          Henry sits at a small table as a DETECTIVE, whose face we
          never see, paces back and forth.

<b>                          DETECTIVE

          A JUDGE stares at Henry.

<b>          WHACK!
</b>          The gavel goes down.
          Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with
          the sentence. He pats Henry, well done.
          Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him...

          A cloudy spring day. Henry climbs out of the ditch.
          Throws down his shovel and shakes the wheelbarrowman's
          hand.
          He walks away past ROWS OF GRAVES. He notices a flower
          poking through the dirt.

          contemplates the place...
          Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in.
          There's something happening, he's not sure what it
          is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each
          passing moment becomes more like a knowing....
          A moment of revelation.
          He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now,
          heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the
          SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile --

          A beat. Henry looks at Max now. He looks frail.

</b>           Max. You can't die in this place.

          Madame Ranevsky.
          A black and white American flag wrapped around the trunk
          of the cherry tree with bloody roots.

          Henry enters the lobby. The light is low. There's
          something almost magical about this place.
          Henry hears VOICES drifting in from the main theatre as
          he continues to walk, heading toward the sounds..

          Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her
          shoulder. Looks at it. Then back at her. Comparing her
          photo to the live person.

          The head Parole officer leafs through page after page of

          tiny transistor radio. Max humming to the music, reading
          `Future Shock' on the toilet.
          The sound of the front door of the apartment opening --

          HENRY is standing right there, holding a bag of

</b>           I never liked that word. It's only half

<b>          EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE - DAY
</b>
          We follow A MAILMAN past a row of palm trees as he enters
          a traditional-looking BARBER SHOP : "MAX'S - A PLACE FOR

<b>                         GROOMING"
</b>
                         

<b>          INT. MAX'S BARBER SHOP - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          The Mailman hands a few letters to the pretty front desk
          GIRL. Max, his back to us, finishes a shave, talking his
          customer's ear off.

<b>                          MAX
</b>           Time is a medium of exchange. You can buy
           things with it. Education. Self-respect.
           You can even figure out your dream.
          The Guy nods. Max turns. We see him now. He's super tan.
          He pulls the sheet off his client.

<b>                          MAX (CONT'D)
</b>           You're done. Next!
          Another YOUNG CUSTOMER sits down. There's a few of them
          waiting their turn, enjoying Max's schtick.
          The front desk girl hands Max the mail.
          CLOSE ON A POSTCARD : `Our dream is our truth is our
          destiny...Love H... xx'
          Max smiles. Flips over the postcard and only now when he
          pins it above the mirror do we finally see what it is --
          an image of THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN.

<b>                          MAX (CONT'D)
</b>           So tell me, Javier. What's your dream?

<b>          THE SOUND OF BREATHING
</b>          Fade up on : what looks like the AFRICAN BUSH.
          It's hot. There are insects buzzing around and it doesn't
          look like rain's landed anywhere near here in years.
          A HAND reaches out for another HAND, helping someone over
          the final step.

          He puts his arm around her.

          EDDIE VIBES is being questioned by the unseen DETECTIVE.

<b>           DETECTIVE (O.S.)
</b>           I'm only going to ask you one more time,
           Eddie. Who was it? Who helped you?

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           I told you before. Dopey. Sleepy. Happy
           and Doc --
          WHAACK! The slap knocks Eddie to the ground. He's under
          the table now, his face crushed by the Detective's BOOT :

<b>           DETECTIVE (O.S.)
</b>           You know what you are Vibes? A liar, a
           cheat, a thief and a loser.
          He presses his boot down harder ON EDDIE'S FACE :

<b>                          EDDIE
</b>           I may be all those things but one thing
           I'm not...is a rat.
          Eddie smiles. His face squashed sideways like that, it's
          a pretty strange kind of smile...
