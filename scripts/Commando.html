          TIGHT ON the churning compactor of a garbage truck.
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the truck, battered
          and olive-grey. A bored garbage man with a kerchief
          over his mouth hangs on the back of the truck as it
          moves along the street.

          Lawson flings the green plastic bags into two battered
          and half-full metal cans, starts running down the

          driver, leans out, similarly armed.

          closing the trunk of a big new Cadillac. He's showing
          it to Diaz, who nods and makes noncommital NOISES as
          Forrestal continues the hype.

          Forrestal has said this last because Diaz has thrown
          the car into reverse, knocking down a big display.

          The car SLAMS into Forrestal, flinging his body across
          the hood. The car continues on, CRASHES through the
          outside window and disappears down the street.

          something else: Joy. Joy, and a sense of calm.
          Matrix reaches a shed behind the cabin. He puts down
          the log and chain saw, then picks up firewood and begins
          to SPLIT it with awesome single swipes of an axe.

          weapons on the seat...then releases the brake. Then,
          one hand on the wheel, the other on the door frame, he
          begins to push the car.
          He steers it not towards the dirt road, but towards the
          shoulder where a steep incline leads downward. Since
          the Blazer is pointed the wrong way, Matrix is pushing
          it uphill-the effort is incredible... the veins on his
          neck stand out...with a SCREAM, he puts everything he's

          Matrix gets out of the car, closes the door and starts
          to move across the parking lot. He stops as he notices
          Cindy getting out of the car, too.

          She closes the door and joins him. He looks at her for
          a beat, then they move toward the motel.

          They quietly and cautiously approach one of the motel
          rooms. The drapes are closed.
          Cindy stays a few feet back as Matrix, gun drawn,
          slowly EASES Sully's motel key into the door lock, then
          QUICKLY OPENS the door.

          Matrix, gun out in front, BURSTS into the room.
          No one's there.
          Cindy nervously peeks her head into the room, sees it's
          okay, joins Matrix inside, closes the door and locks
          the chain. They look around the room.
          Sully's suitcase is spilled open on one of the beds.
          Beer cans and fast food containers lay open and
          the bureau drawers are ajar.
          Matrix goes to the suitcase and searches through it.
          Cindy checks out the bureau drawers.
          Matrix finds nothing in the suitcase. He looks under
          the bed, then moves to the closet and looks inside.
          It's empty.
          There is a SUDDEN LOUD KNOCKING at the front door.

          Matrix moves into the bathroom and turns on the shower.
          Cindy tears the covers off the bed, musses up her
          hair and unbuttons her blouse to show some cleavage.
          Matrix and Cindy edge up to the door and Matrix flattens

          to attack. Cooke looks into the room at the rumpled
          bed, suitcase and fast food containers.
          The shower SOUNDS continue to echo from the bathroom.
          Cooke cautiously enters the doorway. WHAM!
          Matrix SLAMS the gun against the brawny Cooke's head.
          Cooke crashes back against the wall, but doesn't go
          down. He grabs Matrix's gun hand by the wrist and
          the two of them STRUGGLE for the gun.
          BLAM! BLAM! The gun FIRES into the ceiling as they
          wrestle around the room. They BREAK a table and CRASH

          Cooke slowly FORCES the gun toward Matrix's face. The
          barrel gets CLOSER... CLOSER... then almost points right
          at Matrix.
          With a sudden SURGE of power, Matrix lifts Cooke off

          that knife into me.
          The stern of the boat continues to burn as Bennett
          considers what Matrix said.

          Bennett's eyes fill with hate. More shells EXPLODE
          nearby.

          Matrix tosses the gun away down the beach. Bennett
          violently pushes Jenny into the wet sand along the
          edge of the water.

          He feints the knife toward Matrix.

          Bennett jabs again. This time Matrix parries the
          jab, and SLASHES Bennett, causing a bloody cut on him.
          They circle each other again, FEINTING jabs at each
          other.
          BOOM! BOOM! Two more shells EXPLODE and kick up sand
          nearby.

          A lieutenant pilots a copter as General Kirby, sitting
          next to him, speaks into a radio mike. They are flying
          along the coast of the island, another Army helicopter
          behind them. They HEAR the SOUNDS of the explosions.

          Bennets STABS at Matrix and Matrix grabs his wrist.
          With his free hand, Matrix STABS at Bennett and Bennett
          grabs Matrix's wrist.
          They are locked hand in hand, staring death into each
          other's eyes.

</b>          Jenny, watching the fight, notices Matrix's gun on the
          beach near her and hesitates to pick it up.

<b>          MATRIX AND BENNETT 400
</b>          Suddenly Matrix falls backward to the ground, pulling
          Bennett with him and FLIPS Bennett over him HARD to
          the sand.
          Matrix jumps up quickly to finish Bennett. Bennett
          quickly THROWS SAND in matrix's eyes.
          Matrix, blinded, stumbles badly.
          Bennett immediately grabs Matrix's knife hand around
          the wrist, then SINKS his own knife into Matrix's
          side.

<b>                         MATRIX
</b>
<b>          AAAHHH!
</b>          Matrix's eyes go glassy, then he drops his knife.
          Bennett lets Matrix's wrist go, looks at Matrix's
          glassy eyes for a beat, then he pulls his knife out of
          Matrix's side.
          Matrix STAGGERS for a beat, then STUMBLES a few steps
          and drops to one knee against the front outside hull of
          the boat.
          Bennett slowly approaches Matrix from behind, casually
          feeling the blade of his knife.
          He looks at Matrix's wide, unprotected back and Bennett
          smiles.
          Bennett pulls the knife back with his arm, preparing to
          plunge it into Matrix's back.

          He PLUNGES the knife down toward Matrix's back.
          Matrix moves LIKE LIGHTNING to the side. The knife
          misses him and GETS STUCK in the hull of the boat.
          Matrix turns toward Bennett.

          No...
          Bennett tries desperately to get his knife unstuck from
          the boat hull, but he can't. Fear FLOODS his eyes.
          Matrix moves close to Bennett.

<b>                         MATRIX

          He DRIVES his knife into Bennett's throat so hard the
          knife goes through Bennett's neck and comes out the
          other side.
          Still holding the knife, Matrix then DRIVES the knife
          into the hull of the boat.
          The knife STICKS into the hull, holding Bennett's neck
          there like a thumbtack holds a note on a bulletin board.
          BOOM? Suddenly there is another, larger EXPLOSION in
          the fiery back of the boat and the whole boat EXPLODES
          into FLAMES, leaving Bennett lost in the fireball.

          Matrix lies down, his head in Jenny's lap, and tries
          to still his bleeding.
          The two copters land. Kirby gets out of one and two
          medical corpsmen with a stretcher get out of the other.
          The corpsmen bring the stretcher to Matrix and gently
          ease him onto it. They start to carry him as Jenny
          walks alongside.

          The chopper starts to liftoff.
          Cindy suddenly RUNS to the chopper and JUMPS in the door
