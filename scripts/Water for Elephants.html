<b>          EXT. MODERN CIRCUS GROUNDS - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT
</b>
          An upstate New York town. A CIRCUS is being dismantled...The
          Big Top falls and is gathered up by workmen...Trucks are
          being loaded with animals.

<b>          EXT. PARKING LOT - CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          AN ELDERLY MAN , JACOB JANKOWSKI - 93 year old - stands
          alone, with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot.
          His shirt is stained with sweat - as if it took great effort
          for him to get there. As he watches the Circus disappear,
          Jacob looks lost, bewildered and fragile.
          CHARLIE, 50's circus manager, and RUSS, a tattooed teen with
          rings through his eyebrows, approach him with a wheelchair.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          Excuse me sir, can we help you?

          through here. Please...
          He offers the wheelchair. Jacob relents and sits.

</b>          I got it Russ. Take the walker.

          Russ takes the walker and exits as Charlie wheels Jacob.

          Father tunes a Philco Radio while smoking a pipe...The Mother
          pours coffee wearing a cardigan sweater and pearls.
          Late for class, Jacob grabs a piece of bread and bacon and
          downs a coffee as his mother sweetly scolds him in POLISH...
          His father says something supportive in POLISH as well. Jacob

          smooths her skirt.
          VETERINARY SCIENCES FINAL EXAMS is written on the board of a
          Lecture Hall. The Proctor announces from his desk.

<b>                         THE PROCTOR

          The Lecture Hall door opens and DEAN WILKINS enters. The Dean
          walks to the Proctor and they confer privately. Then:

          Jacob sees a steel table upon which lay his parents
          belongings; wedding rings, pearl necklace, his father's pipe.

          Jacob nods. The Coroner exposes first Jacob's father, then
          Jacob's mother. We see only Jacob's expression:

          house and all their assets,
          including your father's practise,
          are now property of the bank in
          default of the mortgage.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          But I'm telling you, my father put
          away every penny he ever earned.
          They owned that house outright. Why
          would he have a mortgage?

<b>                         HYDE
</b>          My guess is because he let people
          pay him in beans & eggs or whatever
          they had, instead of money.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          And so he's penalized for not
          turning away people who couldn't
          afford his help? He was a doctor.

<b>                         HYDE
</b>          Yes, I know, he was a very good man
          but in banking terms, in the
          reality of what makes this world
          actually function, he was an
          irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but
          you oughta to know the truth. This

          The Bank Representative continues MOS as Jacob opens the
          package,

<b>          JACOB (V.O.)
</b>          I didn't believe the lawyer or the

          savings. We were never broke. So
          why would they need a mortgage?
          And then it hit me...
          Jacob opens the package revealing a BRAND NEW SIGN, reading;

</b>          They did it to pay for my Ivy
          League education.
          For a moment Jacob can't move. This thought stuns him. With
          his house being picked apart and the Bank Representative
          speaking about papers, Jacob can't take it any longer. He
          drops the sign and walks away. The Bank Rep calls after him:

<b>                         BANK REPRESENTATIVE
</b>          Jacob? Jacob they need these signed
          by the end of the business day.
          Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep, pulling off his tie and
          tossing it. He is crying - the reality finally hitting him.

<b>          JACOB (V.O.)
</b>          I walked and I kept on walking...
          It's a strange feeling becoming an
          orphan the same time you're
          becoming a man...To have this
          freedom to be anything you want at
          the same time everything you were
          is taken away. So I just walked
          ...Then all of a sudden, I stopped.

<b>          EXT. A CLEARING NEAR A STREAM - OUTSKIRTS OF ITHACA - NIGHT
</b>
          Jacob stands with his feet in a clear stream. He is no longer
          crying. There are dense woods, pitch black, all around him.

<b>          JACOB (V.O.)
</b>          Like I'd been sleepwalking and I
          woke up. I had no idea where I was.
          Jacob can hear the buzz of insects, the glow of fireflies and
          the cries of distant animals in the woods. It unnerves him.
          Far off beyond the dense woods Jacob sees A MOVING FLICKERING
          LIGHT - like a distant, silent star moving past the trees.
          The Light is moving around the woods until it curves towards
          Jacob's direction. He hears a distant CLANK-CLANK...
          Curious, Jacob puts his shoes on and walks back to a gravel
          path that leads to TRAIN TRACKS just as:

<b>          THE MASSIVE TRAIN ENGINE EXPLODES INTO VIEW PASSING HIM.
</b>          Jacob is so close, he is hit by a wall of wind that nearly
          knocks him down. It is dark and the train is moving fast.

</b>          What is it inside of us makes us
          decide to grab onto life again and
          again, no matter how many times it
          abandons us without a second
          thought?...What is it makes us
          hungry for more of the same?
          Somebody smart should figure that
          one out.
          Jacob makes his decision: He runs parallel to the
          train...stumbling over gravel, pitching forward and losing
          his balance, recovering, then running faster, scanning for
          something to grab hold of to hoist himself up. He sees:
          AN OPEN STOCK CAR IS THREE CARS BEHIND HIM...As it catches up
          to him, he lunges forward, reaching for the iron grab hold
          and flings himself upward. He clings on with his left leg,
          elbow and chin. His right hand clings to the grab hold. With
          his left hand, he claws the floorboards of the stock car, but
          the aged wood scraps off under his fingers. His right leg is
          dangling, beneath the train itself, dangerously close to the
          tracks. Jacob is slipping...slipping...
          With everything he's got, Jacob makes one final "life or
          death"� effort, managing to get his left knee up over the
          edge. Using foot, knee, chin, elbow and fingernails, he
          scrapes his way inside the stock car and lies panting...

<b>          INT. STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - NIGHT
</b>
          A dim light barely illuminates the interior. Jacob breaths a
          brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly: A HUGE

<b>          HAND CONNECTED TO A EVEN LARGER ARM COMES OUT OF THE

<b>          DARKNESS, GRABBING JACOB BY HIS COLLAR, HOISTING HIM UP.

          easily, as the Brute moves him to the open car door.

          Jacob can now see THREE MEN playing cards by a kerosene lamp.
          ONE MAN HAS A RIFLE, aimed at Jacob. Another, A SHRUNKEN,
          STUBBLE FACED OLD TIMER, drinks out of a jug...
          Blackie holds Jacob out on the edge of the open stock car, as
          trees slam against the train almost cutting Jacob's face.

          Jacob is rolled awake as the train stops. He is disoriented
          as Blackie, Grady and Bill jump out through the open stock
          car door. Camel is fast asleep, drunk from the jug.

          Hundreds of dirty, unshaven men pouring out of the train
          like ants on candy. The wagons of the train are painted
          scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels. Emblazoned on
          each wagon; BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH.
          Jacob wanders as the Circus is being created: Canvas tents
          are raised, the Big Top laying sprawled on the ground. Men
          standing over seams, lacing pieces together...Eight man
          sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck
          speed....Teams of men are raising enormous poles with their
          combined weight, chanting: Pull it! Shake it! Break it!
          Again!...Now down stake it!...Several teams horses pulling
          wagons are charging right for Jacob..
          Jacob jumps out of the way, nearly being run down. He is out
          of place...in the way of this finely tuned machine.
          Jacob ducks into a LARGE TENT for safety.

<b>          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Jacob enters. A stillness takes the place of the chaos
          outside: The translucent tent is as tall as the sky. It has
          barely been set up - just the tent and:

<b>          THE ANIMALS.
</b>          Jacob is in awe. Camels, llamas, zebras and horses stand
          behind low ropes slung between iron stakes, some with their
          heads in mounds of hay.....Two giraffes stand within a chain-
          link fence....lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, bears, chimps
          and an Orangutan.
          The animals stop moving, as if to give Jacob an
          acknowledgement. Jacob responds with a nod or a smile.
          The Orangutan is stretching it's arm outside it's den for
          something out of reach. Jacob tries to understand.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          What is it? What do you want?
          The Orangutan strains its arm. Blinking at him. Pointing.
          Jacob looks around and sees A HALF SQUASHED ORANGE on the
          ground in front of the cage. He picks it up.
          Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange. She
          takes it and sets it on the floor of her den. She returns and
          reaches out for Jacob again.

          trust her, Jacob extends his hand to hers.
          The Orangutan wraps her long fingers around Jacob's hand and
          holds it for a beat, looking to his face. Jacob returns the
          gaze, realizing she is thanking him. He is touched.

          Jacob shovels ZEBRA manure, no longer affected by the scent.
          By this point, the menagerie tent has been fully installed:
          Ten chandeliers hang and twinkle from the roof illuminating
          the a gloriously bannered candy stand in the tent's center.
          Jacob hears someone entering the menagerie. He turns to see;

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          17.
</b>          Behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses, Jacob
          catches flashes of pink sequins...pink tights...pink sequined
          gloves of a WOMAN caressing and whispering to them.
          She is MARLENA. Her shimmering eyes and hair. Her porcelain
          skin. Her pink sequins make her glisten and sparkle...
          Jacob is spellbound as he watches Marlena's gift with horses;
          Marlena uses signals with her whip or clicking sounds with
          her tongue to communicate with the horses: they line up at
          her subtle command, they raise their hooves, they bow down to
          her, rise up on their hind legs...
          She clicks her tongue and one White Silver Maned Horse lifts
          a hoof for her to inspect. She clicks for him to take a step.
          Jacob notices the Silver Maned Horse walks tenderly on the
          foot. He decides to help....Approaching the shimmering
          Marlena, Jacob looks like he's been shovelling shit all day.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Excuse me, ma'am? Hi. I'm Jacob.
          Marlena doesn't respond. She looks at him with suspicion.

<b>                         JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>          May I? He may be foundering.
          Marlena nods. Jacob also clicks his tongue as he glides his
          hands up Silver Star's fetlock. To Marlena's surprise, the
          horse trusts Jacob, lifting its hoof. Jacob examines it.

<b>                         JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>          He should be all right for tonight.
          But I'd put him on stall rest as
          soon as possible.
          He clicks his tongue and eases the hoof down. Marlena looks
          both impressed and insulted. Jacob smiles. Marlena does not.
          She clicks and assembles her horses in formation, then leads
          them out of the menagerie....Jacob looks after her adoringly.

          Jacob, none too pleased, advances to the edge of the platform
          as the train speeds by, and looks where August is pointing;
          He can see the edge of a thin iron ladder. He wipes his hands
          on his thighs. Focuses. Then leaps...
          Jacob's right hand meets the ladder. His left grasps wildly
          until it ensnares the other side. His feet jam into the

          The two men dance and leap atop the train from car to car

          Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain.
          Marlena takes over, by sitting besides Silver Star's head,
          and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby.
          Jacob registers Marlena's soothing effect causes Silver Star
          to relax...his breathing grows calmer. So Jacob begins to
          examine him as Marlena watches protectively.
          Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock. He
          lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefinger
          on the back of the fetlock. He looks at the sole of the hoof,
          which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge.
          Jacob's expression tells us this is a bad sign.

          Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation. Jacob
          doesn't want to tell her the truth.
          Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the
          horse. Jacob pulls August away to whisper.

          Beat. August's stares at Jacob - or rather, stares through
          him. A dead stare that lasts just a beat or two too
          long...And then just as suddenly, the look is gone:

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          I know you are. Come with me.
          August exits. Jacob doesn't know what this means. He follows.

          TWO BUCKETS FILLED WITH PUTRID MEAT. Flies buzzing on top.
          Diamond Joe finishes filling the buckets as August grabs one.

</b>          Joe, bad report for Silver Star I'm

          Diamond Joe registers a concerned, anxious look to Jacob.

          Diamond Joe seems uneasy about this as we follow August and
          Jacob, who comments on the putrid meat.

<b>                         JACOB

          Jacob waits with the buckets outside the car. August is
          inside unlocking the padlocks, then reappears and jumps out.

<b>                         AUGUST

          Apprehensive, Jacob hops up. August hands him the buckets.

<b>          INT. CAT CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT
</b>
          The cat dens have two compartments: to the left is a pair of
          lions. To the right, a tiger and a panther. All are massive.
          As soon as Jacob appears, they lift their heads ominously.
          August has unlocked the dens but left the padlock hanging on
          the cage bars. The animals can smell the buckets now. They
          growl. Jacob is a bit unhinged:

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          What do I do, just open the door
          and toss it in?

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          Unless you think a formal sit-down
          is appropriate.
          Jacob approaches the tiger first. The six hundred pound cat
          rises then roars, his massive head hitting the cage and
          rattling the lose padlock. Jacob freezes.

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

          that's him on the left.
          August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty mane
          and visible rib cage. Smaller than the tiger, Jacob has a bit
          more nerve. He reaches for a bucket...August suddenly shouts,
          unnerving Jacob even more:

          between them, but no matter. He lifts the bucket and
          approaches the lion's cage. Rex, the lion, lunges at the den
          door. Jacob freezes.

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
</b>          What's the matter? Didn't they
          cover this in school?
          August is having a grand time. Jacob smirks. Rex is rubbing
          his mangy coat against the cage bars.
          Jacob fumbles, removing the padlock and laying it at his
          feet. He lifts the bucket and waits. When Rex turns away from
          the cage door, Jacob swings it open. But before he can spill
          out the contents of the bucket:
          Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacob's arm. JACOB
          SCREAMS. The bucket drops, spilling the entrails inside which
          cause Rex to release Jacob's arm and attack the food.
          Jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an arm.
          He does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if he'd
          dipped it in boiling water. But no skin is broken.
          August is hysterically laughing. Furious, Jacob storms off;

<b>                         JACOB

          quickly, August's tone of voice turns darker:

</b>          Jacob..
          Jacob stops and turns. August isn't laughing any more. He has
          that sniper's stare of August's darker side...August moves
          towards Jacob, almost menacingly, as he speaks;

          August squeezes Jacob's sore arm from Rex's attack. Jacob
          cries out in pain as August holds his grip yet speaks calmly;

          continue to perform until he drops

          head, stroking his nose and humming the lullaby.
          Marlena strokes Silver Star as Jacob appears. And Marlena

</b>          The connective tissues between the
          hoof and the coffin bone are

          rotates toward the sole of the

          Then August does a surprising thing: He sits in the center of

          The train wheels screech as it begins to stop. Jacob rises
          and looks out of open train car doors..

          The train is pulling into the site of a "ghost town"�
          abandoned circus; a dilapidated Big Top, broken wagons and

          There's a guy with this outfit who
          has a parasitic twin growing out of
          his chest. He dresses it in a tiny
          tuxedo and black patent leather
          shoes. No talent but a real money-
          maker with the rubes. Calls himself

          August'll pay him double what he

<b>                         KINKO

          nowadays. Circus bosses see the end
          coming and they'd pull a runner
          with all the money. Menagerie
          belongs to the town now. August can
          get anything he wants for a song.
          Jacob and Kinko watch August striding through the grounds as
          desperate performers hopeful for work rush up to him.

</b>          Most of them will never belong to

          August is helped by Earl, who pushes the performers aside so
          August can head straight for the Goshen TOWN OFFICIALS,
          standing beside an Oldsmobile. They exchange greetings.

          Jacob is checking baggage stock horses when he sees:
          Marlena sitting alone outside her stateroom. He walks to her.
          Just as he reaches her, Marlena turns to him, looking as if

          August smiles at Marlena who looks back contemptuously, upset
          about Silver Star. August ignores her. Jacob notices the

          dismantling and taking what they need...As our characters
          walk through, this crowd of working men in constant motion
          part the way to reveal:
          ROSIE THE ELEPHANT: She is gargantuan. Ten feet tall at the
          shoulder. Her skin is mottled and cracked from the tip of her
          trunk down to her feet. Only her ears are smooth. She has
          deeply set, amber eyes with extremely long lashes. She stands
          tall behind a rope, chained to a stake in the ground.
          Jacob, Marlena, August, Diamond Joe and Greg observe her.

<b>                         JACOB

<b>                         DIAMOND JOE
</b>          She's a hundred if she's a day.

</b>          Darling, what do you think? She's
          magnificent, isn't she?
          Marlena keeps her rage silent, but it is all the more potent.
          August decides to ignore it. Jacob keeps his eyes on Rosie
          but feels the tension between them.
          ROSIE'S CARETAKER approaches: filthy shirt behind suspenders.

<b>          ROSIE'S CARETAKER

          bull man, I gotta tell the township
          or else they can't sell her to ya.
          August grabs Jacob's arm and shoves him forward;

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          Here he is. He's my bull man..
          Rosie's Caretaker looks at the surprised Jacob, then:

<b>          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
</b>          All right. See this animal...this
          here's the stupidest Goddamn animal
          on the face of God's good
          earth....Here's your bull hook.
          You're gonna need it.
          He tosses A BULL HOOK - a wooden rod about three feet long
          with a four inch metal pick coming off the end - to Jacob.

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          I don't believe it. The mayor said
          she was the best bull you had.

<b>          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
</b>          If she was the best bull, why is
          she the only one left? You think
          you're the first show to turn up
          picking on the bones?
          August is annoyed. As the Caretaker gathers his things:

<b>          ROSIE'S CARETAKER (CONT'D)
</b>          Some elephant tramp who dropped
          dead in Genesee sold her for a song
          which still ain't no bargain cause
          she ain't done a damn thing since
          but eat everything in sight.
          (Starts to walk away)
          Well, good luck to ya. And if I
          don't ever see another dumb bull in
          my life it'll be too soon.

<b>                         (SPITS)
</b>          Rosie pulls her trunk from the trough. She lifts, aims, and
          blasts the Caretaker with such a force, his hat sails off his
          head in a stream of water.
          Jacob, August, Diamond Joe and Greg bite their lips from
          laughing. Marlena just stares into Rosie's eyes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          46.
</b>          The Caretaker stops, his hair and clothes dripping. He
          doesn't turn, just stands still for a moment - then moves on.
          August's enthusiasm is slightly dampened.

<b>                         AUGUST

          They exit. Jacob and Marlena are left alone with Rosie as
          Flying Squadron men continue to work in the tent. There is an
          awkward pause between them...then:

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Mrs. Rosenbluth, I hope I'm not
          speaking out of turn here but - but

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          I know....Thank you.
          This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad.

</b>          And please, call me Marlena. I'm

          Jacob smiles. He faces Rosie and tries to cheer Marlena up.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Hello Rosie, I'm Jacob Jankowski.

<b>                         MARLENA

          They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena.
          A HARMONICA PLAYS A TUNE in the distance. They turn towards
          the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent.
          All the workmen have left.
          Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them.
          There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the
          three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's
          come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of
          them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing
          attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable.

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          What is it?

<b>                         KINKO
</b>          It's trouble, that's what. Not that
          I give a damn, but you're playing
          with dynamite with those two and
          you're gonna blow all of us up.
          August is the meanest sonofabitch
          I've ever met.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          I admit he has his moments of
          insanity but he's really a very
          generous, charming guy.

<b>                         KINKO
</b>          You don't get it, do you? When
          August feeds your arm to a lion -
          that's the real August. The one
          who's generous and charming -
          that's the insane August.
          They hear a fight outside the car. They move to investigate:

<b>          INT/EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON.

          Jacob and Kinko look out of the open ring stock car to see:
          August is standing before A MAN who is being held by
          Blackie's Men and punched by Blackie himself. The Man is
          bleeding and bruised. Various other performers and working
          men also watch the brutality;

</b>          Six men got red lit last night.
          Cancelling shows and that damn
          elephant cost August. He needed to
          clean house to save on payroll...
          It's a lousy day when an animal
          gets paid and men don't.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Why are they beating him?

<b>                         KINKO
</b>          He hid one of the men who was
          supposed to be tossed. Word was the
          train was over a trestle instead of
          land. Nobody comes back from that.

<b>                         THEY HEAR:

</b>          Get rid of him. He comes back on my
          property, you can shoot him.
          August walks away, with Earl and his men in tow. Blackie and
          his men drag the beaten Man away. As they turn, Jacob
          recognizes the Man;
          It is WADE who worked Jacob on his first day.

</b>          JACOB! Come in, come in!
          Jacob enters their Stateroom which takes up half the car,
          with an additional room, cordoned off by a velvet curtain.
          The main room is paneled in walnut and outfitted with damask
          furniture, a dinette and a Pullman kitchen.

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

          Jacob's eyes go wide upon seeing Marlena who appears looking
          radiant in a rose silk, off the shoulder evening dress.

          August winks at Marlena who giggles at their secret as August
          ushers Jacob to the velvet curtain...

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

          Rosie. My plan is to have the act
          ready for the Manhattan/Jersey show

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Unfortunately we had to let some
          men go last night...
          Jacob listens to how August will explain this:

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
</b>          ...I don't like doing it, not one
          bit. But to keep hard working men
          working, I had to get rid of lay-
          abouts and thieves who are dead
          weight. If I had the funds to pay
          them all I would, but times being
          as they are...I regret it though.
          Jacob believes him. August turns to him, with cheer:

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
</b>          So tomorrow, my faithful bull man,
          we begin! But tonight - we dine!!
          Tonight, we all deserve champagne!
          August whisks the velvet curtain aside:

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
</b>          Ta-dah!
          A tuxedo for Jacob, who smiles, impressed.

          asparagus in cream.
          - Marlena's dress barely covers her shoulders, exposing her

          barely keep his eyes off of her during dinner...

          more. Marlena laughs at Jacob's embarrassment when he
          realizes his plate is clean...
          - Wine is poured over and over...as the evening continues.
          - August is at the center of conversation entertaining
          Marlena and Jacob. They are drunk from the wine!

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
</b>          Jacob, I want to apologize to you,
          in front of my darling Marlena so
          she can witness how truly sorry I
          am for any bit of nastiness between
          us...Running this show, the many
          pressures...It can get the best of

</b>          People don't realize how much
          August does holding everything
          together. How difficult it is in
          these times. The whole company is
          like a family to him.

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          Thank you my love.
          He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob;

<b>          AUGUST (CONT'D)
</b>          From now on I shall trust your
          judgement in all things
          veterinarian. Please say you accept
          my apology.
          Jacob is enamoured with August again, especially seeing
          Marlena smiling in agreement.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Of course I do, August. You've been
          nothing but swell to me.

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          Good man!

<b>                         (SINCERE)
</b>          I could truly use a friend I can
          trust.
          Jacob once again beams at the compliment as August pours more
          wine. But Jacob feels a twinge of guilt. He stands to make a
          dramatic statement. August and Marlena look up to him.

          August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention.

</b>          I never took my final exams at
          Cornell. I'm not a real vet.
          Beat. Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the dire
          earnestness with which Jacob made his statement.

<b>                         JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>          But it's true. I never got my
          degree. I'm not a licensed vet.
          They laugh even harder.

<b>                         AUGUST

          you're a vet. You have the gift.

          not apply to us.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Not about this, August.

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          All right, let me ask you - do you
          honestly think this is the most
          spectacular show on earth?

          No.

</b>          No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our
          Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at
          the tops. And you really think the
          Tattooed Man got tattooed by
          headhunters in Borneo? He's from
          Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to
          ink himself. And you know what I
          did when the hippo died? Swapped
          out her water for formaldehyde and
          kept showing her. For two weeks, we
          travelled with a pickled hippo..

          ..The world is run on tricks - in
          here and out there. So trust me,
          it's having a talent that counts.
          In this world, it's all that's
          real. Look at this country, these
          dead, God awful towns we play.
          Talent and illusion bringing life
          to what is dead...Even for just a
          matinee. How wonderful is that?
          Jacob believes he's right. Marlena smiles in agreement.
          August rises to toast. Jacob and Marlena follow.

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          To all we love.
          He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in
          front of a guest. Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes.
          Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to
          dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis
          Armstrong's DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME.
          August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice,
          encouraging Jacob to join in...August is a great performer,
          filling up the space with his impersonation. Jacob can only
          laugh along.

<b>                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on Jacob! It's customary to
          sing for your supper!
          Jacob joins in to perform with August. Marlena applauds them.
          August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings. They
          begin to slow dance, very intimately.
          Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered
          chair, drinking more champagne. Jacob watches them dance:

<b>          JACOB (V.O.)
</b>          He looked like a different man when
          he looked at her. I said to myself,
          maybe love does that to a man. I
          didn't know much about it.
          Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively.

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          Darling. Darling, please..

<b>                         (GIGGLES)
</b>          Gently. We have a guest.
          August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his
          eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining
          her. Marlena smiles and strokes his face. August doesn't
          respond. He remains intense...

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
</b>          Darling, what is it?
          August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete
          control, as if searching for proof of something he can't
          trust. His grip tightens, hurting her.
          Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene...But Marlena
          shows no sign of fear. She knows exactly what to do.

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
</b>          August, dear...
          She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it.

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
</b>          You don't know your own strength,
          my love.
          And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens,
          relaxes, almost into sadness...as if he's about to
          cry....Marlena senses it immediately. She whispers lovingly.

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
</b>          Auggie?
          August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena
          and throws himself face first on the bed.

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
</b>          Excuse me, Jacob.
          Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs
          onto the bed, taking off his shoes. August begins snoring.

          curtains and returns to Jacob in the main room.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Is everything all right?
          Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she
          returns to her Victrola and selects another record. She
          cranks it on and plays it low. A RUTH ETTING SONG.

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          Oh yes. He's just had too much to
          drink, that's all. I hope you had a
          good time tonight. I wanted so much
          to make things up to you.

<b>                         JACOB

</b>          Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt
          horrible about what happened. He
          really does like you Jacob. But
          it's hard for him. He's under a lot
          of pressure. He does more than
          people realize holding things
          together.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          You said that.

<b>                         MARLENA

          (Opens her arms to him.)
          One dance before you go?
          Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when
          Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against
          her bare back, he almost swoons. They slow dance. Both tipsy.

          Thirty performers cram the area usually occupied by Marlena's
          horses, including BARBARA and another Coochie girl, NELL.
          Kinko and Queenie are performing tricks. Jacob watches. He
          admires the talent and humor of Kinko and Queenie's act. At
          the end, the girls laugh and applaud. Jacob joins in:

          refuse to let him leave. In fact, he is picked up bodily,

          to get a peek like he was rolling a
          coin over his finger tips...
          Rosie leads a small parade of clowns, including Walter and a
          perky, healthy Queenie down the main street. Marlena sits
          atop a Percheron, in full costume. Jacob walks astride.
          Lucinda's Wagon, carrying "the dead Lucinda"�, follows.

<b>          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          It wasn't really Lucinda in there.
          It was Barbara in a fat suit and
          wig inside the hippo den. We buried
          the real Lucinda by the railroad
          tracks between towns. Cemeteries
          cost too much. We were the only
          family she knew.
          People line up to cheer and offer their silent respects...and
          satisfy a ghoulish fascination at the "dead"� fat lady.

<b>          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          August sure was right about Rosie.
          She pulled the people right in.
          Rosie played that crowd like a pro.
          The rubes love the exotic Rosie...kids run up to pet her with
          their parents.
          As Rosie passes, we see AN OLD WOMAN standing in front of her
          green shuttered house waving with delight. We see she has a
          abundant vegetable garden which Rosie eyes covertly.

          all knew it was too soon for
          Rosie's debut.
          Rosie heads the line. Marlena sits atop her, in her sequins
          and headdress, grabbing onto Rosie's leather halter.

          still. His fingers clutch and release the bull hook.
          The SPEC MUSIC begins and everyone makes last minute
          adjustments...Kinko and Queenie included....August shouts
          into Rosie's ear.

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>
<b>          MOVE! MOVE!
</b>          Rosie hesitates so August strikes her right shoulder with the
          bull hook. The pain sends Rosie flying through the Big Top
          flap, causing Marlena to adeptly flatten her back atop Rosie
          so as not to hit her head on the pole that runs across the
          Big Top flap.
          Others gasp at the near accident. August is already furious.
          Jacob senses danger ahead. He follows in, curling the edge of
          the sidewall so as not to impede the Spec performers.

<b>          INT. BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</b>
          Jacob watches as Rosie makes it twenty feet down the
          hippodrome track then stops.
          Without missing a beat, Marlena yanks herself upright, beams
          a smile and thrusts her hands in the air, her back arched,
          her toes pointed - as if it were all a part of the act.
          The crowd goes wild - clapping, throwing peanuts, whistling.
          Rosie only moves in fits and starts, causing the rest of the
          Spec to pass them by at times. She trots ahead of August and
          then when August reaches her she stops, making August halt
          awkwardly. August feels humiliated until:
          The crowd laughs, thinking it's the act. They applaud.
          August realizes the crowd loves it. So August, the performer,
          starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience, acting
          comically angry and frustrated with Rosie..
          But when he turns back to Rosie, he is red-faced with real
          anger, poking under her shoulders with the bull hook.
          After three stops and starts, August plunges the bull hook
          sharply into her shoulder blade...and Rosie takes off at a
          faster speed, curling her trunk in the air. The crowd cheers!

</b>          Marlena grasps Rosie's halter as they fast approach the
          dangerous pole above the entrance. If Marlena doesn't bail,
          she'll be knocked off by the pole.
          Jacob, August, the Spec and the audience watch enthralled as
          Rosie charges toward the entrance...when suddenly:
          Marlena lets go of the halter and leans hard to the left.
          Just as Rosie bolts out of the Big Top, Marlena grabs hold of
          the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as
          Rosie exits the Big Top...
          For a moment, the audience doesn't know if this is part of
          the act. Jacob wants to run to help her...
          But Marlena quickly decides what to do; She lets go of the
          pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is
          facing the audience, still hanging from the pole.
          Her face lights up and she points to her toes. The Band
          Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a
          drum roll. The crowd relaxes and applauds.
          Marlena begins swinging, gaining momentum as the band roll
          mounts. Soon, in one final burst of performance inspiration,
          she releases herself from the pole, sails through the air
          tucking her body into a ball, rolling twice, uncurling for
          one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her
          feet. She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air.
          The crowd goes wild. The Band plays victory music. Coins are
          thrown from the bleachers. Even the Spec performers cheer.
          August acknowledges the audience's response by bowing as if
          it were all his creation.
          But after a moment, Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she
          turns and subtly limps out of the Big Top. He follows her.

<b>          EXT. BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN NJ - DAY

          Jacob rushes to her. Marlena, in pain, collapses in his arms.

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          Oh Jacob...
          August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of
          Marlena in Jacob's arms. He immediately tenses up.

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          A little shaky. Sore wrists.
          Bruised heel. Doc says she'll be
          fine. Did you catch the bull?

</b>          She's in the menagerie.

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          Good.
          August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold
          blooded intent towards the menagerie. Jacob panics, realizing
          what August about to do. Jacob follows to stop him;

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          August! Wait! She was good! She
          came back on her own! Besides, you
          can't do anything now! The show is
          still going on.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>
<b>          AUGUST, NO!
</b>          Jacob touches August's arm. August turns on Jacob with a
          murderous expression, shoving him to the ground. Jacob is
          about to get up to fight but August cautions him with the
          bull hook to stay down. August smiles slightly. Would he
          really use that bull hook on Jacob or is he kidding? Jacob
          stays down. August continues on, entering the menagerie tent.

<b>          MARLENA (O.S.)

          Jacob sees Marlena running towards him.

          Jacob and Marlena run across the grounds to the menagerie as
          workmen are running out of the menagerie tent, hearing August
          screaming from inside. They enter the menagerie tent to see:

          August is beating Rosie, who cries out with each blow. The
          animals are panicking from inside their cages - the lions
          roaring, the monkey's squealing. Marlena freezes at the
          entrance as Jacob runs to August.

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>
<b>          AUGUST...STOP!!!
</b>          August turns to see her. Enraged, he stops Jacob with:

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          Get her out of here! NOW!
          Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this
          moment. He returns to Marlena and ushers her out, as August
          continues to beat Rosie.

<b>          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT
</b>
          Marlena and Jacob step away, hearing Rosie cry out. Marlena
          can't bear it. She grabs Jacob's hand for support. Jacob
          tentatively holds onto her waist, guiding her away. She leans
          into him. Jacob loves being this close to her.
          The screams of August O.S. pull their attention to see:
          Earl and his men physically dragging a maniacal August out of
          the tent, his bull hook and clothes bloodied by his rage. He
          is kicking and struggling against them like a madman.
          Jacob is shocked by August's behavior. But Marlena has seen
          it before. She pulls away from Jacob and exits O.S. alone.

          Rosie is lying on her side, her foot still chained to the
          stake. She is quivering, riddled with bloodied holes.
          Jacob is kneeling, applying zinc ointment, not knowing where
          he can touch that won't hurt her. He is heart broken.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Rosie, what am I going to do with
          you?
          Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking. Her trunk
          lifts and wipes at her own eye.

          the right, if you ask me.
          Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry. He sees the
          bull hook. He grabs it and marches out of the menagerie.

          Isn't there anyone who understands?
          (Jacob remains silent)
          Ah, it's all my fault, I know it

          that bull. I can't pay the workmen.

          Jacob looks in the mirror and indeed - with Rosie's blood on
          his open shirt, bull hook in hand - he looks like a violent
          man.

          August smiles. But Jacob is unnerved by the smile...and the
          comparison. Suddenly, Earl enters and looks around, on alert;

          Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this
          wild or spontaneous. She sings along with the band...she
          keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table.
          However, she is acting distant to August.
          August is happy she is having a good time. When he slides
          next to her and puts his arm around her, Marlena stiffens;

          for our new stateroom and look what
          happened to him. Everything August
          touches gets fed to the cats one
          way or another.

          Jacob is moved. Marlena shifts gears and rises.

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
</b>          I want to dance.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Maybe you should wait for August.

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          I want to dance now!
          She pulls him up onto the dance floor. Marlena dances light
          as air. She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so
          that her back is to him. Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone
          - skin to skin. Her chest rises and falls under his arm. Her
          hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she
          unwinds away from, like a ribbon.
          When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance -
          including Marlena. Jacob beams. He looks up to the bar:
          August stands stock still. His eyes glaring at Jacob. The
          dark expression we've come to know. Seething with quiet rage.
          Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear;

<b>          OFF CAMERA SHOUT
</b>
<b>          RAID!! RAAAAID!!! EVERYBODY OUT!!!
</b>          PANDEMONIUM: Jacob is swept by a crush of bodies. People
          scream, shoving their way towards the exit. Marlena is shoved
          along with them, a few heads in front of Jacob.
          Jacob reaches through the sea of flesh and grabs a hand. By
          Marlena's expression, we know he has grasped her hand. Jacob
          scans the panicked crowd for August but all he sees are
          strangers running in every direction, people screaming..
          Jacob's hand is ripped apart from Marlena at the doorway.

          Jacob is thrown into the alley. People are piling into cars,
          engines are starting, wheels squealing.
          Suddenly, Marlena appears, grabbing Jacob's hand. She takes
          off her shoes. They run through back streets.

<b>          EXT. IRON FIRE ESCAPE - NEW YORK CITY ALLEY - NIGHT

          They run under a fire escape, panting, out of breath. The
          sirens and screams of the crowd are distant.

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          Lord, that was close...Aw, look at

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          I wonder if August got out...
          Marlena looks up at Jacob and starts laughing hysterically,
          as if for no reason. They are both still drunk.

<b>                         JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>          ...I don't know how we're going to

          Marlena's laughing subsides as she gets an idea.

<b>                         MARLENA

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          I don't know where he is, do you?
          And he doesn't know where we are.
          It's not our fault. Like you said,
          who knows how long it'll take us to
          get back.
          Jacob is hesitant. Marlena takes his hand and softly pleads;

</b>
          A summer storm with thunder and lightening is coming towards
          them from over the Hudson River.
          Marlena and Jacob are looking out at the expansive 1931 view
          of New York City. Other couples stroll about the sky deck.
          Marlena breathes in deeply...

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          I've never seen so far. Have you?
          (Jacob shakes head)
          Look at it. As far as the eye can
          see and it's nowhere near all
          that's out there.
          Jacob notices tears in her eyes.

<b>          THE THUNDER BREAKS AND THE RAIN BEGINS TO POUR...
</b>          Suddenly, MARLENA SCREAMS as loud as she can, startling the
          other couples. Jacob laughs. Beat of silence, then:

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry.
          But Jacob understands; He screams and Marlena joins in.

</b>          The other couples leave the sky deck to get out of the rain
          and away from "that crazy couple"�.
          Marlena and Jacob stop, wet, panting, laughing from the
          release. Then, looking out at the view, not at each other...

          away from us, from the show. You're
          smart Jacob. You deserve better

          or something terrible's going to
          happen.

          say it all.
          Marlena looks into Jacob's eyes and finally addresses what
          they're both thinking;

</b>          Nothing can ever happen with us,

          don't know what he's capable of.

<b>                         JACOB

          frightened of?

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          I'm not. I don't have to feel
          afraid of him if I don't feel
          anything...After all these years,
          I've learned how to do it so well.
          I tell myself, "I'm managing. I can
          manage him. August loves me. Nobody
          else ever did. Who am I to say it's
          the wrong kind of love?"� .. See,
          there's no place for a woman like
          me in any decent kind of world. You

          The cookhouse tent is divided into two sections by a curtain.
          One one side: working men and the buffet table of food. It is
          made up of benches and bare wood tables with salt and pepper
          shakers.
          The other side of the curtain is filled with performers. The
          tables have a checkered tablecloth and flowers.
          Marlena is sitting alone, drinking a cup of coffee. Jacob
          approaches. He sits opposite her.

          her trunk. August freezes. The crowd laughs uproariously.
          Jacob and the others realize it's all part of the act. Walter
          slaps his back. Barbara kisses his cheek.
          August displays great performance skills. He turns to Rosie
          acting suspicious. Rosie lifts her head away, as if to say
          "It wasn't me"�.
          August turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again,
          Rosie flicks his behind with her trunk. This time August
          knows it her. He turns to her, tips his hat over his brow and
          shakes his finger, scolding, as if to say, "No, no, no"�
          Rosie responds by waving her trunk, mocking him.

          her larger ball.
          Marlena straightens out both arms and extends her other leg,

          Because of him - together with our

          attraction in Benzini Brother's

          and Barbara bring Jacob towels, embracing and kissing him.
          The rest of the company follows suit.
          August motions for Marlena, who retrieves a large mens
          clothing box and carries it to Jacob as August watches from a
          distance...The crowd parts as Marlena hands him the box.
          August watches Jacob open the box to find his own TUXEDO.

          Jacob looks to Marlena. It is awkward between them. They
          can't kiss each other. Jacob nods and says courteously;

          As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching
          from them a distance;
          August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding.

          Marlena and Rosie exits the Big Top. We hear tumultuous
          applause coming from inside. Jacob awaits them, as usual.
          Jacob commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena off his back and
          places her carefully on the ground. Jacob pets and commands
          Rosie to follow him, but stops when:

</b>
          Rosie is staked into the grass inside Marlena's tent, happily
          occupied with a pile of watermelons.
          Marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace.
          There is a serving table with silver domed platters and wine
          bottles. Marlena is trying to open a champagne bottle when
          Jacob enters.

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          Oh, he'll be here any second.
          Jacob, can you open this for me?
          Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork.
          Rosie's trunk is curious, inspecting the bottle in Jacob's
          hand. Jacob laughs. Marlena sees and laughs as well.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Rosie...get away....ssstop!!
          Rosie continues fooling around, causing Marlena and Jacob to
          laugh even harder when the cork pops...

<b>          AUGUST (O.S.)
</b>          What is this?
          Jacob and Marlena turn to see August enter, laying down his
          hat and coat, his shirt unbuttoned at the top.

<b>                         MARLENA/JACOB
</b>
<b>          OH!....SURPRISE!..SURPRISE!
</b>          Jacob pours the champagne into two flutes, which Marlena
          rushes up to August, handing him a glass and kissing him.

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          Did you show Jacob the opening

          August nods in gratitude. They tilt their glasses and drink.

</b>          Many thanks. Forgive me for
          arriving too soon and spoiling the

          August takes out a cigarette and lights it.

          RAID and clear the place out so you

          In a split second, Jacob and Marlena know the danger present.
          August gave no sign of it coming.

<b>                         MARLENA

<b>                         AUGUST
</b>          I'm sorry. I'm probably wrong. I
          assumed that night after the RAID
          was the first time you two fucked,
          but obviously it's been going on
          longer than that.

          tipped cane leaning against the flap. He picks it up as
          Marlena and Jacob remain still. Suddenly they hear:
          Rosie peeing where she is staked. She too is frightened.

<b>                         AUGUST

</b>
<b>          STOP IT!..AUGGIE STOP IT..PLEASE!
</b>          Suddenly, he's quiet. He stands still. Marlena approaches him
          now, cautiously but tenderly.

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
</b>          Auggie? Are you all right now?...
          August looks at her. Marlena's expression is one of care and
          concern. Jacob watches carefully. Has it passed?
          Suddenly, August flicks his lit cigarette into Rosie's open
          mouth - Rosie reacts and Jacob moves to help her - as August
          grabs Marlena, shoving her so hard she falls against the
          table, knocking it and her to the ground. He attacks her,
          trying to rip off her diamond necklace.
          Jacob attacks August, pulling him off of Marlena.
          JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT: savagely pounding each other's faces,
          crashing against broken plates and spilled gravy, banging
          their heads viciously against the ground, rolling over each
          other as they alternately share domination...
          Marlena screams for them to stop. Rosie bellows, pulling on
          her leg chain.
          The FIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE TENT INTO THE CIRCUS GROUNDS.

          August's madness empowers him. He manages to overpower Jacob
          in a choke hold. Jacob is losing consciousness.
          Because of Marlena's screams - Earl and his men run to the
          tent. Within seconds, they are pulling August off of Jacob.
          August gets to his feet. His cool expression is even more

          Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes
          Walter, who sees Jacob's bloodied face and goes to him.
          FROM INSIDE THE TENT, THEY HEAR: Two soft thuds..then a
          louder one...Then an unnerving silence.

          can only manage to shake his head NO...But Walter can read
          between the lines....He lowers his head in despair.
          THE TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE. All three react with surprise.

          Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's
          stares. She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice.

<b>                         MARLENA (CONT'D)

<b>                         WALTER
</b>          Why is the train moving?
          Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking:

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          We're being run out. Apparently,
          August was so optimistic about
          money coming in for Rosie, he
          figured he'd double down and find
          himself a new fat lady to put him
          really toe to toe with
          Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin
          into town who finds this rather
          large woman in a restaurant and
          offers her the job. Except, she...

<b>                         (STARTS LAUGHING)
</b>          ...she was the police chief's wife.
          Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the
          jaw and we got til morning to get
          out of town.
          This cracks everybody up. Laughter. A release of tension.
          But the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of
          their situation sinks in....Marlena looks to Jacob and leans
          into his arms. He holds her, clearly in love, then ushers her
          out of the room for privacy.
          Walter sees what he knew all along. He kisses Queenie:

<b>                         WALTER
</b>          Aw girl. We're all in it now.

<b>          INT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Marlena and Jacob exit Walter's room outside of which Marlena
          placed her small suitcase. They pass by Marlena's horses..

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          Why are you hiding that roustabout?

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Because Blackie and his men don't
          work the performer train and
          they'll red-light him if they find
          him. He can't work anymore.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Does August know where you are?

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          No. He thinks I'm with Barbara and
          the girls. He won't go there.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          He can't find you. As soon as we

          off and I'll take you to a hotel in
          town.

<b>                         MARLENA

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Marlena, I'm not leaving you. We'll
          find a way together. I won't let
          you go back to him. I promise.
          Marlena smiles, needing to hear him say those words. She
          embraces him, grateful. Jacob holds her tight, assuring;

<b>                         JACOB (CONT'D)

          I can take my finals again, get my
          degree, I can get my license.
          They lay in the Silver Star's empty stall. Moonlit through
          the wooden slats. Making plans...

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful.
          You know, I bet Ringling would take
          us both then - they'd be getting a
          vet and a star attraction - that's
          a sweet deal for them. Although I
          won't be a star but I don't care.
          I'll take no billing at all...We'd
          be safe from August if we were with
          Ringling.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Don't worry about him.

<b>                         MARLENA
</b>          Of course, I'd have to wait a while
          until I can work again...

          I know...Is it all right? You can
          change your mind. I'd understand.
          Overwhelmed, Jacob keeps kissing her. Marlena lets go of all
          the anxiety she had about him. He loves her. She knows it.

<b>                         JACOB

          please...please be happy.

          I will...I promise...as soon as I
          stop being terrified.
          Jacob kisses her. He guides her to the ground, against the
          hay. She nestles in his arms.

          A heavy rain pours. A bloodied, battered Jacob is semi-
          conscious face down in a stream in the woods.
          Jacob, his eyes almost swollen shut, wakes out of
          unconsciousness. He looks up through blurred vision.
          Through the trees, he can see A DISTANT FLICKERING RED LIGHT.
          He stands. His knees buckle and he crawls out to the ground.
          He stands again. And he walks out of the woods towards the
          flickering light.
          He stumbles and falls. He rises and fumbles forward...using
          all his strength to get himself out of the woods.

          moves forward. He holds the knife in his mouth...moving like
          a tightrope walker over the wet train roof, as rain pours.
          When he reaches the car's end, he takes a deep breath. With
          all his strength, he leaps across the divide between the cars
          and lands, clinging to the top rail, panting like a dog.

</b>          He removes the knife from his mouth, having cut his lip. He
          licks the blood back and replaces the knife, this time
          keeping his lips retracted.

<b>          JACOB MAKES HIS WAY ACROSS SIX CARS...LEAPING FROM CAR TO CAR
</b>
<b>          BY LANDING ON THE ROOF, GETTING TO HIS KNEES THEN TO HIS FEET
</b>
<b>          AND MOVING ON TO THE NEXT...
</b>

<b>          EXT. ATOP MARLENA AND AUGUST'S STATEROOM CAR - NIGHT
</b>
          Jacob leaps to the roof of Marlena and August's car. At this
          moment, the train is making a curve.
          Jacob climbs down over the side ladder. Beyond him, we see:

<b>          THE TRAIN IS TRAVERSING OVER A TRESTLE, FORTY YARDS ABOVE THE
</b>
<b>          BOULDERS OF A RIVERBANK ILLUMINATED BY MOONLIGHT.
</b>          Jacob jumps to the platform. He can see the rocky waters far
          below the trestle. He catches his breath and waits, as the
          train straightens out onto land again.
          Jacob turns the knob of the door to the stateroom, slowly,
          hearing a click, pausing, then opening it.

<b>          INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          Jacob enters the stateroom, leaving the door open. He creeps
          towards the velvet curtain which is closed. He grips the
          knife. When he reaches it, he pulls the edge and peeks
          inside.
          August is asleep on his side, his arms locked around Marlena,
          who is awake facing the curtain.
          Jacob and Marlena's eyes meet. She sees the knife in his hand
          August suddenly moves, pulls Marlena closer to his chest,
          burying his face in her neck.
          Jacob steps forward, raising the knife. His hands tremble.
          The moonlight glints off the blade, throwing off light.
          Marlena is looking up at him, tears in her eyes. She subtly
          shakes her head "NO"�...She doesn't want him to do this.
          Jacob's hands are shaking now. The knife gripped in his hand.
          He wants to rescue her, he's so close. We hold the moment...
          Marlena's expression convinces Jacob not to do it...not to
          cross that line and kill August.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          113.
</b>          Defeated, Jacob kneels beside her and hangs his head. Marlena
          reaches out to touch him...this time she really is saying
          goodbye. But Jacob can not bear it. He looks at her for the
          last time, then rises and exits.

<b>          INT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
          Jacob returns to the ring stock car, hopping down from the
          roof. The Horses are stirring, agitated. He calms them...
          And then Jacob sees: the door to Walter's room is open. He

<b>                         APPROACHES;
</b>
<b>                         JACOB
</b>          Walter? Camel?

<b>          INT. KINKO'S ROOM/ RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</b>
          Jacob enters to find the room in a shambles. A terrible
          realization comes over him:
          Walter and Camel are gone. They have been red-lighted.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>
<b>          WALTER! CAMEL!!
</b>          He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball. He
          takes her in his arms. Jacob panics.

<b>                         JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>          No..no..no..no....!!!!
          With Queenie, he rushes back into the ring stock car...he
          checks everywhere calling out their names. He stops at the
          open stock car door. The rain continues to fall. Jacob
          collapses, holding Queenie to his chest. Tears fill his eyes
          as he tries to hold it together, looking out the moving
          train, his worst nightmare realized.

</b>
<b>          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          I wanted to believe taking Walter's
          knife didn't make a difference. But
          still. I left him without a

          survived. Maybe they were tossed
          over grassy land...I couldn't let

<b>          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING
</b>
          A sunny day. The circus is completely set up. Townsfolk,
          rubes, are already buying tickets for the matinee.

<b>          JACOB (V.O.)
</b>          I waited almost til matinee time so
          I could let myself be seen by as

<b>          EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING
</b>
          Jacob opens the ring stock car and jumps out, holding
          Queenie. He hasn't slept all night.
          As he walks through the circus grounds, working men like Greg
          and performers like Barbara are shocked to see him alive.
          With a fool's courage, he brazenly walks past Blackie and his
          men, cutting a path through performers and working men, right
          up to August, who stands with Earl at his side. He is dressed
          and ready for the matinee's performance.
          Jacob stops and they exchange looks. August glances at
          Queenie in Jacob's arms. He says nothing.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          I'm not here to cause any trouble.
          I'm leaving.

<b>                         AUGUST

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          I'd like to say goodbye. To the
          menagerie. Just a few minutes and
          then I'll go.
          August's eyes narrow. Earl waits for the outcome.

<b>                         JACOB (CONT'D)
</b>          There's nothing more you can do to
          me. Killing me'll be more trouble
          than it's worth, now that the rubes

</b>          Earl, take him to the menagerie.
          Thirty seconds. Then escort him out
          of my circus, into Altoona. And if
          he comes back, you can shoot him,
          as that is within our lawful rights
          with regards to trespassers.
          August walks away. Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie. On
          the way, they pass Barbara. Jacob pauses to hand Queenie to
          her. She has tears in her eyes. Jacob continues with Earl.

<b>          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - MOMENTS LATER - ALTOONA, PA - DAY
</b>
          Jacob enters alone. He takes in all the animals who look back
          at him. He crosses to Rosie and stands before her. Her trunk
          greets him, stroking him. He presses his head against her.
          Rosie comforts him. It makes Jacob fall apart all the more...
          After a few moments, Jacob turns and walks away. He stops in
          the center of the menagerie. He looks at each animal in their
          den - in the same way as when he first met them - this time
          saying goodbye.
          Each animal is at the front of it's den or cage, looking at
          Jacob. There is a silent exchange between them. Earl enters.

<b>                         EARL
</b>          Come on kid.
          When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens:

<b>          ALL THE ANIMALS BEGIN BANGING AGAINST THEIR CAGES AND SHAKING
</b>
<b>          THEIR BARS OR STOMPING THEIR FEET, SCREECHING OR ROARING OR

<b>          BELLOWING, AS IF IN PROTEST OF THEIR JACOB'S DEPARTURE.
</b>          The lock on Rex's cage busts a little as he rams against it.

<b>          EXT. SIDESHOW TENTS/MIDWAY - ALTOONA, PA - DAY
</b>
          As Earl escorts Jacob, they walk against the tide of audience
          members walking to the Big Top entrance. Earl speaks low.

<b>                         EARL
</b>          It's good you're going. They must
          have known you got back on the

</b>          Walter! Is he---?
          Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news.
          Jacob's breathing almost stops as he listens;

<b>                         EARL
</b>          Keep walking...They got tossed off
          the trestle, if you can believe it.
          Camel's head hit the rocks. He died
          right away...
          Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear. Earl
          pauses for a beat...this part is harder to tell:

</b>          ...Walter...Walter's legs were

          raises her trunk to smile at him. Jacob looks down and sees
          that ROSIE'S STAKE HAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND.
          Jacob fights August to breathe as Rosie reveals she is
          holding the stake loosely, resting it's end on the dirt. The
          chain still attached to her foot.
          Jacob flips himself which forces August to turn his back on
          Rosie in order to keep his grip on Jacob.
          Marlena covers her head in her arms, not wanting to see.
          Jacob can not breathe..August is squeezing the life from him

<b>                         AS:
</b>          Rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it
          down onto August, splitting his head in one clean move. She
          continues to hold the stake until August topples forward,
          dead, his skull opened like a hardboiled egg..
          Released of August, Jacob rolls himself under the ropes just

</b>          Rosie then slides the stake back to the ground. Marlena, head
          hidden under her arms, sees nothing. The menagerie is clear
          of the stampeding animals.
          Marlena lifts her head up from beneath her arms, remaining
          under Rosie. She sees August lifeless body. She looks to
          Jacob. He rises, bloodied and beaten, but alive.
          WIDE ANGLE: The empty menagerie except for: Jacob standing,
          Marlena under Rosie and the two monkeys inspecting August's
          dead body.

</b>          Do you have any proof?
          Jacob is stalled. Greg appears.

<b>                         GREG
</b>          He's right. He's just an elephant

</b>          You don't want her anyway. She

          Nesci with her trunk. Then checks his pockets for treats.

          Jacob is finishing his story. Charlie is enthralled. The
          first bottle of scotch is gone. The second half full.

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          I convinced my dean to let me take
          my finals. Marlena was right. With
          my degree, our animals and
          Marlena's acts, Ringling got a
          sweet deal. Our son was born our
          first season. We named him Walter.
          He spent the first seven years of
          his life with Ringling.

</b>          By the time our third son came,

          A KNOCK. Charlie peeks through the window and sees a COP:

</b>          Hi Officer, can I help you?

<b>                         COP
</b>          Yes, I'm hoping you can. An elderly
          gentleman went missing from the
          nursing home down the street. Staff
          seems to think he came here.

          today. But no, I haven't seen him.
          The Cop peers past Charlie and sees Jacob.

<b>                         COP
</b>          Excuse me, but who is that?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>          (Pause, then)
          Oh....that's my Dad.
          The Cop is suspicious. Charlie covers:

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          He can't talk. Had a major stroke a
          few years back. But he's doing
          well. Ain't ya Pop?
          Understanding the ruse, Jacob starts to play the part of a
          stroke victim: he opens his mouth, his jaw quivers. He
          reaches for his glass with a shaking arm. Charlie helps him.
          Jacob holds out his tongue like a parrot's as Charlie helps
          him drink. The Cop watches with a blank expression. Jacob
          swallows and nods speechless, smiles and manages to drool.
          Beat. The Cop wonders. Then, pulling out his card:

<b>                         COP
</b>          OK, well, thanks for your time.
          Here's my number in case you hear
          of anything. Sorry to bother you.
          The Cop exits. Charlie returns to sit opposite Jacob. They
          consider this unspoken proposal:

<b>                         JACOB
</b>          You sure about this?
          Beat as Charlie pours another shot. Then:

</b>          I wonder if we can get you into the

          coming home.

          Old Jacob uses his walker to enter the menagerie. He moves to
          each animal meeting his eyes with theirs. Each animal gives
          him a look of acknowledgment.
          He comes to an ORANGUTAN...younger than the one from his
          Benzini days. Jacob stops. He steadies himself.
          Jacob lets go of the walker and reaches his arm out to the
          Orangutan's cage.
          The Orangutan studies him for a moment. Judging.
          Jacob keeps his arm extended, which isn't easy for him.
          The Orangutan then extends his hand through the bars to
          Jacob's hand.
          Jacob's fingers entwine around the Orangutan's hand. They
          hold for a moment. Jacob smiles.
