<b>    MAP GRIDS

    From the pages of a Thomas guide converge, overlap and re-
    configure across the screen. The endlessly ironic names of
    American suburbs parade before us, their violet territories
    marching forward like a bruise into dark green patches of
    forest and wilderness.

    Closer in on one last map grid which fades into a
    transparency of itself overlaid across the actual location of
    the suburb. The name of this housing development is "Pleasant
    Valley". The transparency fades out to reveal:

</b>
    From a sign reading "Pleasant Valley Dream Homes", a picture
    postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity.

    Each home is brand new. Each has the same size lawn, the same
    shrubs, the same satellite dish. Each has an
    indistinguishable car parked in the driveway.

    All the homes have Christmas decorations, Christmas trees
    with baubles, lights and Christmas stars sitting proudly at
    the top. The doors have Christmas wreaths.

    The sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer
    in the lights.

    We halt outside one house.

    This home too seems perfect until we notice the Christmas
    star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting
    itself in a puddle on the wet lawn.

    Suddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl
    among the branches of the Christmas tree. It rises from the
    tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse
    from the grass. The owl then soars off, casting a magnified
    shadow of her wings across the house, and disappears with
    it's prey into the woods behind.

    Curtains part at a downstairs window. The silhouette of a man
    appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen. He
    draws the curtains once again and disappears.

        KENNETH, a forty something ex-jock with a once handsome face,
        pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass. Kenneth's eyes are
        glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll
        endlessly down. He highlights a set of numbers and stands up
        abruptly from his chair elated.

<b>                            KENNETH
</b>                  Yes!

        Steps back onto a A CHILD'S DOLL, crushing it underfoot. His
        ebullient mood changes quickly.

<b>                            KENNETH (CONT'D)
</b>                  Damn! DELLA!

        The sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening.
        DELLA peers into the room. She's a diminutive blonde in her
        thirties with fine features and a fading Southern accent.
        She's pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans.

        She sees the broken doll.

<b>                            DELLA
</b>                  SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's
                  favorite doll.

        She walks in, picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed
        face. He turns back to the computer guiltily, takes a sip of
        beer.

<b>                            KENNETH

                  get it over with. Do you think the
                  kids don't know what you mean?

        Close up, his face is ruddy - the face of someone who drinks
        too much. He turns back towards her. She ignores him,
        continues to try fix the doll. His eyes linger on her coat.

                  reading group?

        He averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look
        at her once more.

                  have the curse. There's a Tuesday
                  night class at the Pleasant Valley
                  Episcopalian.

        Kenneth clearly thinks he's funny. Della glares a warning at
        him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping
        from her mouth.

<b>                            DELLA
</b>                  I'm going to the mall for wrapping
                  paper.

        A trail of kids mess in the hallway behind Della catches
        Kenneth's eye.

<b>                            KENNETH
</b>                  What do you do all day, Della
                  honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping
                  house. This place is an eyesore.
                  I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs
                  for this?

        His sad eyes meet hers in confrontation. Della, determined
        not to engage, averts hers. Kenneth, unable to contain
        himself, faces her.

<b>                            KENNETH (CONT'D)
</b>                  I mean it's not like you're at some
                  salon fancying up your hair or
                  nails like the other men's wives.

        He lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop,
        looks right in her tired face.

                  party. God, Della, you used to be
                  hot!

        She bites her lip again, but this time to try stop the tears.
        He turns away, in an attempt to conceal his own sadness.

        She walks away clutching the doll.

        But she's already left the room. He watches her pick up a set
        of car keys from a dresser in the dimly lit hallway. Her
        knuckles are white as she clenches her fingers around them.

        Kenneth turns back to his computer.

        Della climbs the stairs. Framed photographs on the wall tell
        the public story of her life. The engagement to Kenneth,
        their wedding, the birth of the twins, Kenneth's graduation,
        Kenneth as a sixth grade football star, Della on the farm in
        Ohio with her horse, a really young Della playing baseball
        with her father. We linger on a photo of a very pretty twenty
        something Della in a little black dress.

        TERRI and TAMMI are seven year old twins with the delicate
        blue eyed blonde looks of their Mother.

        Della stands in the doorway and watches them.

        Tammi is lying on her girlish bed drawing with crayons.
        Terri's toy dinosaurs are destroying Tammi's heirloom dolls
        house, starting with the furniture.

        She steps into the room.

        loves so much.

        She smiles. Terri's already turned back to his dinosaurs.
        Tammi runs toward her and gives her the drawing she's been
        working on. It's a drawing of a stick figure family holding
        hands. The words "Mommy, we love you" are written across a
        cloudy night sky like big stars.

        Della doesn't have time to look at it properly so she folds
        the drawing up and puts it in her pocket. She kisses Tammi
        again and turns to leave. Tammi's eyes follow her mother as

        She turns the heat up high and warms her hands at the vent,

        second, in an upstairs window, she sees a reflection of
        Tammi.

        She smiles, then looks at the house and lawn and the

      lets it lay on her lap.

      She rakes about among a bunch of kids stuff in the back seat,
      casts aside, an anorak, mittens, a sock.

      She finds what she's looking for, a bottle of water, caught
      on the bar under the passenger seat. It's only a third full

      abruptly ends and a wasteland of deforestation begins.

      A billboard for another new housing development announces:

      Waiting for the light at the opposite side of the road from

      An Escape midway down the row blocks traffic. It's waiting
      for a Subaru to pull out so it can take the spot.

      Della shakes her head and turns left into row five. Jesus!
      Are there really this many cars in Pleasant Valley? It's a
      brand new Mall and the only one around for miles but this is
      ridiculous.

      Della reaches the end of row five quickly. She guessed there
      wouldn't be a spot so she's driving faster.

      She notices a portly middle aged RENT-A-COP directing traffic

      She sets off marching across the lot, taking what seems to be
      the most direct route. Maybe she can shake off this mood by
      the time she gets inside.

      She passes the Plymouth, turns, stares back at it. The car is
      dirty gold and riddled with rust holes with a vinyl roof
      that's almost peeled away. She walks up close, tries to
      decipher the plate, but it's caked with mud.

      She finds herself reaching into her purse, rummaging for a

      writes.

      She scans her words.    Pretty good!

      Della rips the piece of paper from the notebook, folds the
      note several times and slides it under the Plymouth's
      windshield wipers. The driver can't miss it.

      She smiles. That felt good!

      Head held high she marches on towards the Mall.

      The CAMERA pulls up so we can see the mall, see Della
      marching across the lot, see the crowds of shoppers entering
      and exiting the mall, and get the feeling that maybe somebody
      just saw her.

      A wave of heat and Christmas lights hits Della. A wave of
      nausea follows as she is swallowed by the crowd of last
      minute shoppers. Distorted muzak versions of Christmas songs
      seep from invisible speakers.

      Della gets caught up in a line of children waiting to see
      Santa in his grotto. She squeezes through and makes her way
      towards the fountain outside of Victoria's Secret.

      En route she is stopped by a perfume sales lady who sprays
      her wrist with perfume before she has time to protest.

      Della arrives at the fountain. A piddling jet of dirty water
      gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down
      into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes. She scans
      the crowd but there's no sign of Cassie.

      Della sits at the edge of the fountain. She checks her watch
      then checks out the people milling around in front of
      Victoria's Secret, where mannequins in skimpy festive
      underwear are propped seductively in the window displays.

      Still no sign of Cassie. She's about to make a wish and throw
      a quarter into the fountain when a Red Cross worker shakes
      her "Save the Children" tin at her. Della sticks the quarter
      into the tin instead.

      examine slim fit underpants and padded bras.

      She notices a pure silk black teddy, very classic, no frills.
      She lifts it from the rail and holds it against herself in

      It's a lot less crowded now. The melancholy "Home for
      Christmas" plays. She follows the ladies sign to the entrance
      to the bathroom, only to find an "Out of Order" sign on the
      door. She sees a cleaning lady in the corridor.

      The    cleaning lady disappears through the bathroom door with
      her    cart of cleaning utensils. Della looks down the length of
      the    huge mall and decides she's not even going to try to find
      the    other bathroom. She can wait until she gets home.

      She makes her way towards the exit, pulls her coat in tight
      and braces herself for the cold front outside.

      A group of CAROL SINGERS sing "Silent Night".

<b>                          CAROL SINGERS
</b>                Silent Night. Holy Night. All is
                calm. All is bright.

      Della listens for a moment. Their voices are clear and
      bright.

      Behind them she can see the Christmas tree vendor bag up the
      left over trees.

      Della's hands start to pinch with the cold.

      She gathers her bags of wrapping paper and sets off across
      the emptying lot. The last of the shoppers rush across the
      car park to find their cars. It's pretty dark between the dim
      pole lamps and the car lights.

      She slows down at the second aisle for a car to pass, then
      another. Marches on.

      A man and his little girl walk past. He nods. Della's eyes
      linger on the little girl. She really wants to get home to
      the kids.

      The singers' voices echo faintly through the night.

      She walks faster, almost at a dash.

      Where is her car? Even further out than she remembered,
      that's for sure.

      A car alarm goes off in the distance.

      The alarm stops at last as Della approaches the outer section
      of the parking lot.

      She cuts between some of the cars in row eight. Zigzags
      across aisle nine. Notices the Plymouth still parked ahead.

      She stops for a split second. Then approaches. Glances at the
      windshield. The note is gone.

      Maybe it fell off. She checks the ground around the car. No
      sign of it. She shrugs, who cares anyway?

      She cuts across the next aisle. It's almost empty. And the
      one after that. Her Explorer is sandwiched between two cars
      in this otherwise empty row.

      Della turns the key in the ignition and presses in the
      lighter. She lights a cigarette and inhales as she lets the
      car warm up for 30 seconds.

      She rests the cigarette in the ashtray while she releases the
      hand brake and slips the gear into reverse. The interior of
      her car is suddenly flooded with light from another car's
      headlights. She glances in the rear view mirror. A car is
      blocking her.

      She steps on the brake and waits for the car to move.

      But it doesn't. Its headlights flick to full beam blinding
      her view in her car mirrors. She honks her horn. The car
      still doesn't move.

      Della's really angry now. She slips the gearshift into park
      and steps out of her car.

      Della squints in the blinding headlights. The front of the
      car looks familiar. It's the gold Plymouth!

      Two unseen car doors click open and clunk shut again.

      The lights abruptly go out. Della blinks, her eyes try to
      adjust to the dim mercury illumination from a pole lamp a few
      car lengths away.

      She uneasily turns back to her car.

      The words are emphasized by another boy's shrill giggling.
      Della freezes. This can't be happening!

      Her eyes are adjusting. The glare phantoms drift out to the
      limit of her peripheral vision and vanish.

      in his fur trimmed jacket and Russian style cap. It's the
      same guy Della approached earlier when she was looking for
      spaces except this time his hand is laying casually across

      Chuckie shoots him in the face.

      We thought Della was in trouble but now we know she is.

      The bullet hits the Rent-A-Cop in the forehead. Blood spurts
      from the exit wound. He slumps to the asphalt like a
      marionette whose strings have just been cut. Bullet smoke
      hangs in the air where he once stood. Smoke too blackens the
      bullets entry wound. Blood puddles out from the back of his
      head.

      his face.

      All stand riveted in shock.

      Chuckie looks to his friends for support but none is
      forthcoming.

      The Rent-A-Cop's body twitches.

      Chuckie hesitates then raises the gun. He aims and fires. The
      shot shatters the top of the Rent-A-Cop's head. Chuckie
      flinches, closes his own eyes in reflex.

      Della swallows. If she started screaming now, she may never
      stop. She spins instead and makes for her car door. She's
      dead if she doesn't get out of here and she knows it.

<b>                          VINH

      the accelerator pedal   to the metal.

      The Explorer barely protests as its front tires claw and
      bounce over the six inch concrete row barrier. The barrier

      a silver chain necklace from the rearview mirror, to crash

      She stands stock still, listening, scanning the landscape for
      a sign of them.

      The sound of glass shattering breaks the silence.

      Della jumps out of her skin, spins around. Her eyes settle on
      a light in the distance.

      The light illuminates the small cabin of an earth moving
      truck. The cabin glows like a box in the darkness. There's a
      figure inside: it's Chuckie. He's inspecting a powerful
      construction flashlight. He switches settings from broad
      light to concentrated beam. He points the beam through the
      broken glass window onto Tomas, who's standing on a truck
      tyre knocking out the rest of the glass with his elbow.
      Chuckie leaps down through the broken window, pleased with
      his find.

      He switches it to broad beam, whistles.

                now. This baby could spot a needle
                in a haystack!

      The light dances around illuminating each of their faces for
      seconds at a time. Eerie distorted glimpses. They're
      traipsing along the rough road, through the mud, towards
      Della. Their voices grow louder.

      Chuckie is taken aback by what Huey is saying. He walks away,
      turns his concentration back to the flashlight. Huey calls
      after him.

      Beyond the rows of plots of land with their sold signs, she
      sees the boys still pacing and debating beside her Ford,
      illuminated by the sweeping light rays of their flashlight.

      Her eyes drift across the landscape of house foundations and
      structures to the distant neon lights of the shopping mall.

      When she looks back over for the boys, she sees that the
      flashlight and the boys are gone.

      She strains her eyes. Guesses that must mean they're off
      looking for her in another direction.

      She clutches the tool box and silently creeps between the
      houses.

      If she could just track along the edge of the development she
      could maybe make it back to the Shopping Mall, to the twins.

      An owl hoots from the trees behind. She freezes, eyes
      sweeping the immediate area for danger.

      She waits a moment, silence, then makes her way once more
      between the edge of the development and the edge of the
      trees.

      She's trying desperately not to make a sound, praying to be
      invisible, eyes darting around, evaluating every shape and
      form.

      On one side the dense wood of trees, predominantly pine, with
      thick ancient trunks and tangled branches. On the other,
      plots and structures of homes to be.

      She keeps trudging on, skirting the edge of the trees,
      following the lights in the distance.

      She hears a loud thudding noise. Stops. Stops breathing.

      rakes around some more, trying to find something else,
      something more dangerous, anything. To her surprise the only
      tools inside are a pathetic little screwdriver and a small
      crescent wrench. The kids must have borrowed the other tools

      Chuckie then lowers the flashlights direction and sweeps it
      voyeuristically down across her body.

      to illuminate them both. Tomas drains the last dregs from a
      bottle of Bud, tosses the empty bottle down into the

      Chuckie keeps the light focused right on her.

      Tomas slides his index finger down across Della's neck
      towards her breasts.

      Della claws at Tomas' face with the nails of her free hand.
      He staggers to the side holding his cheek and cursing. Her
      chewed nails haven't left any dents, but she stunned him.

      The others laugh.

      She shrugs the coat back over her shoulders and pulls it
      tight across herself, once again clasping the toolbox close
      to her side.

      Tomas glares at Della, then lowers his arm. Spits on the
      ground instead. Turns back to the boys. Chuckie moves
      forwards and focuses on Della's box?

      Chuckie nods to Vinh. Vinh passes his lighter to Chuckie.
      Chuckie lights the licence on fire. The plastic burns black
      and toxic. The flame annihilates Della's name, her date of
      birth, her face. Pieces of plastic unfurl and drift up
      through the empty windows and doors of the unfinished house.

      Della stares defiantly, fighting back the internal nausea
      caused by this symbolically brutal act.

      Chuckie maneuvers the light back in her eyes then right back
      on his own menacing face. Then, back again on her face. She
      becomes disoriented.

      She knows there is nothing that would buy them off and the

      Chuckie follows her face with the beam. She tries to dodge
      its glare in her eyes. But he maneuvers it like a
      surveillance camera.

      His voice takes on a meanness that makes the back of her neck
      tingle.

      Della's brain races.

      Her hands move slowly.

      She rests the lug wrench in her left palm under the base of
      the tool box and with her right hand unsnaps the catch.

      She holds the far end of the lid up to shield her right hand
      from the beam as she slips it inside the box.

      A prayer plays silently across her lips as her fingers feel
      the cool steel and shape of the small crescent wrench.

      She curls them around its handle and grips tight. A surge of
      nervous energy courses through her veins.

<b>                          TOMAS

      He moves towards her.

      In a flash, she withdraws the crescent wrench. She cocks her
      wrist back and hurls the tool, snaps it just like her daddy
      taught her to play baseball.

      The wrench flies up and across the house.

      With a CRUNCH, it catches Chuckie right in the collar bone,
      right side.

      He screams. Drops the flashlight. Drops to his knees holding
      his throat.

      Della snaps the tool box shut and makes a run for it. She
      throws herself up onto the first floor and darts between
      Tomas and Huey.

      Huey lunges for her but trips over a loose plank, lands with
      his face down, biting on the plank's edge.

      Della catches a peripheral glimpse of Tomas leaping towards
      her, but his leading foot slams down instead onto the back of
      Huey's neck. Grinds Huey's face into the plank with a hideous
      THUD. Huey's neck SNAPS back smiley style. Huey's scream
      gurgles into the night. Huey's body falls through the space
      in the floorboards landing with a thud in the foundations
      below.

      Tomas falls away, cursing in horror.

      Della makes a run for the doorway. She jumps down onto the
      muddy lot and heads off across the development. The darkness
      quickly swallows her.

      Behind her, Vinh slumps through the house.

      He pushes Chuckie gently out of the way so he can see.

      He stares down at Huey's bloody meshed face. Tomas staggers
      backwards and crosses himself.

      Della runs for her life. She makes straight for the cover of
      the trees. She hesitates for just a moment after the first
      layer of Pines. It's pitch black beyond. Then she steps in.

      She follows her breath into the icy blackness.

      Branches and foliage scratch against her face.

      She grapples about, looking for hiding places between the
      dark shapes and forms. Steps between tree roots and shrubs.

      Her eyes begin to adjust. She can now make out the
      difference between the clumps of darkness and tell, looking
      back, where the edge of the woods begins. A construction
      light shines behind like a distant moon.

      She pushes between the branches of indistinguishable trees,
      some thick and knotted, others slight and brittle. Only the
      evergreens still have their foliage.

      Looking back constantly to the edge of the trees for a sign
      of the boys.

      Fear drives her further into the woods towards where the
      trees grow even more densely together. Where there just may
      be the right place to hide.

      She stops for a second to catch her breath.

      The handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm. She
      changes hands.

      God, that boy Huey! He really died back there. She heard the
      sound of it. The horrific sound of him dying a stupid
      pointless death.

      It could have been her.

      There has to be some way out of this nightmare.

      Ahead, a dead tree with spectral branches blocks her path.
      She steps around its huge trunk and tangle of roots.

<b>                          CHUCKIE
</b><b>                DELLA!

      Chuckie's voice drifts towards her.   She ducks down among the
      roots.

      Her eyes scan the darkness.

      No moving shapes nor forms. No sound. No flashlight. Just
      shadowy clumps of trees.

      Should she stay put or should she run?

      Then she sees it. The flashlight weaving through the pines
      ahead.

      She pushes further in among the roots, tries to make herself
      invisible.

      The flashlight beam sweeps across the forest floor towards
      her. One set of footsteps crunches through the foilage.

      She holds still, terrified.

      The flashlight pauses on the dead tree, the roots.

      Della stops breathing.

      Then, the light sweeps past and on into the woods.

      She waits until it disappears before stepping out of her
      hiding place.

      She creeps back in the opposite direction, figuring if
      they're in the woods now she should get out.

      Her eyes search for the construction light, which indicates
      the edge of the wood.

      She heads in the direction of the light, painfully aware that
      one noisy footfall could alert her pursuers. She steps
      between leaves and roots as delicately as a ballet dancer.

      The construction light grows closer.

      The light abruptly goes out.

      She stops, eyes desperately searching the trees.

      She resumes in the direction she was headed. Tries to keep
      calm.

      But the woods are impenetrable. Layers of trees and shrubs,
      and then more trees. Deep in the cold dark places there are
      patches of left over snow. She's losing her bearings.

      Ahead, the chilling sight of four luminous Xs glowing in the

      them for death. She shivers.

      She backs up, starts off in the opposite direction.

      And there it is again. The flashlight sweeping through the
      trees in the distance.

      She stops, close to screaming, then when the flashlight
      disappears, runs off in yet another direction.

      She slows to take a breath, notices the butts of several
      cigarettes still smoking in the dirt close to her feet.

      She trudges on, pushing between the branches, no clue where
      she is headed.

      The further she treads, the quieter it becomes. So quiet she
      can hear her own footfalls and the sound of the trees
      breathing.

      Then, she spots the light again, in the distance, shining out
      over the forest.

      shrubs to help pull herself up.

      The woodland ahead slopes down into a clearing, where a huge
      ghetto blaster sits on a pile of felled trees. Young pines
      about to become Christmas trees. It's blasting out a hip hop
      anthem for a dead homie. A construction light illuminates the
      clearing.

      A ghostly Vinh, head hung low, moves to the music, bottle of
      beer in hand.

      Propped up against a tree stump sits the body of Huey, arms
      crossed over his torso, hood pulled up to cover his face.

      The scene is so surreal that Della is drawn closer. She
      creeps along the edge of the trees.

      As she moves, she kicks back on some dirt. It tumbles
      downhill into the gulch. She freezes.

      But nobody notices.

      She slips invisibly between the trees and watches as Tomas
      enters the clearing.

       Tomas stops and watches Vinh.

       Vinh continues to get into the music in his solemn Japanese
       punk style. The juxtaposition between the hard core rap music
       and the serious vibe that Vinh is sending out shows us that
       this is really important music to him.

       It's a theatrical tableau -

       Della overhead, looking down on the clearing.

       Vinh transfixed by the music.

       Tomas stone silent, watching Vinh.

       It plays out for a poignant moment. Like they're all part of
       some spiritual rite about to be consummated.

       Vinh pours some beer onto the ground at Huey's feet. A small
       tear runs down his stoic face.

       Then CLICK. The blaster is abruptly turned off by Chuckie who
       appears out of the shadows behind it.

       He stares a beat at Vinh like he can't believe what he's been
       seeing.

       Vinh keeps on moving like he's in a trance.

       Vinh doesn't reply. Stares down at the ground, keeps on with
       his weird dance. Chuckie moves towards him. Tomas grabs
       Chuckie, tries to stop him from going for Vinh, but Chuckie
       shrugs him off.

       Chuckie reaches out and shakes Vinh. No response. He shakes

       starts dancing again.

       Chuckie loses it. He slaps Vinh.

       Vinh rubs his face. He's getting a grip all right. Chuckie
       slams off the blaster.

                 men of respect.

       The three boys stand somberly in silence, each paying
       internal homage to their dead friend. Chuckie hardens his
       heart against the tears that threaten to flow. Tomas
       trembles, mumbles.

       Della's been watching the scene unfold, a captive audience,
       attentive and terrified.

       Slowly she tears her eyes away from the boys. She backs away
       from the edge and right into the sharp branch of a big old
       tree. The branch digs into that point in her shoulder she
       hurt earlier on the barbed wire.

       She reaches up to feel it and pulls her hand away bloody. She
       reaches into her coat pockets for a tissue. Nothing. Feels
       something in her pants pocket.

       She pulls out not a tissue but a sheet of folded paper.

       She unfolds it. It's Tammi's drawing. The one from the
       beginning.

       The stick figure family holding hands and "Mommy - We love
       you" written in stars.

       Della's lost in the drawing. Her eyes drink in every mark and
       color and word. She sees that the male figure is slightly
       separate. That the children stick figures have frightened
       eyes and cling to the female. That the sky is turbulent. The
       stars clear and bright. The words...

       A tear escapes from underneath her eyelid. Then another. A
       sob.

       She might never see her kids again.

       Another sob. She heaves with the release of emotion.

       More tears escape. Another sob. She tries to bite it back.
       Wills herself to stop.

       Finds that rage takes sorrow's place. Rage and self
       recrimination.

       Goddamit! She's gonna be raped and killed because of some
       stupid note! And God knows what will become of the kids.

       Kenneth always told her she had a temper. That she reacts
       without thinking of the consequences. This time the bastard
       was right.

       She looks again at the picture.

       Chuckie's voice booms out into the night.

       She folds the picture up carefully and puts it back in her
       pocket.

       Della edges further into the trees and disappears into the
       darkness.

       There's rustling in the darkness. Tomas pushes through the
       edge of the trees, making animal calls with his right hand
       curled around his mouth. The flashlight illuminates him from
       behind.

       Chuckie follows him operating the light in a mockery of
       classic noir style. Vinh slouches behind them.

       Tomas heads along the ledge, straight past the spot where
       Della stood only moments before. Tomas doubles back.

       Thomas stops, sniffs.

       Chuckie points the flashlight towards where the ledge ends
       and a steep incline begins.

       Vinh plods clumsily down the incline, followed by Tomas.

       Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch looking for a
       sign of Della.

       Chuckie shifts his focus to climb down the steep slope. As
       the light sweeps back across the gulch we catch a glimpse of
       Della between some rocks at the far side. But the boys' eyes
       are elsewhere, focused on the steep incline ahead of them.

       Della quickly ducks, draws her toolbox in tight and crouches
       low between the rocks. She watches the boys carefully as they
       climb down the gulch.

       There's the sound of a stumble followed by a splash.

       Chuckie sweeps the flashlight towards them. Della sees Vinh
       trudging out of the stream, Tomas descending the last few
       feet of the other side of the gulch and Chuckie midway up.

       Vinh jumps up and down trying to kick the water out of his
       sneakers.

       Chuckie jumps down from the last rock and joins Vinh and

       He hands the flashlight over to Vinh. Vinh reaches for it.
       Chuckie pulls it away.

       Tomas smirks. Vinh hangs his head down. They search for more
       prints, can't find any in the immediate area. Chuckie shines
       the flashlight at the foot of a big rock.

       A beat. Della clutches the lug wrench in her right hand.

       Vinh shivers violently.

       Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch. Della ducks.

       Della needs to get out of there and fast.

       They begin to ascend the rocks. Chuckie keeps the flashlight
       slightly ahead of them.

       Della crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks, keeping
       as low as she can. Dodging the approaching light.

       The boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the
       dexterity of animals. Della's so low she's scraping her knees
       and hands to shreds.

       She can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin.
       What was she thinking hiding here? It was too exposed.

       God please help her make it back into the cover of the trees.

       Della almost vomits.

       Her hand grasps the last rock at the top of the gulch. She
       pushes the toolbox up on the ledge. Her strength is ebbing
       but she tries to hoist herself up. The flashlight sweeps by.
       She lets go of the ledge and ducks. The flashlight sweeps by
       again.

       She huddles in behind a rock. Waits a beat.

<b>                           TOMAS (CONT'D)
</b>                 You going home in a casket tonight.

       Oh shit, they're approaching fast. She tries again to hoist
       herself up. She's almost up when the flashlight sweeps by
       again.

       This time, it catches her.

<b>                           CHUCKIE

       She practically throws herself over the ledge. Tomas scurries
       to the top faster than lightening, catches her leg as she
       crawls from the edge.

       THUD. She kicks him in the face.

       Della grabs the toolbox. Makes a run for it.

       rocks. The rocks tumble downhill, hit Vinh.

<b>                              VINH

       Chuckie scales the gulch behind them. Vinh rubs his head.
       Sees something between the trees. Thinks it's Huey.

<b>                              VINH (CONT'D)

       He starts towards the brush.

<b>                           VINH (CONT'D)
</b>                 Is that you, homie?

       Chuckie catches up with Vinh, breathless from climbing fast.
       Vinh points into the brush.

<b>                           VINH (CONT'D)
</b>                 I saw Huey, there in the brush.

       Chuckie looks around, hoping against hope that Vinh may be
       right, that Huey may just be alive. Vinh becomes perplexed.

<b>                              VINH
</b>                 I saw him.

<b>                           CHUCKIE
</b>                 Sure you did, bro.

       Chuckie puts his arm around Vinh and helps him up the rock
       side. Vinh is shivering so hard he's almost sobbing.

       Just ahead Tomas pulls himself up and over the ledge.

       Tomas catches up with Della, chases her into the trees.
       Behind him Vinh hoists himself up over the ledge, then
       Chuckie.

       Della runs. Faster than she's ever run before. Practically
       flies through the trees.

       Her breath comes hard. His too, just behind her. Their
       footfalls crash into the foliage.

       It's dark, so dark. She's running blindly.

       And they're right behind her. Tomas swipes at her. He just
       misses. He swipes again.

       A twisted shape looms ahead, almost blocks her path.

       She runs right up to it then darts left at the last moment,
       setting up Thomas who's right behind her.

       Tomas runs into the stump of a big old tree trunk, hits
       himself at groin level. He doubles over in pain.

       Thomas gathers himself together, picks up the chase.

       But that moment's delay has bought her some time.

       Her adrenaline pumps hard. Eyes darting for a hiding place
       among the dark shapes and planes of the woods.

       There it is, a deadwood pile.

       She throws herself down into its midst. The dried branches
       jag and tear at her hands and face. She burrows down low, so
       low she's right in the dirt. She peers between the branches.

       Tomas's feet run by and disappear. She hears him circle the
       area then turn back towards her.

       A moment passes. She picks the next. Rises slowly and softly
       from between the jagged branches clutching the lug wrench.

       And then there he is. Diving out of the trees towards her.

       Della raises the lug wrench.

       In the clouded moonlight it's an almost biblical image: a
       woman rising from the brush wielding an iron black cross.

       Tomas crashes towards her.

       Della swings the lug wrench, hard, intensely, directly at
       Tomas's face.

       There is a THUD as the sharp arm of the lug wrench catches
       him up under the chin. It sends him reeling.

       He goes down face first.

       Della gasps in horror, watches as:

       Tomas pulls himself up onto his feet, comes towards her once
       more.

       Della swings the lug wrench back and strikes him across the
       head.

       He spins, clutches at his head, then reaches towards her
<b>       AGAIN.
</b>
       She loses it. She swings the lug wrench towards him.    All the
       years of pent up rage finally find their release.

       The wrench catches up under his nose with a sickening CRUNCH.
       It drives the cartilage up and into his face.

       Blood spurts from the wound. He staggers backwards.

       A shocked scream escapes from Della's mouth.

       As she staggers backwards in the opposite direction.

       Tomas crashes back into a tree. He loses consciousness. His
       body slumps slowly down the tree trunk to the dirt. Blood
       gushes from where the wrench meets his face. He looks like
       he's dressed for Halloween.

       Della just stares. Stares at Tomas, at what she did, what she
       had to do.

       Tomas' eyes are wide open, staring too, at nothing, dead.

       The horror of having killed someone overwhelms Della. She
       starts shaking with shock.

       Vinh cries out for Tomas

       Della tears herself away from Tomas's body and staggers into
       the deadwood to collect the toolbox. It glints, even in the
       darkness.

       She grabs it and runs for cover behind a tree.

       Behind her in the near distance the chaotic sweeps of the
       flashlight illuminates Vinh and Chuckie as they march through
       the woods searching for Tomas.

                 He got her strung up from a tree by
                 now and you know it.

       But Chuckie doesn't look so sure. Vinh charges ahead into the
       darkness.

       Della flashes briefly into shot, running between the trees.
       The flashlight sweeps by.

<b>                           VINH
</b>                 There's something over here.

       Chuckie walks towards Vinh. Vinh takes the flashlight from
       Chuckie and shines it towards a thick shape between three
       trees.

<b>                           VINH (CONT'D)
</b>                 It looks like a body.

       They close in on a muddle of shapes, bush and spidery tree
       trunks. The flashlight illuminates a tree trunk long and
       thick as a body.

<b>                           CHUCKIE
</b>                 It's a big old tree trunk, you
                 paranoid gook.

       Chuckie tries to take the flashlight back from Vinh but Vinh
       won't give it. Chuckie doesn't persist. Vinh keeps going,
       shivering and blustering.

       Vinh senses something. He shines the flashlight behind the
       tree trunk. Still nothing. Sweeps back.

       Della darts between the evergreens behind them. She conceals
       herself in between the trunks and branches. Braces herself,
       waits for the right moments, the ones when they're not
       looking, to run between the trees. Cognizant enough to know
       they just want to find Tomas right now. She seems to be on
       autopilot, becoming numb as the minutes stretch on.

       She watches Vinh plod forward and through the brush. He hits
       every inch of it with the flashlight. Sighs. Doubles back to
       follow Chuckie.

       Then, the flashlight catches a glimpse of something. Sweeps
       back, illuminates Tomas's dead body, splayed out on the mud
       at the foot of the tree, eyes staring wide, bloody, ghastly.

       Tomas's Catholic cross pendant glimmers in the flashlight.

       Silence until Vinh falls to his knees in front of Tomas,
       tries to speak but only a whisper comes out.

<b>                           VINH

</b>

       Chuckie realizes from Vinh's demeanor that something really
       is wrong. He hesitates a moment, then rushes over to Vinh,
       stares too at Tomas's body, gulps back the desire to scream.

       He punches his fist hard into the tree behind Tomas' body
       instead. A shower of pine needles rains down on them.

       Chuckie grabs the flashlight and sweeps it away from the
       body, grabs Vinh's arm, grounding him.

       Vinh sobs and shakes.

<b>                           VINH (CONT'D)

       Chuckie chokes up despite himself.

       He stands up, brushes the pine needles off his tee shirt.

       He paces back and forth.

       He pulls the gun out from deep in his jeans.

       Della creeps between the trees behind them. She appears for a
       second or two, like a ghost, behind the next tree.

       Chuckie defiantly fights back tears.

       Della darts between the trees, faster now. Their voices
       follow her.

       She staggers deeper and deeper into the forest, into the

                  ghosts bleed.

       She hears a faint gurgle.

       She slows, listens. It's the burble of a stream..

       She listens hard. Traces the sound. Treads towards it.

       There it is. Glistening, even in the dark.

       She steps between rocks, walks straight into the stream
       below.

       She stands ankle deep in the icy water with her eyes closed
       clutching the toolbox.

       The water gurgles faintly below her, so cold it almost sounds
       like glass breaking.

       The ghastly images of what just happened play out behind her
       eyes like an inerasable movie of the psyche to be remembered
       for all time.

         She's talking to herself in a whisper.

<b>                               DELLA
</b>                  I'm sorry.

       All she knows is that she just killed a boy. It may have been
       in self defense but she killed him.

<b>                            DELLA (CONT'D)
</b>                  I'm so sorry!

       The grief overcomes her silently. Her face crumples. Her
       stomach muscles spasm and wrack through her body. A grief so
       deep tears would be a relief.

<b>                            DELLA (CONT'D)
</b>                  Where are you, God?

       She falls to her knees in the stream. Holding herself and
       rocking. The freezing water seeps up into her clothes, her
       hair.

                 babies again.

       Her rocking slows until it stops. There's a loud crunch close
       by. She rises reflexively from the stream. Raises the
       toolbox. She looks around. A branch has broken from a tree
       and drags down into the stream behind her.

       This seems to bring her back to herself. She realizes it's
       only a matter of time before they come looking for her. She
       needs to get moving.

       She sets off downstream. She trudges through the shallow
       water. Her wet coat drags heavily.

       The stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge of
       the woods.

       She trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stooping
       trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream.

       Forging ahead.

       She now needs to pee. GREAT. Her temper surges up.

       She looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's
       probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it will
       be dispersed.

       A leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the
       stream. She makes her way toward it.

       She lays the toolbox down and disappears between the
       branches. We see glimpses of her lifting her coat, pulling
       down her pants, pushing the crotch of her underpants to the
       side. We hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water
       meeting the stream.

       More glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants,
       smoothing down her coat.

       She hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up
       the toolbox.

       She plows down stream once more. Longing to see the light
       that will tell her she's at the edge of the woods, closer to
       the mall lights, closer to home.

       She swallows another wave of grief.

       The stream loops around ahead then splits into two. She
       follows it, picks the left fork.

       And then she hears it, the terrible sound of feet thundering
       down into the stream behind her.

       She doesn't even turn to see them. Just runs. Runs for her
       life.

       The glare of the flashlight blasts against her back. Freezing
       water splashes up her legs, soaking through her pants. Her
       feet slip and slide over wet rocks. But she keeps running.

       Vinh's behind her. She can feel his breath, the swipe of his
       hands as he grabs for her and misses. She runs even faster.

       She leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream. They leap
       behind her.

       She pushes through the hanging branches of several trees.
       Pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes,
       right into Vinh's face.

       He tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes. He cries
       out, covers his eyes.

<b>                             VINH
</b>                 Aaaarrhh.

       This buys her a moment or two to get ahead. The stream bends
       right ahead. She opts to stay in it. Chuckie leaps out, runs
       along the banks, hoping to outrun and trap her.

       But the stream then bends left, giving her an advantage. He
       leaps back across the stream to the other side. But she's
       outrunning him. He charges back into the stream behind her.

       Della keeps on running through the stream, somehow trusting
       its direction.

       Vinh catches up with Chuckie. The boys are maybe twenty-five
       feet behind her.

       A SHOT rings out. Then a bullet races past her ear. Lodges in
       a tree just ahead of her. She almost loses her footing. She'd
       forgotten for just a moment, that they had a gun.

       Another shot blasts off into the night, skims her shoulder,
       hits the muddy bank of the stream. She flinches, braces
       herself, keeps going, adrenalin pumping harder than ever.

</b>

       The stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead. For just a
       moment she's invisible to them. She uses it. When she reaches
       the rocks, she dives out, ducking below the glare of
       Chuckie's flashlight, down behind the rocks.

       She creeps up the muddy embankment hiding deep in the shadows
       of some wiry shrubs, as close to the mud as her back will
       allow.

       The boys stop by the rocks. Chuckie sweeps the flashlight up
       the muddy embankment, looking for a footprint, a sign of her.

       She tries to creep through the midst of the brush to avoid
       leaving prints. Tries to stay quiet as a mouse. Stops when
       she sees the flashlight sweep by.

       If she can get to the top, she can make another run for it.

       All of a sudden, it grows dark. The boys must have switched
       the flashlight off or maybe the battery's dead. She listens
       hard for their footfalls. Nothing.

       She sees that she is in the shadows of a big old Pine tree.

       She creeps behind its massive gnarled trunk and silently
       slides open the toolbox, fumbles around for the screwdriver.
       She removes it from the box and grasps it tight.

       Della rises slowly, remaining concealed behind the tree. She
       reaches up and softly places the toolbox deep in the junction
       of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk. She pulls
       herself up onto the branch and edges in close to the trunk.
       She peeks between the branches.

       No sign of the boys. She pulls herself further up into the
       tree, branch by branch.

       The thin stiff outer branches, fringed with sharp little
       needles, fall like a jagged veil around her.

       She waits.

       She's high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape
       below despite the darkness.

       She makes out the faint echo of voices, strains to hear.

       Chuckie clicks the flashlight back on. Sweeps it up, across
       and back down the embankment to the stream, illuminating the
       banks.

       Vinh pushes through several trees, slips, regains his
       footing. He plods past the tree. She slips the screwdriver up
       her sleeve. Prays he won't stop.

       She pulls herself further up the tree.

       A sudden commotion of swaying branches startles her, followed
       by a shower of pine needles.

       A moment later the sound of fluttering wings is followed by
       the squawking of angry birds.

       She sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst
       through the branches above and up into the patch of sky
       between.

       The crows circle the patch of sky above, like a Greek chorus.

       She looks back down for a sign of Vingh. Sees nothing. Inches
       along a branch to see better.

       The light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye
       line, disorienting her.

       She hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree.

       Her eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him: Vinh
       standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her.
       She stares down at him, frozen, holding her breath.

       The flashlight illuminates the whole tree, then sweeps away
       up the embankment.

       But Vinh's seen something. He makes out her footprints under
       the tree. He leans down to check, then rises, looks up
       through the branches.

       Their eyes meet. He opens his mouth to shout for Chuckie.

       She LEAPS down through the branches. Lands THUD on his back.

       She drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her
       knuckles dig into his stiff hair.

       Vinh's scream becomes a high keening wail.

       The screwdriver pierces the base of Vinh's skull. It
       protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out in a
       stream of blood.

       His scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins.

       They roll downstream.

       His arms are wrapped in a death grip around her.

       They roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds
       of the way down.

       She feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. He
       becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies
       right there on top of her.

       She's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she finds
       the strength to push him off.

       She crawls out from under his body.

       Pushing him away, sets him off rolling again.

         She tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. Her head
       hurts so bad it's about to burst.

       The world around her shifts into a migraine zone. Trails
       follow trees, rocks, brush. The desire to close her eyes, to
       close it all out almost overwhelms her.

       Her shoulder aches too and there's a new pain in her arm
       where Vinh bit her. She sees blood has matted her sleeve, and
       rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark.

       There's a loud crash. Della freezes and moves only her eyes,
       looks around.

       It's Vinh's body hitting the stream below.

       Where was the light at the edge of the woods? Nowhere to be
       seen now that's for sure.

       She staggers along the slope, clutching onto tree trunks and
       roots as she goes.

       Della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy
       slope. Pulls it clean out by the roots. Loses her footing,
       reaches for the roots of an old tree. She pulls herself up.

       Plods once more along the slope, heading upwards in a
       diagonal through the darkness.

       She arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more
       darkness. But there's a strange calm about her now. Like
       she's reached the eye of a terrible storm.

       When she hears his voice drifting faintly towards her, she
       almost smiles.

       She knows he's coming for her and there's nothing she can do
       about it.

       Della shivers as she sees a surreal tableau ahead: four huge
       felled trees wrapped in white plastic. Their sad stumps are
       only feet away. It's the funeral parlour of the forest.

       Della sinks down behind the large trunk of a plastic wrapped
       tree. She listens hard, tries to fathom which direction he's
       coming from.

       His voice drifts in and out of proximity like he's pacing
       around in circles. His voice has changed - he's dropped the
       gangster schtick.

<b>                            CHUCKIE
</b>                  There's only you and me, now.

       Maybe, if he wanders into the right position, she can sneak
       up on him from behind. She rakes about in the dirt looking
       for a rock or a stick. Then she remembers something, sticks
       her hand in her pocket, half smiles.

</b>                 I saw a little trail of your blood
                 back there. You must be hurt.

       Della checks out the bite mark on her arm to find it's still
       bleeding.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
</b>                 I'm hurting too. I think you busted
                 up my collarbone.

       His black silhouette appears ahead between the gray trees.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

</b>                 I can smell your blood, your sweat.

       She doesn't move.

       She watches him pace around trying to work out where she is.

       He pulls out a pack of cigarettes, taps one out, lights it.
       Inhales. Exhales.

       He laughs admiringly.

       The tone of his voice begins to change.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
</b>                 And that's hot, hell yeah.

       Frustration breaks through his voice. She can see his shadowy
       form moving through the darkness towards her. He stops.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
</b>                 And they're really cute.

       Chuckie clicks on the flashlight, shines it straight ahead -
       right in between the plastic wrapped trees.

       Della freezes.   They?

       Chuckie's eyes penetrate the darkness.

<b>                              CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
</b>                 Twins huh?     Terri and Tammi.

       Della doesn't move. Terrified.

</b>                 I bet you could use that cigarette

                 A woman's purse can tell her whole
                 life story!

       Della stares petrified as he unfolds her purse from deep in
       his jacket. He empties the contents out onto the dirt.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

                 and say hello.

       Della wants to run at him so bad she almost hyperventilates.
       But she also knows that's what he wants and she refuses to
       give him the satisfaction.

       We move in closer on Chuckie. He's looking right at where
       she's hiding, pure malevolence hardening his face to a mask.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

       We move in on Della. Her knuckles are blue white and her eyes
       are blazing. Rage explodes in her. She doesn't even realize
       that she is shouting till she's done.

<b>                           DELLA
</b><b>                 I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

       Chuckie waltzes towards her hiding place.

<b>                           CHUCKIE
</b>                 I figured that would help you find
                 your voice!

       Della crouches further in behind the felled trees. Why the
       hell did she shout? She could have been hiding anywhere. Now
       he must know for sure where she is.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

                 Right, Della?

       She clamps her mouth closed. Chuckie continues waltzing
       toward her, stops about twelve feet away. He stares in
       between the felled trees like he has x-ray vision.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)

</b>                 You won!

       Sadness creeps into his voice.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
</b>                 You took him from me...He was only
                 seventeen years old. And all he
                 ever wanted to do was see the
                 ocean. And he never saw it. No, he
                 never got to go.

       Chuckie's grief sits like a stone in his throat.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
</b>                 They're all gone now.

       Chuckie coughs, a dry laboured cough. He hocks long and
       deeply in his throat. But whatever it is he can't spit it
       out. He rubs his throat and collarbone gingerly.

       Della looks puzzled.   Yeah, and?

       This can't be real. Has he lost his mind? She utters under
       her breath.

       Chuckie reaches down, retrieves her diary from the dirt. She
       cringes.

       He sounds deadly serious, seductive even. She's lost in some
       kind of trance, looking like she just might believe him.

       Can she possibly be believing this?

       But she doesn't finish the sentence. She rises slowly from
       between the plastic wrapped trees.

       A momentary grimace of pain crosses her face. Then, their
       eyes meet, like for the first time. It catches them both by
       surprise. He smiles.

       Della steps around the plastic wrapped trees and between the
       stumps. She heads towards him, slowly, deliberately.

       Chuckie's hands are by his sides. She stops a few feet away
       from him.

       She can see him up close. The clearest view of him yet. They
       both look like they've been to hell.

<b>                           CHUCKIE

       He lays the flashlight on the ground and turns the lens to
       point up through the trees and into the sky between them.

       They stare at one another, all alone in the night. A knowing
       moment stretches between them.

       collarbone.

       He glances to the side for a split second, turns the gun as
       he turns his head. It's enough. Della slips the flare out of
       her pocket and opens it in his face.

       Before he even has time to react she LEAPS at him with all
       the spring left in her legs. Her fingers close around the
       wrist with the gun.

       The flare falls aside casting its fiery glow across them.

       She crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his
       collar bone is broken. It makes the ugly noise of sinew
       tearing.

       She tumbles him down to the December ground and wraps her
       legs tight around him. Tight like a lover.

       She grinds her chin deep and forcefully into the area of his
       broken collarbone, exacerbating the wound.

       He cries out, thrashes about. She keeps her body melded to
       his, grinding her chin even deeper.

       He wraps his arms tightly around her and pulls her even
       closer, wrenches her chin up and away from his collarbone.

       They roll across the dirt.   He whispers, low and close to
       her.

<b>                           CHUCKIE (CONT'D)
</b>                 You're even better than I thought.

       He pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin
       returning to the wound. She tries to pull away but he only
       presses harder.

       Neither can break away.

       It's unclear who's got the gun.

       They roll until she suddenly pulls away, sits up.

       But he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock.

       And she has the gun.

       They look at each other. He smiles.

       He makes for the gun.

       She fires into his chest, just once, it's enough.

       His legs release. He slumps back.   Blood darkens his shirt.

       Gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound. Blood seeps
       below him from the exit wound, spreading out in a dark
       puddle.

       His body surrenders to death.

       She stares down at him. A queasy silent moment passes. She
       stares at the gun in her hands. It feels so heavy, so unreal.

       His dead eyes stare. She reaches over and closes them gently.

       And she's light-headed, so light-headed she could just float
       away. Somehow she stands up.

       She looks back down at the body, not quite believing he could
       be dead. She sees her silver locket lying beside him in the
       pool of blood.

       She retrieves it. Uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from
       its exterior. Inside the photos of her kids are still there;
       tiny photos of Tammis little thoughtful face and Terri's
       mischievous one look back at her. She snaps the locket
       closed.

       She searches the area for the rest of her belongings, finds
       her wallet, her purse, her diary, her lighter, her tampax
       box, a lipstick in the dirt. She sticks everything in her
       purse. She almost misses her pack of cigarettes. We see them
       half buried under the dirt. She scans the area once more
       finds them. The pack is empty but she takes it anyway.

       It's time to go home.

       A moment of trepidation as she reaches her car. What if it's

       nothing good could ever possibly happen to her again.

       The hood is still ajar by a few inches, the weight of pine
       branches still pressing upon it. She uses the last of her
       strength to try push them away. A few smaller branches give
       way but the bigger one won't budge.

       She reaches under the hood for the bar and pulls hard. It
       scrapes along the inner surface of the hood as she forces it
       to prop the hood open to its maximum, about fifteen inches.
       The hood buckles but there's enough room for her to reach in.

       She fumbles about and finds the positive wire has come loose
       from its attachment to the battery. She re-attaches the wire
       and, Presto, the car lights up and the keys start to ping.

       She almost smiles as she forces the bar back down. The hood
       slams down after it.

       Gosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. She

       passes the familiar sign for "Pleasant Valley Drive". The

       a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. She decides to

       She sighs, closes her eyes with relief, softly closes the
       door behind her.

       Kenneth is pacing about the kitchen, opening another beer.

</b>                 Sound asleep, huh?

       Kenneth, unsure what to do, tries to make a joke.

       He shrinks back, silent for once, blind panic playing across
       his face.

       But not hers. She's cold, cold as the icy night.

       She pulls the trigger at point blank range. CLICK

       He recoils.

       But no bullet disengages from the barrel. Nothing. She knew
       there were no bullets left.

       But the click echoes throughout the silent house.
