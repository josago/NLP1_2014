</b><b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN
</b>CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW
MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin
Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after
her but UNSEEN.
She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,
her BREATHING becoming more labored.
Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves.
Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her
racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.

<b>DREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOOR
</b>and safety loom half a block down. She pours on the
effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the
door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.

<b>ANGLE ON THE SHRUB
</b>where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN
RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT
HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Drew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an ASTHMA INHALER
from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window
in the front door and sees...

<b>DREW'S POV
</b>The puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to
extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs
it close:
<b>                           SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL
</b>             Where are you going, Jelly Bean?
<b>                                                CUT TO:
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                      2.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING
CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly)
which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW
<b>WAGGING.
</b>From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD,
17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the
shrieking ALARM CLOCK.
With a SIGH, she throws her feet  over the edge of the
bed. Her room is a train wreck.    Grabbing a MatchBox 20
T-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff.
Good enough. Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit
concerned down at her navel.
A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She
touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins
tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the
source.
She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:
<b>THOREAU 786:   MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M.
</b>Parker snickers, types her return from...
<b>NOTATWIN:   CONFESS
</b><b>THOREAU 786:   DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER.
</b><b>NOTATWIN:   THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH.
</b><b>THOREAU 786: THEN BOUGHT 'NO MONEY DOWN' REAL ESTATE
</b><b>COURSE AROUND 3:00 A.M.
</b>This makes her smile.
<b>NOTATWIN:   A CAREER MAN.   I LIKE THAT.
</b><b>                                            CUT TO:

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In
a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...
... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little
labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath
where it says, "tweezers."
She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray
eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her
other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even.

</b><b>                                                         3.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow.
Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and
keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She
reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches
herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too
psychotic.
She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces
them.
Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit.       Grabbing her
WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.
<b>                           PARKER (O.S.)
</b>             Morning.
Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water
pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off
the water pick, dries her face.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             Why the young executive look?
<b>                           DREW
</b>             I have my interview at NYU today.
Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new
belly ring.
<b>                           DREW
</b>             No way Mom knows about that.
Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt
down.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             And she never will. At least
             until after I'm married.
<b>                           DREW
</b>             Didn't it hurt?
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             Like hell.
Drew shivers.
<b>                           DREW
</b>             Piercings are so... unhygienic.
A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off.

</b>             Breakfast.
Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her
Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of...
... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post-
apocalyptic toiletry    landscape. There's a very clear
line of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized
zone separating the    Koreas.
Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but
notices another message on her Blackberry:
<b>THOREAU 786:     KNOW WHAT TODAY IS?
</b><b>NOTATWIN:     ANOTHER DAY IN HELL?
</b><b>THOREAU 786:     TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT.
</b><b>NOTATWIN:     OUR ANNIVERSARY.    HOW SWEET.
</b><b>THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REAL
</b><b>NAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'D
</b><b>LOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO.
</b>Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes
downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein
model-type.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>                     (suddenly wide-awake)
             Hellooo, Warren.
Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces
off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet.
ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking.
Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of
the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered
holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then...
nah.
Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth,
brushes with a finger and spits.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying
her open DAYBOOK.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>DR. QUINN MacLEOD, dressed professionally and obviously
together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and
her husband, PROFESSOR CHARLEY MacLEOD, who ENTERS still
in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head.
As a matter of routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he
takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.
<b>                             DREW
</b>             Morning, Dad.
<b>                             CHARLEY
</b>             Morning, baby.
<b>                           DREW
</b>             How's the book coming?
<b>                            CHARLEY
</b>                     (sigh)
             Well, sweety, my writing process
             is a lot like a giant
             hydroelectric dam. For a long
             time I just let the great ideas
             build up and build up until the
             sheer weight of them spills over
             and the words just come pouring
             out.
<b>                           DREW
</b>             Still stuck, huh?
<b>                             CHARLEY
</b>             Not a word.
Parker ENTERS with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her
pop, then takes a sat.
Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour
milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super
Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both
hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar.
Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat
toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like
Drew.
Drew spots the BLACKBERRY JPEG of Warren before Parker
can turn it over.
<b>                           DREW

</b>                     (funny you
                      should ask)
             I've prepared a color-coded
             itinerary based on dividing the
             day into fifteen minute increments
             alternating blue/red, double-
             checked the train schedule,
             confirmed with the Weather Channel
             and rehearsed a couple of
             alternate scenarios last night,
             you know, just to account for all
             the possible glitches.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             We'll take that as a yes.
<b>                           CHARLEY
</b>             I'm proud of you for sticking to
             your plan all these years, sweety.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             I still don't understand why you
             want to finish college in two
             years? What's the big hurry?
<b>                           DREW
</b>             I want to hit the ground running.
             All those football games and the
             partying and the whole dating
             scene. It just seems like a lot
             of wasted time that could be spent
             more productively.
<b>                           QUINN
</b>             The Accelerated program would look
             great on your med school
             application.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             Football games I get. But
             partying? A waste of time?
Parker looks to her dad.     He shrugs.

Everybody stops what they're doing for a BEAT.
<b>                           QUINN
</b>             I took the day off.
                     (excitedly)

<b>                           DREW
</b>                     (panicked)
             What -- ?!
Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out
her nose.
<b>                           QUINN
</b>             Isn't that great! We can do some
             shopping, have lunch, real girl
             stuff. Won't that be fun?
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             If you want to have fun, I'm the
             one who should go, not Mother
             Teresa over there.
Drew is still choking -- pretty badly.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             Let me know if you want me to do
             the Heimlich. It'd be cool to
             have you owe me your life.
WHOOSH!   The granola goes down and she sucks air.

             I've got every minute accounted
             for right up to the interview.

             away to college next Fall.
She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker
follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             Don't be sad, Mom. Just think,
             when Drew leaves for school, you
             won't be losing a daughter, you'll
             be losing an anal-retentive social
             misfit who will be voted most
             likely to die a virgin.

The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go.
Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the
news that her mother's going to accompany her.

<b>INT. DREW'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite. Almost
trembling with tension, she ENTERS and immediately sits
down at her desk with her DAYPLANNER, turning to the
present DATE:
<b>CLOSE ON THE PAGE, WHERE EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS COLOR-

With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the
mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself
and tries some self-reassurance.
<b>                           DREW
</b>             You're smart. You're resourceful.
             You'll find a way to make it work.
She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but
something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED.
Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell
phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag.


EXT. DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING
Quinn hops in her Saab.
ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep
breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned
prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in.

checks the incoming number. Drew closes her eyes and
prays.

disappointment, turns to Drew.

Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.
<b>                        DREW
</b>          Ah, darn it, Mom. That's a shame.
          It's like fate is conspiring
          against us.

Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss.

Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her
mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street.
With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her
shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you."
This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in
her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course
her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street.
<b>                            DREW

collects her bag.
<b>                           PARKER

</b>             You know, Parker. Chemistry is

             numbers and stinky test tubes.
Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train
station. Parker SIGHS, looks to the BLACKBERRY on the
seat next to her.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             Ah, chemistry.

<b>INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING
</b>Drew finds a seat.     She neatly folds her jacket and sets
it next to her.
She pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind
her -- just right. Next, she takes out a tiny inflatable
lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. A pen
goes in the little holder. Coffee from her Thermos.
After laying out her interview materials, she turns to
her reflection in the window.

             afternoon. I'm Drew MacLeod.
An EXECUTIVE takes the aisle seat next to her, and after
a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his
Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away.
EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring
off into their own world, wondering why their life has
lead them to this sad moment when...
... they're all distracted by an AWFUL, AWFUL VOICE
singing Sheryl Crow's "Soak Up the Sun." It's Parker,
wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full
train car.
Drew stares at her, dumbfounded.

she pulls them off.

the old paternal reprimand look.

Cracker's "Follow Me," torturing everyone in her car.

</b>          'You don't know how you met me...'
But when she spots the CONDUCTOR ENTERING the front of

slides past the COMMUTER LADY next to her into the aisle.
<b>                        PARKER
</b>          Excuse me.
Parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket-
taking Conductor and out the back of the train car.

<b>INT. THE TRAIN - WOMEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>Parker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if
the coast is clear.
Sounds good. She cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes,
closes the door and THERE'S THE CONDUCTOR. He smiles.
<b>                        CONDUCTOR

          this one time because I know
          you've got a big heart and you
          remember what it was like when you
          were young and... and...
                  (off the Conductor's

Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little
inflatable lap desk falling to the floor.
<b>                        CONDUCTOR

             be in jail.
As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and
Dream Guy share a last look before she's...
... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out.
Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her
wits about her.

She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her
hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket
in the mess.
The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as
it pulls away. He just waves, victorious.
Parker    steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor
spots    her. He looks from one sister to the other --
oops,    mistake. But it's too late. Sheepishly, he climbs
inside    and the train is gone.

</b>Parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. She
scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded
COMMUTERS jostle for the few remaining TAXIS.
TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match.
To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS --
standard car service rigs -- sit IDLING, each with a
DRIVER next to it, holding up his sign with his client's
name scratched on it.
An EXECUTIVE (#2) passes her, finger in the air,
signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that read:
"Wilcox."
<b>                        EXECUTIVE #2
</b>          That's me.
With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for
him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his
side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind.
Parker raises an eyebrow.    Hm.
The second driver (BENNIE) with a head like a cinder
block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and
holding up a sign, "SCARPELLI."
Parker shoots a finger into the air. This barely gets
his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. Parker signals
again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.

Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only
got this instant to consider. She glances at the
STRANDED MOB descending on a lone approaching CAB,
engulfing it.

out, the same way they came.

They round the same corner going the opposite way and
Parker pulls them into the first door...

There's no real       lobby, just a small area to stand at the

rabbit-eared TV       with a busted-in tube houses a dead

             What it is, is quite possibly the
             most important day of my life.
             I've resigned myself to the fact
             that you don't give a crap about

             appreciate it.
But Parker's not listening.       She's staring intently...

the DRIVERS chatting next to a HOT DOG/PRETZEL CART.

and freezes.

quickly down the street.

out in the crowd? He nods to ANOTHER DRIVER, tosses his
coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.

</b>             Come on!
Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they
weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE
CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute,
Parker spots a fresh pile of...
... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew,
however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her
eyes.

Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow
manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT,
we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it.
Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and
puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits
in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass.
This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch
inside some revolving doors.

<b>                           DREW
</b>             Don't look.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>             When you ask a question like that,
             the person is going to look.
Drew drags her behind a palm. Sure enough, across the
lobby, a guy dressed as PLAINCLOTHES HOTEL SECURITY
(MORTY SESTERO) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on
them.
<b>                           DREW
</b>             I think he was.

</b>             Drew, we haven't done anything.
<b>                           DREW
</b>             Yeah, but I'm standing in the
             lobby of the Plaza looking like a
             deranged street person who might
             attack at any moment. In fact, I
             might attack at any moment.
The ELEVATOR behind them opens.

The girls slip into the elevator.     When it closes,
Morty's watching.

of the hall where Parker stops and peers back around the

</b>Parker leads her to the big double doors of the master
bedroom and slowly OPENS them.
There, on the bed, is THE EMPEROR, defending champion of
the New York Kennel Club Dog Show. A CHINESE CRESTED
HAIRLESS with his little crown sticking straight up, he
may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. He simply
eyes them. He might even be smiling.

             tough, huh? You don't look much
             like a dog, actually. More like

into Parker's arms.

But The Emperor, feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into
the hallway, then turns TO face her. Come on. Let's
play!

</b>          Come back here, little ratdog.
          Come to Mommy Parker.
Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to
keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to
spook him into running away from her, she steps into the
hallway.


<b>INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA
</b>But sure enough, just as she gets close, he turns and
dashes down the hallway.
<b>                           PARKER
</b>          Bad ratdog!
She chases him down the hallway     and then around the
corner where they have to dodge     cans of paints, a ladder,
until finally The Emperor slides     on some plastic
sheeting, careens into a can of     mauve paint and is
<b>COVERED.
</b>Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker looks up to see
the Painter (ROGER) with the now-mauve Emperor in his
arms.

</b>                 Thank you. Bye bye.
          No.
He turns and RUNS for the stairwell door marked
EXIT. Parker, completely baffled, finally calls after
him:

as he reaches for the handle, the door swings open,

there, also at a dead run and they don't even break

Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out.        They
hurry off down the alley.

running makeup and shower curtain and does a double-take.

The Showrunner shoves Drew one way, Parker the other --
Drew looks at her -- what the hell? Parker CLEARLY
MOUTHS: HAIR! MAKEUP! CLOTHES! and TEAMS OF DRESSERS

</b>And   the DRESSING TEAM surrounding Parker parts, revealing
her   in a very un-Parker-like, super-chic business suit.
She   catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls
her   eyes. Boring.
The DREW TEAM parts and    we are stunned to see they've
chosen to drape her in a    show-stopping couture FREAK SHOW
OUTFIT that is some sort    of marriage between dominatrix
and nun, complete with a    habit and black leather bikini.

the movie, speechless.

</b>FLASH go a hundred CAMERAS! Blinded, Drew stumbles
forward on a nine-inch spiked heels down the catwalk.

<b>INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE
</b>Parker's watching through the curtains when she spots
Morty leading two NYPD DETECTIVES (WILLIAMSON AND HOGAN)
through the back door. Uh-oh.
The Showrunner's holding her arm, waiting to throw her
onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker
takes the initiative and...


<b>INT. RUNWAY
</b>... jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she
was born to it.
Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the
APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in
her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and...
... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy
executive! and leans into her sister:

</b>                     (whispering)
             The hotel guy's here.
The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS
draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into
PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the
artist and they call him out! Bobo! BOBO! AUTEUR!
<b>BRAVA!
</b>Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing
kisses and heading for the girls.

</b>                     (louder)
             And the police.
Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their
hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot Morty
peeking from backstage, and they TAKE OFF, leaping off
the front of the stage into the audience like punks
jumping into the mosh pit.

</b>Spotting the commotion, he and the two cops race down the
catwalk. Realizing he'll never get through the crowd,
he, too, leaps off the stage to surf toward them but...
THE CROWD ABRUPTLY PARTS and he does a complete FACE

</b><b>                           HOGAN

Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they
have to pass by...
... the PLAZA MANAGER and the other HOUSE SECURITY AGENT,
BRUCE (butch haircut, bad suit), consoling Mrs. Lo
Biancho.
When MORTY and the COPS come through the doors behind
them, however, there's no choice.
The girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible
heading for the revolving doors but they overhear:

Bruce looks over to Morty like he's speaking Slavic, but
Morty's furiously pointing and Bruce sees...
THE GIRLS break for the revolving doors. Parker gets
there first, plunges in so fast that a MAN ENTERING is
tossed headlong into the lobby.
Drew tries to time the quickly-spinning door but one of
the very high SPIKED HEELS catches, throwing her forward
and sandwiching her in the revolving door.

door back, releasing Drew, who jumps in and swings out.

the regular    door just adjacent the revolving doors. All
four share    a sheepish look -- uh, maybe we should have
thought of    that -- then BOLT outside.

When the PHONE RINGS it nearly knocks him out of his

The Emperor and drops him into a gym bag.

Kennel Club Dog Show have begun filing into the Garden.
Ever wary, Roger carries The Emperor under one arm. The
Emperor pokes his nose out. Roger pushes it back in.

             Oh, the Professor and I have had a
             wonderful talk about how important
             this program is to me and how it
             was my sister, Drew, who screwed
             things up.

Seeing her plan to help Drew go awry, poor Parker's lip
trembles.

<b>                           PARKER
</b>             ... I didn't think you'd make it.
             I knew I wouldn't be any good at
             it, but I figured at least there
             was a chance.

             failed. I didn't follow the
             rules. And honestly, before
             today, I didn't know how I was
             going to live with that. How to
             live with failure. I'm not good
