               We see a LITTLE GIRL dancing around in a grainy super 8 home 
               movie. A LITTLE BOY wearing a monster MASK enters the frame. 
               He struggles to lift a double barrel shotgun. He points it 
               at the girl and pretends to SHOOT.

                         Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest 
                         little guy. Then one day he got sick 
                         and died. My heart was broken. My 
                         whole body hurt.

               She continues dancing. The little boy imitates her.

                         everything could be summed up with 
                         three simple words... fuck the world.

               The camera swings over to some ugly, toothless relations 
               watching the show. They laugh.

               We open on a dark, lonely stretch of two lane blacktop.

               Off to the side of the road we see a rundown gas station.

               A weathered wooden sign proclaims CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S WORLD

               A smaller sign below reads FRIED CHICKEN AND GASOLINE.

               Inside is a poorman's Ripley's Believe It or Not.

               Bizarre props and treasures of killers and monsters cover 
               the dirty walls. Wax figures of JACK THE RIPPER stand guard 
               before oil paintings by JOHN WAYNE GACY.

                         music marathon with this classic 
                         called The Teddy Bear's Picnic.

               Perched on a stool behind the counter sits CAPTAIN SPAULDING, 
               a crusty looking old man in a filthy clown suit and smeared 
               make-up. The word LOVE is tattooed across his right knuckles 
               and HATE is tattooed across the left.

               He is reading the newspaper, crunching on crackers from a 
               paper bag and halfheartedly listening to a small, nerdy man 
               wearing coke bottle glasses named STUCKY.

               Stucky thumbs through a stack of autographed 8x10 photographs.

               From Ravelli's POV we watch through the window, as everybody 
               inside starts SHOUTING at each other.

               Suddenly, Rich SHOOTS Stucky. Stucky FALLS BACKWARDS against 
               the wall, screaming in pain.

               We move QUICKLY towards the entrance.

               Suddenly... CRASH! Ravelli SMASHES through the front door 
               knocking Karl to the ground. In the light we see that Ravelli 
               is wearing an OVERSIZED CLOWN HEAD. In his hand is a 
               sledgehammer.

               Rich TURNS toward the COMMOTION. The Captain quickly WHIPS 
               OUT a GUN and FIRES. Rich falls dead.

               Ravelli lunges at Karl, smashing him over the head with the 
               hammer. Ravelli's clown head comes loose and falls to the 
               floor. We now see that Ravelli is a bald pitbull of a man 
               with badly scarred skin that is painted white and red.

               Karl hits the floor and begins CONVULSING violently.

               Spaulding STEPS DOWN from behind the counter, puts his foot 
               on Karl's throat and points his pistol at Karl's head.

               Sitting dead center in the middle of the road is a HUMONGOUS

               CRUCIFIED on crosses lining the drive. Everything is severely 
               overgrown.

               Bill and Baby enter the gates of the FARM, they walk up the 
               main drive.

               Baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud 
               puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house.

               The front of the house is covered with strange junk art. 
               Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls.

               In a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny 
               hovering over a BED containing the hunched, fragile old body 
               of GRAMPA.

               Grampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over 
               the edge of the bed. Tiny helps him to stand.

                         sister start counting out my money 
                         yet.

               Grampa steadies himself against Tiny. They slowly walk out 
               of the room.

</b>                         God damn, my dogs are barking.

               As they move into the light of the hallway, it is clear that 
               Grampa is in his late 80's.

               Grampa quickly grows tired. Tiny picks him up in his arms 
               and carries him down the stairs to the dining room.

               As they move past, the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE 
               OBJECT sitting on a shelf.

               A LARGE GLASS JAR containing a DEFORMED BABY. The pickled 
               punk looks to have a small second head growing from its 
               temple. The label on the jar reads STUFFY 1973.

               The sound from the TV fades up in the background.

               BELA LUGOSI'S VOICE can be heard.

               He reaches over and picks up a small alarm clock, notices 
               the time, concerned look comes over his face.

               The phone rings. He quickly answers it.

               A PALE FIGURE creeps forward like NOSFERATU from a dark corner 
               of the room. This is OTIS.

               He stands six foot, but is deathly slim. His skin is 
               translucent, glowing in the dark. Long thin white hair covers 
               his head. His eyes are grey. He is an ALBINO.

               He is holding a GLASS JAR containing a SMALL FETUS. On closer 
               inspection we see there are two small bodies joined to one 
               head. The label reads WOLF.

               assortment of chairs face a large quilted curtain. Filling 
               these seats are LIFELESS DUMMIES.

               Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise take their seats.

               Mary flips open the program. Inside, written in crayon, are 
               the words: HALLOWEEN EXTRAVAGANZA -- starring the Comedy

               The sound of a warped crackling record fills the room. Lounge 
               music.

               A small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage. 
               Mother Firefly stands behind the controls.

               She is smiling proudly.

               The curtain clumsily parts TO REVEAL:

               A stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage.

               A giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage, surrounded 
               by dancing skeletons and demon girls.

               A microphone stands center stage.

               The sound of CANNED APPLAUSE fills the room. Bill begins to 
               applaud, Jerry and Denise join in. Mary does not.

               Grampa walks out to center stage, mic in hand and begins to 
               speak.

               The kids stare in shock at Grampa. Jerry begins to laugh.

               The recorded crowd screams with laughter, as does Jerry.  
               Bill, Denise and Mary look at him like he's crazy.

               The stage lights come up. The recorded applause and music 
               begin.

               Baby enters the stage. She is dressed in a home-made showgirl 
               outfit. She begins to dance clumsily to the music. She appears 
               to be somewhat intoxicated.

               The vocals come on and Baby begins to lipsync to the song.

                         disturbing your viewing pleasure?

               Baby makes her way down from stage on to floor level. She 
               gyrates and seductively TEASES one of the dummy audience 
               members.

               Baby moves over to Jerry. Stroking her hand down his face. 
               Denise tries to look amused. Jerry smiles uncomfortably.

               Baby strolls past Denise and stops in front of Mary.

               Baby pauses and pinches Mary's cheek and winks. Mary is 
<b>               FURIOUS.

               Baby moves over to Bill. Mary watches like a mother hawk.

               Baby sings and dances with all of her attention focused on 
               Bill.

               Baby puts her arms around Bill's neck and sits on his lap. 
               Mary BOLTS FORWARD and SHOVES Baby off of Bill.

               Baby crashes onto the floor.

               Bill pulls the car up to the front gate. It is chained shut 
               with a huge padlock.

               LIGHTNING CRASHES, illuminating the crucified scarecrows.

               Jerry, Mary and Denise watch through the windshield as Bill 
               struggles to unlatch the thick iron gates.

               SUDDENLY, one of the SCARECROWS JUMPS down from his cross 
               and SMASHES Bill over the head with a HEAVY CLUB. Bill drops

               Bill lays motionless, face down in the mud. His attacker

               Mary opens her eyes, squinting into the light. Sunlight peers 
               through filth on the windows, fractured by the tattered 
               remains of rotted curtains. Peeling yellowed newspaper serves 
               as wallpaper surrounding the window.

               Mary's eyes move across the walls to a painting of a BIG 
               EYED KITTEN. She stares at it and smiles. A look of horror 
               begins to appear on her face. She begins to scream 
               uncontrollably.

               ZOOM BACK to see Mary wearing a dunce cap, tied to a chair, 
               facing a corner in the farmhouse's attic. This is Otis's art 
               studio.

               Otis, standing before a large canvas, sets down his paint 
               brush and calmly walks over to Mary.

               He spins her chair around, clamps her mouth shut with his 
               hand and leans his nose against hers.

               The door swings open. Wydell enters slowly, putting on his 
               best cowboy attitude. Naish follows suit.

               Wydell, hands on his belt, struts up to the counter.

               No one is around.

               A rusted bell sits on the counter, taped to it is a 
               handwritten note, "ring for service". Wydell rings it once, 
               waits, no response. Rings it again, waits, no response.

               We move around the car to see the nude body of Karen Murphy 
               laying in the trunk. Her arms and legs are hog tied. She is 
               dead. The word TRICK is carved into her side.

<b>               INT. FARMHOUSE BASEMENT - TINY'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Water drips down from the leaking pipes above. Scavenging 
               rats scurry across the concrete floor.

               In a far corner a single light burns, a child's Humpty Dumpty 
               lamp, illuminating --

               Denise is strapped to an old wooden bed. She has been stripped 
               of her own clothes and is now wearing a blue checked little 
               girl's dress. Her hair is tied in pigtails.

               She is cold and shivering.

               BOOM. The basement door opens, heavy footsteps lumber down 
               the creaking stairs. It is Tiny.

               Tiny is wearing an orange T-shirt that reads, "This is my 
               Halloween costume". For the first time we see the skin on 
               his arms, it is severely deformed from burn scars.

               He is holding a small tray. On the tray is a box of cereal, 
               milk, a bowl and a spoon.

               Tiny goes over to Denise, sets down the tray, and proudly 
               displays his T-shirt.

                         Please... Tiny, please. Let me go... 
                         help me.

               Tiny sits down on a stool next to the bed, he stares down at 
               Denise like a confused dog.

                         Please, God please.

               Tiny begins preparing her food, carefully pouring the cereal 
               and milk into the bowl. He stirs it with the spoon.

               Tiny gently lifts Denise's head and feeds her like a baby. 
               Denise swallows the food, trying not to choke. After a few 
               spoonfuls Tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of 
               the room.

               He pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light. In 
               the light we see a rusty cage, inside are three rail-thin 
               female bodies.

               Tiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage.

               One of the bodies moves to eat the scraps, the others do 
               not. They are dead.

               Tiny turns off the overhead light.

               Wydell's cruiser turns up the road to the Firefly farmhouse.

               Dirty dishes overflow from the rusty metal sink onto the

               left to rot on a table. Boxes of trash and old newspapers 
               are stacked to the ceiling.

               Music from a crackling radio is heard.

               Mother stands stirring a large pot on the stove. A LOUD 
               knocking interrupts her cooking. She sets down her spoon and 
               walks to the front door.

               Before opening the door she peeks through the curtains of a

               Naish sees Willis fall. Before he can react a voice calls 
               out from behind him.

               style. A white puff of smoke comes from Otis's gun and a 
               distant popping sound is heard. Naish falls over on his side.

               The house stands silent in the darkness. Lightning crashes, 
               a heavy rain falls.

               Burning JACK-O'-LANTERNS beam from every window. Smoke rises 
               from the chimney.

               The movie begins and we move off the TV to see:

               Hundreds of CANDLES are lit, illuminating everything with a 
               flickering light. Music blares from a cheap stereo. BLACK 
               and ORANGE PAPER STREAMERS are draped from ceiling to floor.

               Dead center is a LARGE OBJECT standing seven feet tall, it 
               is completely covered in paper Halloween decorations. A long 
               chain connects the object up into the rafters.

               This is the Halloween party from Hell.

               An intoxicated Grampa, dressed as FLASH GORDON, sits in his 
               wheelchair watching the TV, drinking MOONSHINE from an 
               unmarked bottle.

               CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! Tiny stands in a corner tunelessly 
               banging on a large oil drum. He is dressed like a low budget 
               BATMAN, in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape.

               A drunk Rufus, wearing a bloody police uniform, stands on a 
               table SHOUTING along to the music through a POLICE MEGAPHONE.

               Mother and Baby, both dressed as SUPERHEROES, dance around 
               the covered object. Both are swigging moonshine from jugs.

               Mother and Baby start TEARING AWAY the paper covering from 
               the object in the middle of the room. They RIP at the paper, 
               spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual.

               As the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see: 
               Denise, Jerry and Mary tied back to back hanging from the 
               chain, each are dressed in a different animal costume. Denise 
               is a pig, Jerry is a donkey and Mary is a rabbit. They are 
               gagged.

               Mother and Baby laugh at their helpless victims, splashing 
               moonshine in their faces.

               A robed figure, Otis, appears at the top of the stairs, he 
               begins to descend.

               Rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs. As Otis reaches the

               He drops his robe, underneath he is wearing a SUIT OF SKIN 
               sewn together from pieces of Denise's father.

               Denise stares in horror, tears stream down her cheeks, barely 
               able to comprehend the madness around her.

               Otis moves in close and licks her across the face.

               gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night.

               Otis, lantern in hand, leads the way. Followed by Baby and 
               Mother together under a large black umbrella. Next Rufus 
               holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary.

               Bringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners, 
               and Grampa. Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child. 
               He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam.

               The group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure.

                         Hold this. Point it over here.

               Baby directs the light at Otis. We see that he is trying to 
               unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in 
               the base of the wooden structure.

               Otis unlocks the door and swings it open. He reaches down 
               into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench, 
               attached to the hook is a chain.

               Otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit 
               to reveal a rusty metal crank. He begins to turn the crank. 
               Slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the 
               end of the chain.

               Otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground. 
               He flips open the lid.

               Denise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus. Rufus tries

               Baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field 
               after Mary.

               Mary trips and falls over a small gravestone. She gets up 
               and stumbles back into a wooden cross. She tears the gag

               lid shut. Through a CROSS-SHAPED OPENING in the coffin we 
               see them crushed together.

               Rufus LOWERS the coffin into the pit. Once the coffin is 
               inside Otis slams the door shut.

               Otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern

               decay hangs heavy in the thin air.

               Denise and Jerry, cold and shivering, hang half submerged in 
               thick maggot infested sludge. Bits of animal and human 
               skeletons float in the muck, broken bones lay in piles along

               to violently shake. Denise screams.

               Another reaches through, grabbing her feet. SMASH! The coffin 
               is ripped apart and Jerry is pulled away from the destruction.

               TWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a 
               shadowy object. Denise gasps. They turn towards Denise, 
               revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry.

               The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood, 
               they stare at Denise, then return to their prey.

               Denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist 
               in the underground maze. She turns the corner and runs 
               straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS. The ghouls are of 
               the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked, 
               cracking skin. Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness.

               They reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run

               Denise, waist high in sludge, wanders lost through the endless 
               tunnels of the pit. In the distance she hears high pitched 
               animal sounds.

               A GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise. It stands 
               silent. It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long curled 
               fingernails and grabs her hair. Denise screams and tries to 
               pull away. The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls 
               her closer, CLAWING at her face.

               Denise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls 
               backwards, slipping under the sludge. She quickly resurfaces 
               and starts to run.

               A beaten Denise struggles down a long tunnel. She gets to 
               the end to find that it is a dead-end. Behind her, FIVE GHOULS 
               move silently towards her, blocking her only exit.

               The ghouls slosh through the muck, moving in closer. Denise 
               frantically looks for an escape, nailed into the wall next 
               to her are planks of wood forming a ladder.

               The ghouls are only a few yards away. Denise climbs up the 
               ladder. They move in, clawing at her legs and feet, trying 
               to pull her down. Denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling 
               above her, trying to break free.

               Denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being 
               torn from her legs. She digs wildly at the ceiling, suddenly 
               a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal:

               STARS, the sky above shines through the hole. Denise smashes 
               her fists at the rotted wood planks, pulling free another 
               piece.

               With all her might Denise grabs hold and pulls herself up 
               through the opening.

               Denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body 
               up into the night air. The cool air rushes to her lungs. She 
               crawls free of the hole, gasping for air.

               She is safe. Suddenly... SMASH! A ghoul has broken through 
               the surface. He grabs Denise by the leg and begins to pull 
               her back into the hole.

               Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul. 
               She breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach.

               Rufus and Baby have pulled the police cruiser up by the stake. 
               Rufus and Baby stand on the hood.

               Otis finishes his sermon, he raises his arm. Tiny raises the 
               torch. Otis drops his arm, signaling Tiny. Tiny throws the 
               torch onto the stake. The stake ignites into a huge FIREBALL.

               Denise pulls herself to her feet and begins to run.

               The flaming object burns in the distance behind her.

               Denise stumbles toward the road on two badly injured legs.

               Rufus, Tiny and Baby jump up and down in celebration, smashing 
               the police car. Otis stands transfixed by the flames before 
               him.

               Denise makes her way out onto the road. No cars are in sight. 
               In the distance headlights break through the darkness. Denise 
               stands in the middle of the road.

               The TRUCK comes into view, it is a small cube truck.

               Denise stands in the headlights, waving her arms for it to 
               stop. The truck comes to a halt.

               She runs toward the passenger's side door and climbs in.

               Behind the wheel of the truck is Captain Spaulding.

               Denise is shaking from shock.

                         that live just up this road.

               Starts to turn the truck up the road back towards the 
               farmhouse.

                         ...I gotta get out, I gotta get out!

               Boom! The metal door leading to the back of the truck slides 
               open. Ravelli grabs Denise and pulls her back into the back 
               of the truck.

               SLAM! The metal door shuts.

               The truck quietly turns onto the dirt road leading up to the 
               farmhouse. The jack-o'-lanterns still burn in the windows, 
               grinning their evil grin.
