<b>          OUTSKIRTS OF A SOUTH TEXAS RAILROAD YARD (SAN RAFAEL)
</b>
<b>          A TRAIN ROARS PAST REVEALING IN THE DISTANCE FIVE MET RIDING
</b>          TOWARD CAMERA along the tracks. In CLOSE F.G. is.the back
          part of a sign.

<b>          NARRATOR
</b>          To most of America in 1913, the Age
          of Innocence had arrived and the
          stories of the Indian Wars and the
          Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters
          had become either barroom ballyhoo
          or front-porch remiraiscences... .But
          on both sides of the $io Grande men
           still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's
          and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a
          changing land.
          THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY..
          The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are
          regulation.
          PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead
          of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain...
          Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early
          forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant
          for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes
          in himself and those around him.
          Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are
          not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a
          killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for
          trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside
          and against society because he believes in that way of life
          and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of
          regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man'
          according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad,
          and he wouldn't have it any other way.
          Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant.
          Dutch is bigâ€ž good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong
          loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and
          regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm,
          but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one.
          Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH,
          dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot
          tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and

</b>          sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal,
          vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing
          for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go.
          They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each
          other and that is limited.
          A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL.
          Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle
          20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty
          under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with
          Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them
          all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent
          dignity of. man (some men at least). " He is faster than his
          companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't.
          laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride --
          Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,.
          he will have no regrets.
          REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP. Witut.speaking they, begin
          to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order.

          Riding downethe street they pass:

          W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass
          drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on
          inside.

          an ancient woman pays no attention as she slaps tortillas
          into shape. Two small children watch, big-eyed.

          near an adobe wall and drops them on a poncho, watches as
          the others do the same.

          the poncho. waiting. Angel, the last, drops his saddle bag,
          then crosses to the wall and drops down to rest. For a long
