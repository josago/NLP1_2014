<b>INT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.
</b>
The HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the
sound of Indian music -
MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk.
The electronic PEEP of the cash til.
A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes
her place second in the queue.
The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in
front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed
hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat.

<b>                        MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
</b>          One forty-nine please.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>          How much is the milk?

<b>                        MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
</b>          Forty-nine pence.
               (taking the change)
          Thank you.
MARGARET turns to leave, jostled by a tall young man
wired into an ipod.

<b>EXT. STREET. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.
</b>
MARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in
hand.


<b>INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
</b>MARGARET sits at breakfast with her husband DENIS,
sipping tea. DENIS butters his toast. MARGARET shakes her
head.

<b>                        MARGARET
</b>          Too much. Much too much butter.

<b>                        DENIS
</b>          I like butter.
<b>                        MARGARET
</b>          Milk's gone up.

<b>                                                                         2
</b>
            MARGARET reaches for a jug, pouring milk into it, sliding
            it down on a table.
<b>                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
</b>                      49p a pint.
<b>                                    DENIS
</b>                      Good grief! We'll have to
                      economise. I suppose we could
                      always sell the car.
                           (chuckles)
                      Or take in paying guests!
            He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door -
<b>                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
</b>                      Watch out. She's on the prowl.
            MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing
            commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs
            meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a
            distant corridor, steady on the approach.
<b>                                    MARGARET
</b>                           (to DENIS)
                      Eat your egg.
            JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now
            sitting tapping open her egg.
<b>                                    JUNE
</b>                      Goodness! There you are.
            JUNE's look of quiet concern.
<b>                                     MARGARET
</b>                      Yes.
            MARGARET eats her egg.
<b>                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
</b>                      Here we are.
            But for JUNE, she is entirely alone.


<b>            INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.
</b>
<b>            WHISPERING-
</b>
<b>                                    JUNE
</b>                      I don't understand how it
                      happened, how could she possibly
                      have got out? It's very very
                      important -

            MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the
            corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER.

<b>                                                                         3

</b>                      Please just make it really clear.
                      Who's on after you?

<b>                                       POLICE GUARD
</b>                      Dixon.

            MARGARET slips away.


<b>            INT.HALL. CHESTER SQUARE. DAY.
</b>
            MARGARET hurries through the hall.


<b>            INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.
</b>
            A wide cupboard-

            MARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her,
            her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and
            grey twill.

            JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back,
            letting in the sunlight-

<b>                                    JUNE
</b>                      Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a
                      start. Carol's coming soon, I'll
                      get some bags. Anything you want
                      to go to Mark, I'll bring up a
                      suitcase for it.

            The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand
            reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed
            and grey twill-

            He reaches for a suit.

<b>                                    MARGARET
</b>                      No no no no. The grey.

<b>                                       DENIS (O.S)
</b>                      You sure?

            The swipe of a clothes brush, briefly seen, drawn across
            one sleeve-

<b>                                       MARGARET
</b>                      Yes.

            Distant footsteps-

</b>                      ...Definitely the grey.

            JUNE returns, oblivious-

<b>                                                                         4

</b>                      Righty ho. Boss knows best.

            JUNE spies the newspaper, sees the photos of twisted
            carnage on the front page.

<b>                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
</b>                      Don't let her take my paper away.

            JUNE reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing-

<b>                                    MARGARET
</b>                      Oh, I haven't had a chance to look
                      at that yet, dear.

<b>                                    JUNE
</b>                      Sorry.

            JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed
            as she heads off with the suit on a hanger.

<b>                                    DENIS
</b>                      Atta-girl.

            DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway,
            soaping his face with shaving cream-

            He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until-

<b>                                    DENIS (O.S) (CONT'D)
</b>                      Damn.

            MARGARET looks up, DENIS has nicked his chin-

<b>                                    MARGARET
</b>                      Blot it...Blot it..

            She turns, sees JUNE, through the ajar door, standing in
            the corridor, looking back at her

<b>                                    JUNE

<b>            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
</b>
            A comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs
            and memorabilia of a former political life.

            MARGARET stands by the window, half a dozen of DENIS'
            ties in her hand. Pulling back the net curtain, MARGARET
            peers out-

            Two POLICEMAN stand down below next to a Police BMW car.
            They are lost in conversation, pointing to the door,
            clearly concerned.

<b>                                                                         5
</b>
            One POLICE MAN nods to the other, a sense of the changing
            of the guard as he drives off in the BMW.

            SUDDENLY from behind-

<b>                                    DENIS
</b>                      Now look what you've done. Are
                      they to keep the loonies out or
                      you in?

            MARGARET eyes DENIS, looking at her with wry smile -

<b>                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
</b>                      I'll be off then.

</b>                      Wear your scarf. There's a chill
                      out there.

            Suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the
            top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET's personal secretary
            carrying a cardboard box.

<b>                                    SUSIE

                      How are you feeling ?

<b>                                    MARGARET
</b>                      I'm fine, thank you Susie.

<b>                                    SUSIE
</b>                      I've just been reading about the
                      bombings.

<b>                                    MARGARET
</b>                      Yes. Frightful.

            SUSIE's mobile goes off.    She fumbles in her bag to
            switch it off.

<b>                                       SUSIE

                      sign. I brought as many as I could
                      find. Shall we go through your
                      appointments?

            MARGARET looks at her still nonplussed.

</b>                       The invitation has come from
                       Downing Street for the unveiling
                       of your portrait. I'll put it on
                       the mantelpiece, and there's an
                       invitation from Lord Armstrong for
                       lunch on the first Friday of next
                       month.

            The murmur of SUSIE's voice, a kind of white noise-

</b>                       I said no because you've got a

            SUSIE looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles
            back through the diary-

<b>                                     SUSIE

            An orchestra in full flight-

            MARGARET's gaze, seeing DENIS just visible in the street
            below. He looks up, smiles,

<b>                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
</b>                      He hasn't got his scarf on.

            MARGARET throws DENIS a half wave. In return, he twirls
            his umbrella and does a couple of steps of a Chaplin walk
            for her benefit before passing the Postman who is
            shuffling through his letters as he approaches the front
            step, below.

            SUSIE looks on with quiet concern.


<b>            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
</b>
            MARGARET' is at her desk signing a stack of her memoirs,
            The Downing Street Years.

            MARGARET opens one, reaching for a pen. The curve of inky
            handwriting as she begins to sign them, Margaret
            Thatcher.

            Close on the swoop of the pen. Without missing a beat,
            she writes the name Margaret Roberts...

            The insistent blare of an air raid siren from another
            time cuts through -

<b>            INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.
</b>
            The rumble of an approaching air raid overhead-

            The STEADY SHAKE of the table legs all around pulls out
            to reveal-

            BEATRICE ROBERTS [early 50's] austere, crouched next to
            MARGARET under a wide kitchen table along with ALFRED
            ROBERTS [early/mid 50's] a cumbersome man and MURIEL
            ROBERTS [21 yrs]. The sound of an air-raid siren.

                      should be encouraged to stand on
                      his own two feet. Yes we help
                      people of course we help people.
                      But for those that can do, they
                      must just get up and do. And if
                      something's wrong, they shouldn't
                      just whine about it, they should
                      get in there and DO something
                      about it, change things.

            SUDDENLY a closed fist reaches out, then opens to reveal
            a sugar mouse. Margaret's fingers reach for it, but it's
            teasingly withdrawn. Finally, she takes its.

            She turns to smile at DENIS, her face is glowing with

<b>            INT. TOWN HALL 1950. NIGHT.
</b>
            MARGARET sits on the edge of a trestle table, scrunching
            a rosette in her hand. The Town Hall is empty save for a
            couple of Volunteers stacking chairs and sweeping the
            floor. The litter of election night is everywhere.

                      Roberts lost her bid to win a seat
                      in Parliament today, but she has
                      put new life into the Dartford
                      Conservative Association. Winning
                      candidate Mr Dodds had better
                      watch out, this bright young woman
                      is on his tail.

            DENIS appears in the doorway, carrying fish and chips. He
            slides them down in front of her.

            DENIS fishes in his pocket pulling out a hip flask. An

            rosettes, the whiff of defeat all around.

            stool, hardly dressed for the beach, surrounded by papers
            weighed held down by pebbles. She merrily returns to her

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER. 1974. DAY
</b>
            MARGARET, now SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION, on the
            front bench, wearing a neat blue suit and a hat, a
            phalanx of MINISTERS sitting beside and around her, BLUE
            and GREY SUITED MEN, almost at first glance
            indistinguishable, with PRIME MINISTER EDWARD HEATH (late
            50's), neat, effete, slumped rather forlornly on the
            bench.

            MARGARET, her speech and papers in her hand is fighting
            hard but the OPPOSITION LABOUR BENCHES scent blood - and
            they literally bray, getting to their feet and shaking
            their order papers in her face.

            The SPEAKER tries to control the chamber but his VOICE is
            almost lost in the bedlam.

<b>                                    MARGARET
</b>                      The right honourable gentleman
                      knows that we have no choice but
                      to shut down the schools!

            Cries of `Shame!' From the opposition. The chamber
            reduced to a bear-pit. HEATH glum and offering no help to
            MARGARET whose voice becomes increasingly shrill.

<b>                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
</b>                      Because his union paymasters have
                      called a strike deliberately to
                      cripple our economy. Teachers
                      cannot teach when there is no
                      heating, no lighting in their
                      classrooms. And I ask the
                      honourable gentleman, whose fault
                      is that?

                      doth screech to much. If she wants
                      us to take her seriously she must
                      learn to calm down!

            The OPPOSITION BENCHES love that, rocking in their seats,
            laughing... falsely of course.

            But MARGARET is aware that there are many MEN behind her,
            on the government benches, who are also sniggering in
            agreement.

<b>                                    MARGARET
</b>                      If the right honorable gentleman
                      could perhaps attend more closely
                      to WHAT I am saying, rather than
                      HOW I am saying it, he may receive
                      a valuable education in spite of
                      himself!

            Her opposite number Shadow Minister looks almost smug:
            smiling, pointing a finger at her.

<b>                                    SHADOW MINISTER
</b>                      Why has this Conservative
                      government failed? Why has it
                      forced so many in the public
                      sector into taking strike action
                      to save their own jobs?

            for a Cabinet Meeting.

            All around, heaped high on either side as far as the eye
            can see are bags of rubbish. But not neatly stacked, just
            thrown there, many of them rotting down, spilling their
            filthy, putrid contents onto the street.

                      transport, electricity, sanitation
                      is not the fault of the trades

                      shamefully serve!

            The stench is awful - and MARGARET'S expression reflects
            that as she picks her way through.

</b>                      The miners are asking for a 35%
                      increase in wages. Obviously we
                      can't go anywhere near that. The
                      unions are not our enemies and
                      never have been. We want - and

            The MINISTERS nod. MARGARET determinedly edges a little
            forward so that she is in equal line with the other MALE

                      that we must do nothing for the
                      moment that will further inflame

            MARGARET leans forward for a better view, trying to catch
            his eye. HEATH wavers, mid-speech. All turn to look at
            MARGARET - who sits unwavering. HEATH resumes.

</b>                      - the fact of the matter is, it's
                      absolutely crucial that we are
                      seen by the public to be acting as
                      conciliators and not aggressors.

            her voice.

                      in a minute.

            A beam of light cuts through, just for an instant picking
            out HEATH'S moon-like face surrounded by darkness.
            MARGARET holds the small torch.

            MARGARET turns of the torch and clicks her handbag shut
            in satisfaction. Heath's words echo in her head,

                      be on my own.
            DENIS turns back for a moment -

                      You always have been.
            MARGARET calling out as DENIS reaches the window at the
            very far end of the house and appears to disappear into
            the white light-

            on a pile of DENIS' clothes. The bed is surrounded by
            bulging black bin bags.

            MARGARET's turns for a moment-
            It is JUNE. MARGARET shakes her head.

            The sound of hot water running. CHINK of a teacup-
            MARGARET stands, washing up a tea cup.
            The SQUEAK of her wet cloth, working on a stubborn tea
            stain, puncturing the silence.
            The sound of birdsong and children playing drifts from
            the street outside.
