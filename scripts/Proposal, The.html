<b>          INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
</b>
          The sun peeks over the horizon.   There's a stunning view of
          Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't
          watching.
          As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP,
          THUMP echoes through the apartment.   Eventually, we see MARGARET
          MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching "The O.C." on Tivo,
          and reading a manuscript.
          She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero.   As she
          hits a button to stop the treadmill...

<b>          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
</b>
          A hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up.   RICHARD
          PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure
          out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same
          model on the walls.
          Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is
          6:16 AM.   Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Where are my clothes?
          A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the
          model on the walls and is really, really hot.

<b>          SIMONE
</b>          In the kitchen.   I think.   Can I make you
          some coffee?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Sorry, I gotta go.   I'm late.
          Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block
          next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds
          his pants on the floor and puts them on.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Have you seen my belt?
          Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.

<b>          SIMONE
</b>          In here.
          She unties the complicated knot.   Richard comes back half
          dressed.   He swallows a little throwup.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Baby, I just can't do this anymore.

</b>
          Margaret puts on a black suit jacket.   Definitely not off the
          rack.   She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves
          off.

<b>          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
</b>
          Reflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly
          gets dressed as he talks.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You're just too much for me.   And I'm just
          another guy too wrapped up in his job.

<b>          SIMONE
</b>          Fine.   Whatever.   Just go.
          Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Let's not end it like that. It's been an
          amazing three and a half weeks.   Thank you.
          And you should know that you have the nicest
          ass I've ever been with.

<b>          SIMONE
</b>
<b>          (TOUCHED)
</b>          You mean it?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I do.   It's magnificent.

<b>          SIMONE
</b>          I work really hard on it.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I know you do.
          Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her
          naked body.   Richard shakes his head "no" and smiles.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I really gotta go.

<b>          INT. MARGARET'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
</b>
          CRUNCH.   Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while
          standing and reading a manuscript.   Her eyes remain glued to her
          reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher.
          Her apartment is very quiet.

<b>          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING
</b>
          HONK!   A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the
          street.   His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch.

</b>
          DING!   The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit
          and the DOORMAN (60).   Before Margaret gets to the door, her CELL
          PHONE RINGS.   She checks the caller ID and excitedly points at
          her phone as she lets it ring.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (to phone)
          I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me
          what I want to hear.   Give it to me.

<b>          DOORMAN
</b>          You have to put it by your mouth so people
          can hear you.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You should get paid extra for being so darn
          funny.
          Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out
          the door.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          This is Margaret.

<b>          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING

          Richard bursts into the skyscraper and runs into a Starbucks.

<b>          INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Two coffees lie in wait for Richard.   JILLIAN, a lovely Barista,
          smiles as he hurries to the counter.

<b>          JILLIAN
</b>          You're running late today.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Jillian, you are the best.

<b>          JILLIAN
</b>          If you think I'm good at this, you should
          use that coffee cup sometime.
          As he runs out the door, Richard glances at his cup and smiles at
          Jillian's name and phone number written in Sharpie.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          See ya tomorrow.

          The elevator doors ahead of Richard begin to close.

</b>          Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors.   Inside the
          packed elevator, Richard's CO-WORKERS look sleepy.   One
          particularly frustrated co-worker confronts Richard.

<b>          CO-WORKER #1
</b>          How long is she gonna make us come in by
          seven?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          She doesn't exactly consult with me on these
          things.

<b>          CO-WORKER #1
</b>          Well this sucks ass.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Welcome to my nightmare.
          The doors close as...

<b>          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING
</b>
          Margaret crosses the street and talks on the phone.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You've been thinking about our talk because
          I'm right.   Everyone does publicity.   Roth,
          McCourt, Russo.   Hell, Chabon practically
          whores himself.   Know what they have in
          common?   A Pulitzer.
          (off answer)
          Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty
          years, but that's how long it's been since
          you've written a book this good.

<b>          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING
</b>
          Richard bursts out of the elevator and passes a clock reading
          6:56 and a sign that announces "Royce Publishing."   He hauls ass
          through a sea of cubicles.   Along the way, grumpy employees
          begrudgingly nod their good mornings.
          At his desk, he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on
          without looking in the mirror.   Noticing his wrinkled suit, he
          pulls out a SPRAY BOTTLE out of the same drawer, sprays it all
          over his body, and then on his head to help mat down a tricky
          cowlick.   Satisfied, he hurries into a nearby corner office.

<b>          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING

          Margaret walks into the lobby and continues talking.   Employees
          avoid her and pile into the elevator.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books,
          I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the
          world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius
          piece of literature.   Do the publicity.
          Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears "yes."
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You're making the right decision!   Great
          news.   Going into an elevator, think I'm
          going to lose you...
          Margaret hangs up.   Never give them a chance to change their
          mind.

<b>          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
          Richard races to Margaret's computer and turns it on.   He picks
          up papers strewn about the room.   He goes back to the computer,
          and opens computer programs.

<b>          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - RECEPTION - MORNING
</b>
          Margaret exits the elevator and receives an enthusiastic...

<b>          RECEPTIONIST
</b>          Good morning!
          Margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod.

<b>          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING
</b>
          Margaret walks through the cubicles and nods hello to her staff,
          who all look busy on the phone.   When she turns the corner, they
          stop their "conversations" in mid sentence and hang up.

<b>          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
          Richard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out.   A
          clock above the door reads 7:00 AM.   The paper clears the printer
          and Richard grabs it quickly.

<b>          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING
</b>
          Margaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing
          at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other.
          Her office looks perfect.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You've got a conference call in thirty, a
          staff meeting at nine, and your immigration
          lawyer sent some papers for you to sign.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Nice job.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          When I want your praise, I'll ask for it.
          Is Bob here?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I'm sure.   You want him on the phone?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          We're going to his office.   Grab your pad.
          Richard calmly backs out of the office...

<b>          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          ... but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer
          and sends an instant message to the office "The Banshee is headed
          to Bob's office."

<b>          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING
</b>
          As the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to
          life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes
          their imaginary conversations.

<b>          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - MORNING
</b>
          Margaret comes out to Richard's desk.   She notices his coffee cup
          with Jillian's number on it.   She takes special notice of the
          hearts that dot the "I's" in Jillian.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          That's cute.   You gonna call her today?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          What?
          Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she
          nods at the cup.   He's embarrassed.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Are you bored here?   Do you need little
          distractions like that to get you through
          the day?

</b>          Margaret starts walking.   Richard quickly catches up, worried
          because he doesn't know where she's going with this.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got
          hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head,
          and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Oh.   Well, it won't be wrinkled for long.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You'll magically unwrinkle?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yes.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You have magic pants?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          No.   I've sprayed them with stuff that will
          take care of the wrinkles.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Does this work on more than just your pants?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Anything that's wrinkled.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Buy me some.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Will do.
          Richard makes a note.   Margaret stops to make her point.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I don't care what or who you do on your own
          time, but when you walk through that door
          you represent me, and I will not have your
          personal life affect you at work.   If you
          want me to think of promoting you to editor,
          I need you sharp, focused and professional.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Got it.

          Margaret and Richard enter Bob's office, which is decorated with
          beautiful antiques and first edition books.   But unlike
          Margaret's office, this one isn't in the corner.
          Margaret nods at Richard to shut the door.   BOB (42) wears a prim
          bow tie, circular tortoise shell glasses, and the air of
          superiority.

</b>          Hey, Bob.

<b>          BOB
</b>          It is.   He doesn't do publicity.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I just talked to him.   He's in.

</b>          No more buts, Bob.   I've been chief for a

</b>          What's he doing?
          Richard turns around and takes a peek.   Bob gets out of his chair
          and comes to his door.

</b>          He's up and about to pop.

</b>          The office stops.   This is going to be good.   Margaret turns
          around with a disappointed look on her face.   She's deadly calm.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What are you doing?   I gave you a civilized
          way out of this.

<b>          BOB
</b>          This is because I'm your competition.

          happened.   And get Frank's publicity
          schedule figured out pronto.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          No problem.   I'll just cancel my trip this
          weekend.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I gave you the weekend off?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday.
          But no big deal.   You were right before, I
          need to stay focused.   Professional.

<b>          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - DAY
</b>
          Richard is on the phone with his mom explaining why he can't come
          home this weekend.   He sounds like an annoyed teenager.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Well tell gammy that I'm sorry.
          (waiting to speak)
          Mom, she's making me work this weekend.
          It's not like I volunteered.
          (waiting to speak)
          I'm sure dad is pissed.
          Margaret comes to Richard's desk.   He tries to wrap it up.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I have to go.   Yeah.   No, I'm not going to
          do that!   No.   Sorta.   Mom!   No.   Bye.
          Richard hangs up the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Sorry about that.   Damage control.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          She tell you to quit?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          No.   No.
          (off Margaret's look)
          Um.   Yes?   But as I've explained to them,
          after three years together, you're the only
          person on the planet who can make me editor,
          so that's the way it is.
          Richard's phone rings and he picks it up.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          11.
</b>          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Your 10:55 is here.   Mr. Gilbertson?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Who is this guy?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          He said you knew each other.   You weren't
          sure so you told me to set a meeting.   We
          rescheduled on him four times.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Go get him.   But he's out of here in five
          minutes, we've got work to do.
          Margaret leaves and goes into her office.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (to himself)
          I'll charge up the cattle prod.

<b>          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          Margaret reads as MR. GILBERTSON (48) sits down.   He's an intense
          man in a bad suit.   He sits in silence until Margaret looks up.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Margaret.   Good to see you.   I know how busy
          you are.   Congrats on the promotion.   Read
          about it in P-W.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yeah.   Well, those announcements are silly,
          aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to
          know doesn't know already.
          Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man,
          but now gives up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Have to admit, I can't place where we know
          each other from.
          Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Three years ago?   We worked together.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Don't have it...

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Remember "Dandelion's Desire?"
          Margaret gets excited.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          12.
</b>
<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me?
          That book is legend.   Without a doubt the
          worst ever written.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          You think?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          It was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and
          pointless pages, with like 30 characters,
          who all had some weird disability.   The
          paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering
          scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic
          alien chapter -- written entirely in his
          alien language.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          I believe there was a glossary...
          Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Did you see the pass letter I wrote him?

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>
<b>          (QUOTING)
</b>          "Your grammar is impeccable, but please do
          not confuse superior form with writing
          ability.   Save your skills for the office
          newsletter, you sir, are no writer."
          A beat.   Margaret says matter of fact...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You wrote the book.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          I did.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You're Dante Dickens?

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          One of my nom de plumes.
          Gilbertson paces.   Margaret stays seated, at a loss.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You
          obviously were spending a lot of time
          writing, I just thought you should channel
          all that passion into something else.
          Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          13.
</b>
<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and
          Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you
          to Canada.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Excuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've
          lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for
          citizenship.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          You need citizenship now?   After the big
          promotion?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yes.   And all the papers are in.
          Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Well, my office is going to reject your
          paperwork on Monday, while we investigate
          whether your behavior is well disposed to
          the good order and happiness of the United
          States.   We must protect our sovereignty.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the
          United States?

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will
          take awhile, so you'll be deported while
          your case winds through the system.
          (as if he doesn't know)
          Will it affect you at work if you aren't
          allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two
          to three years?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          "Affect me at work?"   I'll lose my job!

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          (mock sympathy)
          Ahhhh.   That's a shame.   Too bad we can't
          work something out.
          Margaret stops looking at her file.   It all becomes clear.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Oh, no.   No, no, no.   I won't do it.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Do what, Ms. Mills?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          14.
</b>          Gilbertson smiles.   She's quick.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          I've edited it down.   It's better.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Well then, get it published at another
          house.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          They all just don't get me.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          All?

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Well not all.   Two hundred fifty, two
          hundred sixty-one.   Ish.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'll be fired and laughed out of the
          industry if I publish that book.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          I'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills.   I'm
          an author.   Not some bureaucrat who brings a
          lunchable to work everyday and lives in his
          brother's garage.   You're the last stop, and
          I'm desperate.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I will never publish your book.   Ever.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          There's no need to make this difficult.   I
          don't turn in your file until Monday...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          This is blackmail.   I'll go to your boss.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          I've spent two years preparing for this day.
          Don't you think I've thought of that?
          Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on.
          Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there
          is an "emergency" so Margaret can end the meeting.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs
          you right away.
          The sight of Richard inspires Margaret.   She turns to Gilbertson
          with a wicked grin on her face.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          15.
</b>
<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Know what, Dante?   I'm not going anywhere!
          We're getting married!
          Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Who's getting married?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          We are!

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You and him?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Stop playing around, honey.
          Margaret is all smiles.   Richard is very confused.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS.   I told him
          about us.   About us getting married.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          You are marrying your male secretary?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Assistant.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          You are marrying your male assistant?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (matter of fact)
          We're in love.   We tried to fight it.   When
          it's right, it's right.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          And this has nothing to do with my visit
          here today?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Nope.   True love.   Got it bad.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          (to Richard)
          You.   Is this true?   Are you marrying
          this... woman?
          Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Of course we are.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          16.
</b>          Painfully long beat where Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret
          squeezes Richard's hand hard.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Uh-huh.
          Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm
          around her.   Richard is truly afraid.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (more of a question)
          I'm, uh, marrying my boss?
          Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that
          she's ready for a kiss.   The two slowly begin to come together.
          Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out
          and kisses the hair on the top of her head.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Five years in prison and a two hundred and
          fifty thousand dollar fine.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What?

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          If I prove you're lying, you go to federal
          prison for five years.
          Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          (to Richard)
          You.   Do you know what you're getting
          yourself into?   We're going to put you in a
          room and ask you every detail that a real
          couple would know about each other.   Do you
          even know her favorite color?
          Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret encourages him on with a thinly
          veiled threat.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          C'mon.   Answer.   You don't have a choice.
          Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Plum.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          You mean purple?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          No.   Plum is "smokier" than purple.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          17.
</b>
<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Favorite flower?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Tulips.   But only when they're in season.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Childhood pet name?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Miss Mittens.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Are we done here?

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Who knows you're getting married?
          Margaret interrupts.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          No one.   With us working together we decided
          it would be too much of a scandal if anyone
          knew.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Have you at least told your family?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (EXCITED)
</b>          My parents are dead!

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          How convenient.   So you're not telling
          anyone that you are getting married?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Nope.
          Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Pathetic.   Four questions and I've got
          enough to send you to prison...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          We're telling his family this weekend.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          We are?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yes.   We are.   We're surprising them...
          (trying to remember)
          ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          18.
</b>
<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          And where's that going to be?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (no idea)
          At Richard's parent's house.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          And where's that located?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (still no idea)
          In his hometown.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Sitka.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Is that on Long Island?
          Only Richard has the answer.   Margaret tries to cover.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Why don't you tell him?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Alaska.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          You're going to Alaska this weekend?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (Alaska???)
          Yes.   Of course we're going to Alaska.
          That's where Richard is from.
          Gilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          You think you can beat me with this B-S
          story?   Forcing your secretary...

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Assistant.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          ...assistant to marry you and then
          conveniently telling his family for the
          first time this weekend?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm sorry, Dante.   Did you not prepare for
          that?
          Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          19.
</b>          Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his
          appointment book and writes down some information.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          The INS will see you both in ten days for
          your official interview.   Your stories
          better match up on every account.
          Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her
          the piece of paper.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          Cross all your T's and dot your I's with
          this ruse, Ms. Mills.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          There are no "T's" or "I's" in "Love" Mr.
          Gilbertson.
          Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard.   Margaret goes back to
          her desk like this is all in a days work.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Why are you from Alaska?   Sweet Jesus,
          that's inconvenient.   So here's what's going
          to happen.   We'll play boyfriend and
          girlfriend this weekend for your parents and
          that should be enough for this INS
          interview.
          Richard doesn't react.   Margaret doesn't notice.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          So you need to figure out the travel,

          But first, run down and get me another
          coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold.
          Margaret holds out her coffee cup.   Richard doesn't move.

          Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left.

          Richard can't take it.   He gets up in Margaret's face.

</b>          Um.   Shouldn't we talk about what we're

</b>          So what do I need to know up there?   Bullet

          PEOPLE with excited looks on their faces.
          Richard's mom DEBBIE (60) is front and center.   She's a sweet
          lady who cooked Richard a hot breakfast every morning until he
          left the house.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (89) also waits.   She's lived a long time and
          doesn't have a lot of time to screw around.

</b>          Have a great life.
          Margaret walks toward the group.   Richard puts out his hand and
          silently pleads for Margaret to hold it.   At the last second, she
          takes it.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Engagement party tonight...

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          ...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight.
          Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Are you witches?

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Just quaint.   During the solstice it's good
          luck.   It's an Alaskan thing.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          We've planned everything.
          Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          I'm old, Margaret.   I don't have much time
          left.   Richard lives so far away, and I
          never see him.   Now I find out he's getting
          married, and I have a chance to see my one
          grandchild's wedding day.   It's a dream come
          true for me.   A dream come true.   Please let
          me see Richard get married before I die.
          Please.
          Long beat.   Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.
          Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.   Finally,
          she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up.
          The crowd cheers.

<b>          EXT. SITKA - DAY
</b>
          A procession of cars makes its way through town.

<b>          INT. PICKUP - DAY
</b>
          Debbie and Grandma sit in the front of the truck, all smiles.
          Margaret and Richard sit as far away from each other as possible
          in the backseat of the extended cab.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          30.
</b>          Margaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out
          the window.   Finally she pinches him and Richard jumps. He gives
          Margaret a "what did you do that for" look.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (MOUTHING)
</b>          The Dragon Lady!?
          Richard shrugs.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the
          plans made already for my birthday.   Just a
          few changes here and there, and we made this
          weekend a wedding.
          Margaret stares at Richard.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm a lucky woman.
          Margaret does her best to smile.

<b>          EXT. DOCK - DAY
</b>
          The cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small
          dock.   Everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the
          ocean.   Margaret is confused.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm not getting out of this car until you
          tell me where we're going.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Come on, it'll be OK.   I promise.
          Richard points to a small island about a mile away.

<b>          EXT. YACHT - DAY
</b>
          Everyone rides on a 75 foot yacht.   Lots of polished wood and
          chrome.   Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is
          festive.   Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Who are you people?
          Richard lets Margaret wonder.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY
</b>
          The ship docks and we get our first glimpse of the Paxton Estate.
          It sits above the rest of the wooded island and is as tasteful as
          a 15 bedroom Alaskan mansion can be.
          Richard's father, GEOFFREY (60) waits on the dock. He is a bear

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          31.
</b>
<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          So you must be Margaret.   We've heard a lot
          about you.   All of it bad.
          Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical
          sling backs.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he
          was marrying the devil woman.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I thought it was the dragon lady?

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Either way.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Hey dad.
          Richard shakes his father's hand.   It's a little stiff.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Welcome home.   Good to see â€˜ya.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You too.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Been a while.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yeah.   You'd think you could make it to the
          airport to mark the occasion.
          Grandma Annie interrupts.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Help him with the bags Geoffrey.
          (to Richard and Margaret)
          Let's get you two settled.
          As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots
          Geoffrey a look that says "be nice".

<b>          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
</b>
          The house is decked out in sheik Alaskan decor.   Somehow, it
          makes bear heads and deer antlers look good.   Everything is first
          class.   Margaret is a little awe struck.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          We'll show you around later.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Uh huh.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          32.
</b>          Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps
          on her.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Balzac!   Down!   No!
          Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the
          kitchen.   Margaret tries to take it in stride and make small
          talk.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What a great name.   Balzac's "Lost
          Illusions" is one of my favorite novels.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Oh.   Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis.
          Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to
          illustrate how Balzac really got his name.
          Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks
          away.   Off her shocked reaction, we understand right away that
          this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel.
          DEBBIE (cont'd)
          No one on the island wanted him when he was
          born.   We figured he deserved a home.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          And don't let him outside, or the eagles
          will snatch him.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          C'mon dad...

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          I mean it.   They come out of that
          rehabilitation center mean.   And hungry.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Don't listen to him, Margaret.

<b>          INT. PAXTON ESTATE UPSTAIRS - DAY
</b>
          Debbie opens a door for Richard and Margaret.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          You'll be sleeping here.

<b>          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          The room is beautiful, right out of Architectural Digest.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Bathroom is there, all the towels are in the
          armoire by the bed.   Just let me know if you

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          33.
</b>
<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Thank you.   Where's Richard's room?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Oh, we took down his "shrine" years ago.
          And don't worry, I'm under no illusion that
          you two haven't slept in the same bed
          before.   Richard can sleep here too.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          It was her idea.   Anything to help get her a
          great grandchild.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Great.   You know, I've gotten used to his
          breathing at night.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          I thought so dear.
          Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her
          old self.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm about 15 seconds from bitch.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Calm down.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What is going on here?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Hell if I know.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You had no idea they knew about us getting
          married?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You think I'd bring you here if I did?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Well, we just gotta tell â€˜em.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Tell â€˜em what?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Tell â€˜em the truth.   About us.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          34.
</b>
<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Wrong answer.   No way.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What do you mean no way?   This is crazy.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          No, crazy was lying to the federal officer.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Well I don't like this.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice
          to a Class C felony!   For one second could
          you not be so selfish?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Selfish?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you
          only worry about yourself every second of
          every day?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          How is it selfish to tell the truth?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Look.   We're awful, awful people.   In the
          last forty eight hours, we've lied to...
          everyone.   We need to protect the people
          downstairs.   We can't ask these good,
          decent, not awful people to lie for us.
          Let's keep the darkside to ourselves.
          Margaret takes a second to make up her mind.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop
          lying to me.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          What've I lied to you about?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Why did you tell me that you were poor?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I never said that.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Well, you never told me you were rich.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          When does that come up?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          35.
</b>
<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is
          Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry."

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you
          would have fired me if you knew.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          No I wouldn't.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Come on!   You're always yammering on about
          your scrappy childhood, and how you fought
          for those soccer scholarships, and how the
          rich kids made fun of you in prep school for
          working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti-
          rich.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm not anti-rich.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Oh yes you are!   And you know what makes it
          worse?   You have money!

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I earned...

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          ...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah.
          You need new material.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You were going to promote me anyway.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Sure of that?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Nope.   Not at all.
          Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Well, come on.   If we're going to do this,
          we might as well put on a show.

<b>          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
</b>
          Downstairs, the engagement party is in full swing.   The starched
          wait staff stands out in the crowd, because the raucous party-
          goers are all dressed in flannel, T-shirts and baseball hats.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          36.
</b>          Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy
          hair and beards.   No dress code here.
          Like the house, the party is first class.   Ice sculptures melt,
          champagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows
          with salmon and king crab.
          Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some
          WELL WISHERS, Richard's parents, and Balzac.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I went to Union college in upstate New York.
          It's a small liberal arts school that no one
          has ever heard of.
          Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (looks at glass)
          Lime?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Be right back.
          Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges.   Geoffrey elbows Debbie in
          the side, "What was that?"

<b>          WELL WISHER #1
</b>          How long have you been with your company?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Since I graduated college.
          Richard comes back with the lime.   Margaret takes it and doesn't
          say thank you.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          She's been there since she was nineteen.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Nineteen?   Wow.   That's how long?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Oh, who's counting...
          Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          No.   How many years is that?   Exactly.
          Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Well, let me see.   That would be sixteen or
          seventeen years.   Exactly.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          37.
</b>
<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          I was never good with big numbers.   That
          makes you... thirty six now?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Just turned thirty seven.   Born on May 20th.
          I'm a Taurus.
          Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Richard)
          I need some protein.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          There's some salmon.
          Margaret shakes her head no.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Crab?
          Margaret nods yes.   Richard steps away to find a waiter.
          Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Keep him on a short leash, huh?   Does he
          roll over when you whistle?
          Debbie hits Geoffrey.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          He's just being a good host.
          Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow.   For Geoffrey's
          benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Thank you, honey.   You're being so sweet.
          Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Uh, sure.   Honey.

<b>          WELL WISHER #2
</b>          So you just got some big promotion?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm editor in chief, now.
          Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>
<b>          (BEAMING)
</b>          I'm so proud of my girl.

<b>          38.
</b>          From behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts.

<b>          VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Editor in chief?   You're marrying up,
          Richard.
          Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26).   She is
          Grace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland.   Adding insult to
          injury, she doesn't have eyeliner on.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Gert!?
          Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and
          spilling her tonic water on her shirt.   He doesn't notice what
          he's done, and leaves Margaret.   She's peeved.
          RICHARD (cont'd)

<b>          (FLUSTERED)
</b>          What are you?   What are you doing here?

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Your dad made me come.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          From Chicago?
          Gertrude laughs.   The group watches these two see each for the
          first time in years.   There is instant chemistry, and Richard has
          forgotten about Margaret completely.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          No.   I live here now.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You what?

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          I moved back about six months ago.   I'm
          teaching second grade.   At Baranof.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Did your husband move up here too?

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Uh, no.   I, ah, got divorced.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Oh my God.   I'm sorry.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Me too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna

          Hi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You're a Gertrude?

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          A family name from hell.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm sure it's been a curse.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Gert and Richard were quite the item in high
          school.
          Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Oh Please.   Ancient history.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Feels like yesterday to me.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          (ignoring Geoffrey)
          So tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't
          exactly love at first sight?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Not exactly...

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Now Richard, what I want to know is how you
          proposed.
          This grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a
          story like this.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Well...
          Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Uh, uh, um, I...

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Yeah.   How did you pop the question?
          Richard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly.
          Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Can I tell this one, honey?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Uh.   Sure.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm an early, early riser and go for a run
          everyday.   Well, it was our six month
          anniversary and I was out for my normal jog
          in the park, when who do I see in a horse
          drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting
          for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So
          I ran up to the carriage and asked him what
          was going on, and he put his finger to his
          lips and says, "shhhh."   So there I am in my
          jogging clothes, next to the most handsome
          mute in the world - have you seen him in a
          tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and
          smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later,
          we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best
          part, we're the only people in the place
          because Richard got them to open up early.
          Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just
          as the sun starts to peek above the trees,
          this beautiful man gets down on one knee,
          and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to
          go by without you knowing that you are the
          light of my life, and that I would be the
          luckiest man in the world if you would be my
          wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry
          me?"
          The group is silent, waiting for the clincher.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I said yes.
          The group gives a collective "ahh".   Grandma Annie takes both
          Margaret and Richard by the hand.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          You are a good boy Richard, and you make me
          very proud.   I love you Richy.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I love you too, Grandma.
          Grandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and
          Gertrude.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          So did this happen before or after the INS
          agent came sniffing around?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          What is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret.
          Margaret doesn't miss a beat.

</b>
<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Oh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my
          lawyers have been dealing with all of this.
          When you told us at the airport it was the
          first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so
          embarrassed.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Don't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass.
          While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink
          that says "I've got this under control".   The moment is
          interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He
          takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Margaret Mill's phone.
          (off answer)
          One second please.
          Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          It's our friend, Frank.
          Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Excuse me, I'll just be a second.
          Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that
          lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't
          notice Balzac follow her outside.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.   Balzac
          follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the
          wishy washy writer who changes his mind
          every two seconds.
          Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING
          to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking.
          Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the
          phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Balzac)
          Sit and be quiet!
          Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone
          back to her ear.

<b>

</b>          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I fired Bob because he didn't have your best
          interest in mind.   Our job is to help you
          succeed.   He wasn't doing that.
          Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she
          notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not
          sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him
          peacefully sit in the grass.
          She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret
          shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when --
          WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and
          takes off.   Margaret jumps.
          There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle.
          She stays calm on the phone.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Could you hold on just a second?
          With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the
          eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and
          Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened.
          Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone
          and picks it up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

<b>          (NONCHALANT)
</b>          Sorry, dropped my phone.
          Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in
          circles above her.   She decides to wrap up the call quick and get
          back to the house.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything.
          But know this.   This book is your legacy...
          Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac
          again.   She runs.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to
          introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me-
          tomorrow-with-your-decision.   My-phone is-
          always-on.   Talk-to-you-soon.
          The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle
          is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone
          to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs
          Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks.

</b>          Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the
          eagle as an offering.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Take the dog!   Take the dog!

          Inside, the elegant party carries on.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Where's Margaret?   We need to go.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Go where?

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          It's a surprise.   Girls are going into town.
          And the boys stay here.   I told you, we've
          planned everything.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Um.   She's outside.
          Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window.
          They see Margaret running with Balzac above her head.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Oh that's sweet, she's playing with my

<b>          EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY

          The eagle is long gone, but Margaret is still running with the
          dog trying to bait it back.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle.   C'mon,
          bring back the phone.
          Richard calls out from the house.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Your dad was right!   The eagle tried to take
          the dog, so I saved it, then it came back

          The Pioneer bar is a classic Alaskan bar, decorated with pictures
          of every fishing vessel that has made Sitka its home.
          But tonight estrogen rules, as all the patrons are women CHEERING
          for an oiled, toned, and BEARDED MAN in a tiny thong who gyrates
          to the beat of Prince's "Sexy Motherfucker."   On stage with the
          dancer, Margaret tries to not look miserable in her NOVELTY

<b>          BACHELORETTE PARTY WEDDING VEIL WITH DEVIL HORNS.
</b>
<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Work it Hank!

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Is that a salmon down your pants?
          The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from
          Margaret's face.   Margaret remains straight faced.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Definitely not a salmon.
          The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his
          wiggling ass and gives her a feel.   She can't help but give and
          embarrassed smile.   Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the
          splits.   Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation.
          Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek.   She
          begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.

<b>          HANK
</b>          Ah, ah, ah.   I was just the warm up.
          Hank sits Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What's going on?

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Just sit there dear.

</b>          Don't be shy ladies, tip well and often,
          show Hank how much you appreciate his
          assets!   And now... Ramone!
          The room goes silent as a middle aged RAMONE comes on to the
          stage.   He has a pot belly, threadbare thong and a thin mustache.
          Ramone's dance has a Latin theme to it, and he's very good at it.
          Margaret is oblivious.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What's that smell?
          Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about
          an inch away from her face.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (belly laugh)
          Ahhh!!!
          Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone.
          After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger
          at her naughty behavior.

<b>          RAMONE
</b>          You are a naughty devil.
          Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns,
          Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Good lord.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Ramone was the only male dancer on the
          island for years. No one has the heart to
          tell him to hang it up.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Want me to do it?

          Snow capped mountains watch 20 MEN in short sleeves hit golf
          balls into the ocean.   Green pontoon rafts bob in the water, made
          up to look like golf greens.   Golf balls are stacked in pyramid
          formations at every hitting area.
          Richard comes down from the house to join the group.   Geoffrey
          jokes with MR. MAGUIRE (60's, good natured) as they hit balls.

<b>          GEOFFREY

          Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with
          one another for the first time.   Things are awkward between
          father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid

</b>          So this is all about what you want?

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          That's not what I said.

          Margaret steps outside to have a moment to herself.   She's on a
          patio overlooking the ocean.   It is late, but the sun is hanging
          just over the horizon.

<b>          GERTRUDE

          Yeah.   I miss it.   Believe me, growing up I
          never thought I'd end up divorced and back
          here teaching at my old elementary school.
          That was always Richard's plan.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          For you to get divorced?

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          (smiles, remembering)
          No.   I was going to teach, he was going to
          run his dad's business.   He was like a
          little old man.   Had it all worked out.

          Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          He proposed to me.   When we were seniors.
          Margaret laughs.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed
          to you in high school?

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          He bought this sweet little ring, and got
          down on his knee.   It was so cute.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You must have...

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          ... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up
          with him on the spot.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I would hope so.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          After getting rejected the first time, I
          can't imagine how hard it was for him to get
          up the courage to ask you.
          Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is
          being so honest with her.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Anyway.   The idea that my little old man
          could be a player...   It's just not the

          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get

          Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers.

          THWACK!   An axe slams down and splits a log in two.   Hands
          quickly place another log down and THWACK!   We pull back to find
          Richard playing the role of executioner.   He's still mad after
          talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood.   Rage
          Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world.
          Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht.
          Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves.   Debbie's
          mood deflates when she sees Richard.

          With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear

          Annie shakes her head.   Something is up.

          Geoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch
          plasma television.   The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step
          in front of the TV, blocking his view.   Margaret watches from the
          door, not sure what is going on.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Excuse me?   I'm watching that.

</b>          I am so tired.
          Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad.

          off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for

          looks genuinely unnerved.

          Richard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite
          a sweat.     He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through

          Geoffrey defends himself to Debbie and Annie with great
          conviction.   Richard walks right by the fighting trio, but
          doesn't notice anyone.   He continues to listen to his iPod and
          his attention is focused on the controls, as he looks for the
          playlist "Songs I Shouldn't Like" and Charlene's hit "I've Been

          has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Richard, is that you?

<b>          IN THE BEDROOM
</b>          Richard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an
          incredibly absorbent Egyptian cotton towel.

<b>          IN THE BATHROOM
</b>          Margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was.   Richard
          isn't there, but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting
          for her.   How did she miss that?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Richard, are you...
          Then out of nowhere, Balzac (he followed Richard in) startles
          Margaret.

<b>          BALZAC
</b>          Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!
          Margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass.   Her foot
          kicks the door open as she retreats from the vengeful puppy.

<b>          ON THE BEDROOM'S DECK
</b>          Richard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on
          the deck attached to the room.   He makes sure that no one is in
          the yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs them up as well.

<b>          IN THE BATHROOM
</b>          Naked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret
          manages to pull herself up by the toilet.   She wants a towel
          badly, but Balzac guards the doorway.   She tries reason.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm sorry bout the eagle.   But I saved you.
          Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily.   Margaret grabs
          the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.

<b>          ON THE BEDROOM DECK
</b>          Richard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is
          open.   That's weird.

</b>          Margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat,
          ready to strike.   Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues
          to growl and not let her out of the bathroom.   Margaret knows
          that she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out.   Then
          she spots the bathroom mat.

<b>          IN THE BEDROOM
</b>          Richard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod.

<b>          IN THE BATHROOM
</b>          Balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat.
          Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top.
          Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls
          hard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the
          bathroom.   With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the
          door behind her and...

<b>          IN THE BEDROOM
</b>          WHAM!   Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor.
          It takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each
          other buck naked.

          You're flashing brain!
          Richard quickly changes positions.   Out of desperation, he pulls
          the entire comforter off the bed.   He throws it Margaret's way,
          and she wraps herself in it.

          Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with
          the sun still shining outside.   She gets into her bed.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm never gonna to get to sleep.
          Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down
          outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and
          the room is pitch black.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh.   Well.   Thanks.
          Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two
          silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          It was kinda weird seeing you naked.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Can we not talk about this?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I'm just saying.   It was weird.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          It wasn't weird.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          How was that not weird?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Because we're... like teammates.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          We're like teammates?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          We are teammates.   And teammates see each
          other naked in the locker room.   All the
          time.   It's not a big deal.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the
          bed?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Good night, Richard.
          The two lay awake in silence for another beat.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Margaret?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yes?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Don't take this the wrong way.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Okay...

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You're a very beautiful woman.
          Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.

<b>          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          Not a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into
          his office.   He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic
          oak desk.   He finds a phone number with a New York City area code
          on a piece of paper.   He dials.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Yes.   Mr. Gilbertson?   My name is Geoffrey
          Paxton...
          Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the
          rest of the conversation.

<b>          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Margaret wakes up.   She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor
          with a blanket and a pillow.   She stares maybe a beat too long,
          before there is a KNOCK on the door.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Who is it?

<b>          DEBBIE (O.S.)
</b>          It's me dear.   I made you two breakfast in
          bed.   Can I come in?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (STALLING)
</b>          Uh, sure.   Just a second.
          Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden
          sailboat to wake him up.   She hits him in the head.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          What the...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (MOUTHING)
</b>          Your mother.
          Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his
          makeshift bed.   He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts
          his arm around Margaret.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Come on in mom!
          Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Well, it's your special day.
          Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on
          the edge of the bed.   She is buzzing with excitement.
          DEBBIE (cont'd)
          You two need your energy, so eat up.   We've
          got your dress fitting, have to get the
          house ready, and then your wedding.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new
          phone.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Will you pick up some champagne while you're
          there?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          No problem.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          And don't be gone for too long.   Lots of
          work to be done!

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You don't have to go to all this trouble.
          Really.
          Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Don't be silly.   This is the biggest day of
          your life.   You are coming into this family,
          and when it's family, it's no trouble.   If
          your parents were with us, they would do the
          exact same.
          Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes.   Richard
          jumps out of bed and goes to the food.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (TOUCHED)
</b>          Your mom is just so sweet.   I haven't had
          someone make me breakfast in bed since I was
          a little kid.
          Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (mouth full)
          I wish she hadn't.   I mean she almost caught
          us.   Damn, that was close.
          Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay
          attention to Margaret.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You just take all this for granted?   Your
          family, this house...
          Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (mouth full)
          I'm sorry, what?   You gotta try these.
          Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Why are you doing this to them?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Huh?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Why am I here?   You didn't have to bring me
          here.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You made me bring you here!   You told me I

<b>          
</b>
<b>          61.
</b>
<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I didn't make you do anything.   You could of
          said no.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          And what?   Start over at the bottom again?
          No way.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I get why a not rich person would do this.
          But you've got everything.   It doesn't make
          any sense.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Know what?   This is none of your business.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I wish it wasn't my business.   But
          unfortunately, it has become my business,
          because I made a deal with someone I thought
          I could trust.
          Richard stares at Margaret for a beat.   He's exasperated.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You wanna know why you're here?   I'll show
          you why you're here.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Fine.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          We leave in a half hour.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'll be ready in 20 minutes.
          Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it
          down on the plate.   She goes to her suitcase and looks for
          clothes.   A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          These are really good.
          She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY
</b>
          Richard and Margaret board the yacht.   They wear athletic clothes
          and running shoes.

<b>          EXT. BOAT - DAY
</b>
          Richard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON SEAFOODS PIER - DAY
</b>
          Richard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier.   Located in
          the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large
          warehouses, and buzzes with activity.   Fishing boats line the
          pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be
          processed.   Everything is clean and organized.
          Richard and Margaret walk down the pier.   He points to the SEALS
          that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps.   Damn, they're cute.
          Richard waves hello to WORKERS.   An elderly Phillipino man, BEK
          BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse.

<b>          BEK BEK
</b>          Hey, Richard!   That the lucky lady?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yes sir, it is!

<b>          BEK BEK
</b>          (to Margaret)
          You look much younger than everyone says.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          That's great to hear.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          See ya on the line, Bek Bek.

<b>          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Richard opens a locker and points.   We don't see at what.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Put this on.   I'll meet you outside.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          But I don't...

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Ah.   Put it on.

<b>          EXT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Margaret opens the door with a sour look on her face.   She's
          wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing
          boots, and gloves.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Is this really necessary?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You'll thank me later.
          Richard walks towards the warehouse.   Margaret follows in her

</b>
<b>          INT. SLIME LINE - DAY
</b>
          Inside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different
          stations process the fish that come off the boats.
          At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head
          decapitator machine.   He happily feeds whole salmon into a
          guillotine, where the heads are chopped off.   He awkwardly waves
          when he sees Margaret and Richard.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Why is he handcuffed to the machine?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          So his hands don't go too far.   So he
          doesn't...
          Richard makes a chopping motion.   Margaret winces.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Nice.
          From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where
          their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a
          vegetarian for six months in college.
          Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long
          line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are
          frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller
          line and clean out all the left over intestines.

<b>          WORKER
</b>          There he is!   Big city boy come to show us
          how its done.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Ah, it's been a while.

<b>          WORKER
</b>          C'mon.   Show her how we do it.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Okay, okay.
          Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line.   Richard expertly
          demonstrates with a knife.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you
          don't want to bruise it.   Open her up, tilt
          the knife, and then pull with the grain of
          the fish.   Two quick stokes to clear the
          organs attached to the spine.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>          64.
</b>          Margaret looks nauseous.   Richard enjoys her discomfort.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the
          blood out of the vein.   Then send her down
          the line.
          Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before
          offering a knife to Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Wanna try it?
          Margaret doesn't say anything.   All the other workers watch.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          If it's too gross for you...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Gimme that.
          Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish.
          Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible
          between her and the salmon.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I did this for five summers.   Dad wanted me
          to earn my stripes before I took over.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Is that why you're still pissed at him?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Nah, I loved it here.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (re: fish guts)
          You loved this?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          The slime line?   Hell no.   Nobody loves the
          slime line.   I loved this place.   The
          people.   Growing up, running this place was
          all I wanted.
          Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (DISGUSTED)
</b>          You wanted this?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I wanted to run this place. It was
          comfortable here.   It was what I knew.
          (re: fish)
          Don't forget the spine.

<b>          65.
</b>
<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I wasn't gonna forget.
          Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on
          its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          But then things changed.   And it wasn't so
          comfortable anymore.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What kind of things changed?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Stuff.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (as if she didn't know)
          You mean, like, Gertrude?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yeah...
          Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Oh my god.   She told you didn't she?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (INNOCENT)
</b>          Told me what?
          Richard is embarrassed.   He turns away.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          About the... you know.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          The creepy teenage proposal?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Ah, shit!

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You were a freak by the way.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          OK, get it all out.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          And she was right to break up with you.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You done?
          Margaret nods yes.

<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          66.
</b>          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I know now that it was the right thing, but
          it screwed me up for a little while.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          For a little while?   Don't sell yourself
          short.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          When Gert crushed my heart into little
          pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great
          anymore.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          So you moved to the open arms of New York
          City?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          At first it was about getting as far away
          from this place as possible, but then I fell
          in love with it.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          With scheduling my pilates?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          With editing.   See, as an only kid I'd
          always read a lot, but until I worked for
          you I didn't love it.   I mean, when I
          realized that we could find the next
          Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (with reverence)
          ...To Kill a Mockingbird.   It's all about To
          Kill a Mockingbird.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Exactly!   We could find the next To Kill a
          Mockingbird.   God damn, how great is that?
          Margaret smiles.   She never knew that Richard had this kind of
          passion for the job.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          So when I tell my folks that I want to spend
          my life finding books?   My dad goes ape
          shit.                                                             "How dare you forsake your family...
          you'll come crawling back to us... you're
          nothing without our help."   I left that
          night and we didn't talk for a year.
          Haven't been back here since.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          So we're "getting married" so you can give

          Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Sorta.   OK, Yes.   Coming back here with
          you...   I get the promotion and I get to
          show off.   You're editor in chief.   You make
          a good prop.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (SMILING)
</b>          I guess that's a compliment.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          So now you know I'm a petty asshole.   Am I
          trustworthy again?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Oh yeah, we're good.   By the way, you're
          more screwed up than I am, Paxton.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yeah.   Thanks.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          One more question...

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a
          lesbian.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          That wasn't my question.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I know.   Just lashing out.
          Margaret smiles.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Can we stop gutting fish?   I need my phone.

<b>          INT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret enter the well appointed general store,
          filled with food, booze and electronics.   A mini Wal Mart.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Hey Ramone.

<b>          RAMONE
</b>          Hey Richard.   Hola mi amo.
          Margaret recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night.

</b>          Hey.
          They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You know him?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          He was my shop teacher.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Of course he was.   How many people are on
          this island?
          They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Like eight thousand?   Depends on the time of
          the year.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Feels smaller.
          With the cart full they head to the checkout.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (to Ramone)
          You got the phone I called about?

<b>          RAMONE
</b>          Charged up, ready to go, number changed.
          Ramone throws Richard a phone.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Thanks, Ramone.

<b>          RAMONE
</b>          No problem.
          Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave.   She awkwardly waves back.
          Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay.
          Margaret is confused.

<b>          EXT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Richard keeps pushing the cart, Margaret catches up.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          It's our stuff.

</b>          Richard points to the "Paxton General Store" sign.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          That must have been handy in High School.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You have no idea.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Should you leave the cart?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          It's our cart.   I didn't know you were such
          a prude.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I've come to realize that being my assistant
          gave you more access to my life than I ever
          imagined, but there are a few things you
          don't know about me.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I doubt it.   When I started, you were still
          wearing those Ugg boot things.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (deadly serious)
          I told you never to talk about that.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I'm just saying it's been a long time.   I
          know it all.
          Margaret turns on her new phone.   It searches for a signal.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (up to the challenge)
          Did you know I took disco lessons in the
          sixth grade?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Where?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          What'd they sing again?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You know.

<b>          (SINGING)
</b>          Cherish the love we have, we should cherish

          Richard shakes his head.

          Well they were good.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You had a lot of soul there, Canada.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I really like "The O.C.".   Not fake, ha, ha
          isn't it funny I like this trash.   I really
          like it.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Wow.   I'm getting shut out here.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Allergic to pine nuts.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Knew that.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Afraid of penguins.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Huh.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Haven't slept with a man in a year and a
          half.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Holy shit!   You are a lesbian!
          A MOTHER walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty
          look.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (to mother)
          My bad.
          The mother walks on.   Margaret is mortified and walks faster.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          That's a really long time.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I knew it had been slow going, but I figured
          there was a booty call in there somewhere.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yeah, well, I'm not good at that.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I find that hard to believe.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          No, not that.   I'm great at that.   Aces.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I'll have to take your word for it.

</b>          Yes.   You will.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          How, exactly, do you define top notch?
          Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone.   In
          an instant, she's all business.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I need a computer and the internet.   Now.

<b>          INT. FISHERMAN'S NET INTERNET CAFE - DAY

          Designed to attract tourists, the Fisherman's Net is awash in bad
          nautical props and fishing gear.   A bored TEENAGE CLERK in a

<b>          PIRATE

          explaining why he should stay with a
          publishing house that "makes" him do

</b>          Look lady.   You gonna put your name down on

          Margaret is about to throttle the Pirate, when Richard pulls her
          back.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          C'mon.   I got an idea.
          Richard leads Margaret to the door.   As they are leaving Margaret
          shouts out.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I didn't know there were a lot of pirates in

<b>          MRS. WHITING
</b>          I'm so excited about the wedding!

</b>          No problem.

          So what flowers are you going with?
          Margaret turns around annoyed, but manages to keep her cool.

</b>          Show me around will you Mrs. Whiting?   It's

          Richard and Mrs. Whiting walk around the elementary school.

<b>          MRS. WHITING
</b>          Do you think she'll be long?   I've got work
          to do.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          She'll be out of there in two shakes.
          Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a
          class of second graders.   He stops transfixed.

<b>          MRS. WHITING
</b>          (re: Gertrude)
          We are so lucky to have her.   Mr. Megher
          really left us shorthanded when he ran off
          in the middle of the school year.   He's
          living out in the forest now with his
          wolves.   Full time.
          Richard hasn't heard anything that Mrs. Whiting has said.   He's
          hypnotized by Gertrude.   She looks happy teaching these kids, and
          they hang on her every word.
          MRS. WHITING (cont'd)
          Will you excuse me?   The bell is about to
          ring, I need to get ready for recess.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (not paying attention)
          Uh, sure.
          Mrs. Whiting leaves.   Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees
          him.   Good lord can that woman smile.   She waves him in.

<b>          INSIDE THE CLASSROOM
</b>          The kids all turn to see Richard when he opens the door.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Class, this is my old friend Richard.

<b>          CHILD #1
</b>          Mr. Megher smelled like farty eggs!
          The class giggles.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick.
          The BELL RINGS.   One girl gets up.   Gertrude eyeballs her.

          Marcia?

<b>          CHILD #2
</b>          Sorry.
          The child sits back down.   Gertrude waits a beat.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          OK, everyone is excused for recess.
          All the kids pop up and head to the door.   Mrs. Whiting directs
          traffic outside.   Richard makes his way to Gertrude.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Patrick's right.   He did smell like eggs.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          It's still not a nice thing to say.   And
          actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog
          and...

</b>          What?   You loved my Top Gun.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          No.   You loved your Top Gun.   I just smiled
          and laughed like a good girlfriend.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          That's right.   Ice... man.   I am dangerous.
          Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise.

          What is it?   You know I hate it when you get

<b>          RICHARD
</b>
<b>          (RHETORICAL)
</b>          My wedding day isn't the best time for you
          to bring up the idea of us dating?
          Richard's reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up.
          Bringing this up is very hard for her.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          I'm not talking about dating!   You should
          move back here.   We can have the life you
          always talked about in High School.   I'm
          ready for that now.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Why are you doing this?

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          I know that the timing here sucks.   But we
          are meant to be together.   I know it.   I
          think you know it too...

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          No, I don't.   I don't know it.
          Richard begins to pace.   Not sure what to say.   Every time he
          opens his mouth, he can't find the words.
          Then, from the door, an interruption.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Hey guys.
          Holy shit.   Did Margaret hear anything?   Her face gives nothing
          away.   Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but
          look guilty as hell.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Oh.   Hey Margaret.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Uh, you all done?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yeah.   We'll see what he says.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Great.   Great.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You ready to get back to the house?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Uh.   Yeah.   Uh-huh.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Well let's go.   See you at the wedding,
          Gertrude.
          Gertrude just smiles.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Yeah.   See you at the wedding.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY
</b>
          Richard and Margaret unload champagne.   Richard is still thinking
          about Gertrude and wanting to be alone.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          So, what did you and Gertrude talk about?
          Richard lies.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Nothing.   About her school.   The kids and
          stuff.   Apparently my second grade teacher
          was a pot head.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          That was it?   I was gone for awhile...

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (cuts her off)
          Yeah.   That was it.   You know, I can do
          this.   You should really go try on the dress
          for my mom.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I was going to go for a run first, it's been
          three days since I got out, I'm feeling
          crazy.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (could care less)
          Whatever.
          Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but
          doesn't push it.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON TRAIL - DAY
</b>
          Margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods.   She's running
          hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's
          accumulated over the last thirty six hours.   She's lost in her
          own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What now?
          Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She
          soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN
          dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a
          carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as
          he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song
          that sounds centuries old.

<b>          SHAMAN
</b>          Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik
          pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani
          takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm.
          Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance.
          He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs.
          Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath.   He yells out again.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Margaret, welcome!
          She looks around.   Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Come to me, Margaret of New York.
          Nope, that's her.   She carefully steps out into the clearing.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          It is I, father Paxton.
          Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What, ah, are you doing?

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and
          clear my head.   As you know, things have
          been a little crazy around here.   You should
          join me.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Ya know, I've got to get back.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          You closed minded southerners amuse me.

</b>
<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm a big fan of the nest.
          Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Dance with me!   You besmirch my ways if you
          deny my circle.
          Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          OK, OK.   I "accept your circle."
          Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Clear your mind and follow me.
          Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.   Margaret
          follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.   After
          a few moments, Margaret stops.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm gonna head back.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          We're not done.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I think I am.
          Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Margaret?
          Margaret stops and turns around.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.   But
          I'm making an effort here.   Don't leave now.
          Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.   Geoffrey is pleased.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Thank you.
          (switching gears)
          Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik

          Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and
          speeds up the dance.   Margaret is getting better, but it is still
          painfully awkward.

</b>          Me what?

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Close your eyes.   Chant.
          Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.   Margaret closes her eyes,
          but can't figure out what to say.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Chant!

          ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...

          More sand.   More fire.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to sweat drop down my balls...
          Geoffrey stops dancing.   What did she say?
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to all these bitches crawl...
          Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken
          out into a â€˜Lil John song.   She continues to dance.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...To all skee skee motherfucker...
          Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Geoffrey!
          Margaret stops chanting â€˜Lil John.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Oh Debbie, I didn't do anything.
          Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Is she singing about balls?

<b>          MARGARET

          better.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned
          up.   You've got a dress to try on.   And
          Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and
          help us with this wedding.
          Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and
          the drum beat stops.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Fine.
          With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end.

<b>          INT. PAXTON MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
          Debbie and Annie wait outside a bathroom door in a massive master
          bedroom.   They talk to Margaret through the door.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          I am so excited.   Aren't you excited?

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          This was my dress from 1929.   My mother made
          it by hand.   Amazing how things come back
          into style.   How does it fit?
          Margaret speaks through the door.

<b>          MARGARET (O.S.)
</b>          Just buttoning up here.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Drum roll!
          Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds.
          Margaret opens the door and smiles.   She's unsure of herself, but
          looks fantastic.   The dress fits great, except...
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yeah, it's a little snug.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          Come over here.

<b>          (ADMITTING)
</b>          It's a lovely dress.
          Debbie looks at Margaret, and spontaneously begins crying.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          (through the tears)
          You're so beautiful, and such a great match
          for my Richard.   I know I've just met you,
          but a mother can tell.   When he looks at
          you, I can tell he's in love.   I'm so happy
          I get to share your day.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Debbie, please.   We've got work to do.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          You're right.
          Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          You go work downstairs, I'll finish this.
          Debbie tries to calm down, but can't.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Go!
          Debbie nods in agreement.   Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in
          tears.   Margaret and Annie watch her go.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Had to get rid of her before I gave you
          this.   Don't think she woulda recovered.
          Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around
          Margaret's neck.   When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays
          on Margaret's neck.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          You needed something blue.   It's silly, but
          I didn't want to take any chances.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          It's beautiful.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          It's hematite.   Alaska diamonds.   The blue
          ones like this are very rare.   My great
          grandfather gave it to my great grandmother
          when they were married.   They were quite a
          scandal, you know.   He was Russian and she
          was Tlingit.

          Back then, you had to get approval from
          every person in the tribe before you got
          married.   It almost broke them up.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          How'd they stay together?

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Don't know.   But I'm sure happy they did,
          none of us would be here if they hadn't.
          Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          I want you to have it.
          This is awful news for Margaret.   She might as well be stealing
          from Annie.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          No, no, no.   I can't.   Really.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          I don't want to hear it.   It's yours.
          Grandmothers like to give their stuff away
          to their grandchildren.   Makes us feel like
          we'll always be a part of your life, even
          after we're gone. Take it.
          Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time
          feels like a complete and total fraud.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Are you feeling all right, dear?
          Margaret doesn't speak.   Annie patiently waits for her reply.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Well.   Thing is...
          Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...the dress is just a little tight.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these
          seams by the arm, this'll be easy.
          Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          We can fix this no problem.

</b>          As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees,
          blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the
          coastline have a calming effect on both of them.   In Alaska, it
          doesn't take long to leave humanity behind.
          Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep
          mountain walls on either side.   Although it is still warm out, an
          icy beach can be seen straight ahead.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Where are we?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          The north pole.   Congratulations, we made
          it.
          (off Margaret's look)
          It's a glacier.   Tracy's Arm.   You better
          let me take it from here.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm fine.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Oh.   OK.   So like me, you've navigated a lot
          of glacier fields?   And not died?
          Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Lady, you've got issues.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          It doesn't stop there.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          This coming from the sociopath.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Oh, please.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'd never bring me here.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You drove!

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I mean to Alaska.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Are you kidding me?
          Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You're sick.   Doing this to them.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I explained to you...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          They love you.   Do you get that?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Of course.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          And you're still willing to lie to them?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Like you didn't know.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Didn't know what?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          That we were going to lie to them.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I didn't know!

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Well that makes you either stupid, or
          ignorant.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You think I'm stupid?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          No, but what's behind door number two...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (SCREAMS)
</b>          I forgot!   OK?   I forgot!

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Forgot what?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What it was like!

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          What what was like?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          To have a family!   I forgot what it was like
          to have a family.   I've been on my own since
          I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was
          like to have people that love you, and make
          you breakfast, and give you necklaces...

<b>          89.
</b>          Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of
          breath.   She goes to the side of the speed boat.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to take a walk.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          We need to head back...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Alone.   I need alone time.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          What?
          Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm, uh, about to lose my shit.   Big time.
          I need a second.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          But...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (PANICKED)
</b>          Stop right there!
          Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to be over there.   Away from you.
          Just sit down, turn around, and act like
          you're not here.
          Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down
          and turn around.   He does.   Margaret gets off the boat and walks
          away from him on the glacier.

<b>          ON THE GLACIER
</b>          Margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (manic, to herself)
          You can do this.   Couple more hours, and
          then you'll never see these people again.
          Eventually you'll write a letter.
          Apologize.   Send the necklace back.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (from the boat)
          Margaret!

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          No talking!

</b>
<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (from the boat)
          Watch your step, OK?   It can be dangerous.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Again, you're not supposed to be...
          Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.

<b>          ON THE BOAT
</b>          Richard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her
          reply.   He doesn't hear anything.   That's weird.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (back still turned)
          Margaret?
          Richard turns around and looks for Margaret.   He doesn't see her.
          He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the
          direction he last saw Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Margaret?   I know I'm breaking "the rules"
          here, but where are you?
          He takes one more step before he hears...

<b>          MARGARET (O.S.)
</b>
<b>          (YELLING)
</b>          Richard!!!!!!!!   Help!!!!!!!!
          Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her
          voice.   He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that --
          Margaret's been swallowed by the ice.   Her upper torso sticks out
          of the glacier, held up by her arms.   Her eyes are wide, and
          she's almost hyperventilating.     It's a bizarre sight.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh, thank God!
          Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.
          Margaret is really scared.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   Just relax.   I'll
          get you out of there.   You've broken through
          an ice bridge.   It happens all the time.   No
          biggie.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Don't do that.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          91.
</b>
<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Don't do what?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they
          tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to
          death that they're going to be OK.   Don't do
          that!

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          It's not like that.   Really.   We do need to
          be careful here though, I don't want us both
          to fall in.   Stay still, OK?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Uh-huh.
          Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the
          ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          So, I'm going to walk up to you and very
          slowly pull you out.   OK?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm really cold.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded
          by ice.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (makes sense)

<b>          OK.
</b>          Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to
          his knee.   He calmly looks down on her.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits.
          I'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't
          freak out.
          Margaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly
          lifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          When I get you all the way out, I need you
          to hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you
          over there.
          Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's
          strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her "over
          the threshold" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks
          once they're safe.

<b>

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          92.
</b>          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I've, uh, never done that before.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          You said it was "no biggie".

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yeah.   Well.   You OK?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yeah.   I'm fine.
          Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back.
          Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits
          just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

<b>          (SMILING)
</b>          You shouldn't of laughed at me.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You woulda laughed at me.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yeah.   While I was getting my camera.
          The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark.
          They might kiss.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Gertrude wants me back.
          Whoah.   Not what she was expecting.   She looks down.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          And?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Well.   It seemed like you were having...
          second thoughts.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yeah.   I was.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Maybe we should do it.   Come clean.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Put me down.
          Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain
          her composure.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You wanna call it off?

<b>

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          If you do.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Fine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we
          get back.

<b>          ON THE BOAT
</b>          Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.
          Richard drives the boat.   They don't talk.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
</b>
          Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above
          them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting
          married.   The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a
          hurry.   He's clearly been waiting.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Come with me.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Where's mom, dad?   We all need to talk.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Not now.   C'mon.
          Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.
          Geoffrey storms off and they follow.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON GUESTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
          Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the
          guesthouse.   Geoffrey stops before they go in.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          (to Richard)
          I haven't told your mother about any of
          this, and I don't plan to.
          (to Margaret)
          I was really beginning to like you.   Sorry
          about this.
          Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.

<b>          INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE
</b>          The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court.   In the
          middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding
          chair.   It's Gilbertson.   He smiles.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Hey there kids.   Good to see ya!

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (to Dad)
          What did you do?
          Geoffrey doesn't answer.   He's not proud of himself.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (getting angry)
          What did you do, dad?!

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          I called him yesterday.   He told me that you
          were lying, and that he was going to catch
          you.   That he was going to send you to
          prison.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          (to Richard)
          We made a deal and dad here flew me up.   Now
          you tell the truth, and get off scott free.
          It's like it never happened for you.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You made a deal with him?   On my behalf?

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          You were making a mistake...

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          That's none of your business.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          It's fine.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          The hell it is.   It is not fine!

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Oh quack, quack, quack.   Just tell me what
          really happened, and I'll be on my way.   No
          one gets hurt, we all get what we want.
          Margaret takes Richard's hand.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          It's OK.   Tell him.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          (to Geoffrey)
          You do not get to make this decision.   This
          is my decision.
          (to Gilbertson)
          The truth is... I've been working for
          Margaret for three years.   Six months ago we
          started dating.   I recently asked her to
          marry me, and she said yes.   See you both at

          Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          The couple walks briskly to the house.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          What was I thinking?   They act like they're
          nice, but really, they're evil.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          He's only doing it because he loves you.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Are you defending him?   Are you defending
          the king dick?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Just stop.   Think about this.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Oh, I've thought about it.   And know what I
          think?   I think you saved my life.   Thank
          you, Margaret.   Getting married to you is
          the best thing that's ever happened to me.
          Without this, I might've ended up back here.
          Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          There you are!   You two almost gave me a
          heart attack.   C'mon, get dressed!

</b>          Coming mom!

          Time to sack up.
          Richard winks and goes inside.   Margaret follows, not sure.

<b>          THE WEDDING MONTAGE
</b>          -- Chairs are set up outside.
          -- Guests arrive via boat.
          -- Richard stands on the deck, wearing his tuxedo.   Gertrude
          arrives for the wedding, and they lock eyes.   Richard waves hello
          and mouths "Sorry."   He goes back inside.

          for the wedding yet.   Debbie shakes her head at him in the mirror
          as she puts on her ear rings.
          -- Gilbertson eats every hors d'oeuvre that's offered to him.

<b>          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Grandma knocks on the door and comes inside.   We see Margaret
          from head to toe.   The dress, veil and flowers look amazing.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is
          perfect.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Matches the shoes.
          Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Those'll be your best friend.   Wedding shoes
          stink.   You ready?

<b>          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
</b>
          With the ocean in the background, 200 GUESTS sit in white chairs.
          Richard stands under a gazebo, and smiles at his mother in the
          front row.   He ignores Geoffrey.
          Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson.
          From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who
          begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads "Kool and
          the Gang, Cherish".   Heads turn with the start of the music, to
          see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle.
          When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.

          Nice song.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          Is that your song, dear?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I guess so.
          Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle.   Looking up,
          Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.                      (Yes, the same
          guy from the liquor store and the strip club.)

</b>
<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          It's me, Ramone.
          Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard.   They
          whisper while they walk up to Ramone.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You look gorgeous.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>
<b>          (SMILING)
</b>          You look disgusting.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          So, is this what you dreamed of when you
          were a little girl?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Oh, you bet.
          They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Ramone.

<b>          RAMONE
</b>
<b>          (QUIETLY)
</b>          Mi amo.
          (To the crowd)
          We are gathered here today to celebrate one
          of life's greatest moments.   To give
          recognition to the beauty, honesty, and
          unselfish ways...
          Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's
          looking straight ahead, determined to get through this.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...of Richard and Margaret's true love...
          "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the
          audience notices.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...before their family and friends.
          "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and
          Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in
          order to keep himself seated.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          For it is family and friends who taught
          Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only
          right that family and friends all celebrate
          that love here today.

<b>          98.
</b>          RAMONE (cont'd)
          And if there is anyone who has cause why
          this couple should not be united in marriage
          and love, they must speak now or forever
          hold their peace.
          Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask.
          Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention.
          He's not sure what to do.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          Mi amo, do you have a question?
          We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted
          shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          No.

<b>          RAMONE
</b>          Then why is your hand up?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I have something to say.   It's not a
          question though.

<b>          RAMONE
</b>          Can it wait â€˜til after?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Uh.   Um.   No.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          What are you doing?
          Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.     They
          stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Hey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out.
          I've got a little announcement to make about
          the "wedding."

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Don't do this.
          Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Not sure the best way to tell you all this.
          But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is
          all a sham.
          Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          99.
</b>          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I was going to get kicked out of the country
          -- so I told Richard that I would destroy
          his career if he didn't marry me.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Now wait...

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Richard.   Please.   Let me finish.
          (to the Paxton family)
          Richard wanted to stop this when we got off
          the plane, but I wouldn't let him.   Don't
          blame him.   This is all my fault.
          (to Ramone)
          Could you get the band started?   And give
          these people something to drink.
          (to Gilbertson)
          And you.   Meet me at your dingy in ten,
          you're taking me to the airport.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          You got it!
          Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks
          back up the aisle with all eyes on her.   She stops when she gets
          to Gertrude and leans down.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Take care of him.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Promise.
          Margaret walks back into the house.   Alone.

<b>          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Margaret's wedding dress is laid out on the bed.   Her bag is
          packed.   Richard knocks and comes in.   Margaret is on the phone.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          (unenthusiastically to phone)
          Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good
          news.   Talk to you on Monday.
          Margaret hangs up.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          So Frank's back in?
          Margaret nods distractedly.   Getting Frank to do the publicity
          tour doesn't mean much right now.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yup.   He's in.   For now.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yeah.   Right.
          Margaret starts collecting her bags.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Great exit back there.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Thanks.   Fun weekend.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Same old, same old, around here.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to
          strip the sheets, so I just left them.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I'll let her know.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          Why did you tell them all that?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          It was getting too messy.   We weren't going
          to be able to keep it up.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Don't start lying to me now.
          Margaret stops for a moment.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I heard you and Gertrude at the school.   I
          think she meant what she said.   She's a
          great girl, you should stay.   It's the right
          thing.   You're perfect for each other.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          But... but what about you?   What are you
          gonna do?
          Margaret wants to keep the conversation short.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Don't worry about me.   I'll survive.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          So what?   This is it?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yup.   This is it.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          101.
</b>          Margaret walks to the door, but stops.   She turns to Richard.
          Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

<b>          (SINCERE)
</b>          Have an amazing life, OK?   You're a good
          person.   You deserve it.
          She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it.   It's electric, but
          Margaret denies it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Goodbye, Richard.

<b>          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
</b>
          Margaret walks down to the dock carrying her suitcase.   She can
          hear that the party is in full swing and smiles.

<b>          EXT. BOAT - DAY
</b>
          Gilbertson drives his little speedboat and Margaret holds her
          suitcase tight.   It's choppy, and the outboard motor is loud.
          The two have to yell to talk.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          I want you to say the words.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm not doing great in the dignity
          department, can we not do this right now?

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Say it.
          Margaret closes her eyes.   Hating that it's come to this.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'll publish your book.
          Gilbertson smiles.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Now was that so hard?

<b>          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY
</b>
          Richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore.
          Gertrude walks up to him, looking fabulous, with two more beers.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          So here's the deal.   I'm going to have a
          million questions for you tomorrow...
          Gertrude sits down next to Richard.

<b>

</b>          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          ...but for now I thought we'd just sit here
          and drink beer.   OK?
          Richard nods.   Gertrude hands him a beer.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Thanks.
          Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek.   Then, realizing
          where and who he is with, he puts his beer down.   He turns to
          Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the
          lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss.
          When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed.
          Richard looks worried.   Something is wrong.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          You have been practicing.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Waddya mean?

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Well.   Margaret told me that you, uh, turned
          into bit of a man whore down there.
          Richard looks down.   A bit ashamed.   Gertrude makes light.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          You're gonna have to put that in check if
          you move back.   Cause me and Beth Cable are
          the only two real options up here... and
          I'll kick that bitch's ass.
          Richard gives her a polite smile.   He's not really in the mood to
          joke.   Gertrude notices.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          So no jokes yet?   Too soon?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I'm sorry.   I'm just a little... confused.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          That kiss didn't seem "confused."
          Richard takes a beat to collect himself.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You're amazing, Gert.   And I've thought
          about being with you for a long time.   A
          long time.   When you said those things at
          the school?   I've dreamed about hearing you
          say those things.

          But as crazy as this seems.   I know now...
          that we're just not meant to be.
          Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret?
          I felt sick.   For the three years we worked
          together, I wanted to be as far away from
          her as possible.   But now that she's gone?
          I'm just really... sad.   I want her with me.
          What is that?
          The question hangs in the air.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          I don't know.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I think I have to find out.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Find out what?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          If she feels the same way.
          Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry.

<b>          GERTRUDE
</b>          Well.   OK then.   What's a girl gonna do?
          (voice cracking)
          I guess you want who you want.
          Gertrude gives a melancholy smile.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I'm so sorry.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          But, I gotta go.

          Debbie, Geoffrey and Annie sit at a table next to the bar,
          dumbstruck looks on their faces.   Ramone mixes drinks and flips
          bottles.   Richard runs up to them all, looking excited.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          She violated you.   We should report her.

</b>          Oh my God.   He's got the Stockholm syndrome.

</b>          I don't have the Stockholm syndrome.   And
          she didn't violate me.

<b>          DEBBIE
</b>          What is going on, Richard?
          Richard slows down and explains to his mom.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I'm sorry I lied to you.   That was an awful
          thing to do.   But it took this weekend for

          An oxygen mask covers Annie's face.   Geoffrey holds her hand.
          Annie motions for Geoffrey to come closer and he leans down.
          Geoffrey sits up and shouts over the helicopter noise.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Richard!   She has something she wants to say
          to us!
          Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie.   Their three
          heads are very close together.   Annie speaks to them both through
          the oxygen mask.

<b>          ANNIE
</b>          Listen to me.   You two need to stop
          fighting.   You'll never see eye to eye, but
          you're family.   If this doesn't stop, one
          day you'll regret it.
          (to Geoffrey)
          Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if
          you don't agree with him.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          I... I promise.

<b>          ANNIE
</b>          And Richard.   Promise you'll work harder to
          be a part of this family.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I promise, Grandma.

<b>          ANNIE
</b>          OK, then.
          Annie closes her eyes.   She looks peaceful.   A moment passes.

          ANNIE (cont'd)
          (as if nothing happened)
          I'm feeling much better.   I don't need to go
          to the hospital.   Take us to the airport,
          please.
          Richard and Geoffrey are confused.   Stunned even.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          What... what is going on?
          (so the Coast Guard can't hear)
          Did you fake a heart attack?

<b>          ANNIE
</b>          We didn't have time for your squabbling, and
          I knew a helicopter would be the quickest
          way to the airport.   It seemed like the best
          way.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          The best way?

<b>          ANNIE
</b>          And remember, you two promised me that
          you're going get along.   I wasn't kidding
          about that.

<b>          COAST GUARD PILOT
</b>          Ma'am, I'm not authorized to take you to the

          as they run to the control tower.

<b>          INT. AIRPORT TOWER - DAY

          CHUCK has an easy job.   Jets fly into Sitka, but there are only
          about six flights a day.   He is half awake as he radios
          Margaret's flight.   Reggae music plays in the background.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          Flight 1601, you're clear for takeoff.

          The PHONE RINGS in the tower.   Chuck picks up.   Intercut as

</b>          Tower.   Talk to me.

</b>          Hey Chuck, it's Richard.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          Hey man.   Heard about your lady bailing.
          How often does this happen to you?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Need you to do me a solid, brother.   I gotta

          The plane rattles as it gains speed for takeoff.   Margaret
          studies the safety pamphlet, trying to ignore Gilbertson.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          ...so next topic.   Celebrities.   Let's

          Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Well.   That's it.   Once she gets back to New
          York, it'll be like this never happened.
          Richard looks defeated.   Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and
          takes a deep breath.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          So, you know I think you shouldn't be with

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          You've made that crystal clear.

<b>          GEOFFREY
</b>          Good.
          (looks at Annie)
          Well, consider this me keeping my promise.
          Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button.   He waits
          for an answer.

</b>          ...you know those two hundred pages I took
          out?   I'm going to put them back...
          A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts.

<b>          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>          Ms. Mills?   Would you come with me?
          Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Yes, of course.
          She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat.

          There's someone on the radio for you.
          The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at
          the front of the plane, outside the cockpit.
          FLIGHT ATTENDANT (cont'd)
          Uh, a Richard Paxton?
          Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt.

          Richard and his family are huddled around the radio in the tower.
          Chuck sits nearby.

<b>          FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
</b>          (from radio)
          I'm sorry.   She won't come talk to you.

</b>          Shit!   She's never going to pick up...

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          (to Richard)
          Know what, home slice?   Cut this chica

          totally be into you...
          Suddenly, Richard has an idea.   He picks up the hand mic.

<b>          RICHARD

          DING!   The captain comes on over the loudspeaker.

<b>          CAPTAIN
</b>          (over plane loudspeaker)
          Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is
          your captain.   We've reached our cruising
          altitude of 30,000 feet.   Flight time'll   be
          three hours and thirty minutes.   And
          Margaret?   Richard has something he'd like

          The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's
          Margaret.   Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she
          doesn't know either.
          RICHARD (O.S.) (cont'd)
          (over loudspeaker)
          This certainly isn't how I wanted to do
          this.   I mean, I'm not really into the whole
          baring your soul in front of strangers
          thing, but I figure it's now or never.   So
          here goes.

          Richard puts down the hand mic for a second to gain composure.
          His family encourages him on.

<b>          CHUCK
</b>          You're doing great, man.
          Richard pushes the button down on the hand mike.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          I know you're used to being on your own.
          And that you're comfortable with your life
          the way it is.   And that in a million years
          you wouldn't have thought that we should be
          together.   I know, because I felt the exact
          same way.

          Every passenger is enraptured by the words coming out of the

<b>          RICHARD (O.S.)
</b>          (over loudspeaker)

          you're tired of being alone too.   So come

          The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.

<b>          HANDSOME MAN

<b>          MARGARET (O.S.)
</b>          (from radio)
          What the hell are you doing?
          Everyone in the tower smiles.   They're making progress.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          We need to talk.
          (Intercut as necessary.   Margaret stands at the front of the
          plane with the passengers watching.)

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          About what?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Have you ever thought there might be a
          reason we've been together for the last
          three years?

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          As boss and assistant.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Things change, Margaret.

<b>          MARGARET

<b>          (INCREDULOUS)

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Yeah, things change.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          Is that the best you got?
          Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say "see, that's what I said."
          Richard composes himself.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Now, tell me the truth.   When you left, were
          you relieved or sad that we didn't have an
          excuse to be together anymore?
          Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up.   That was a good one.

</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          What's your point?

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          Because I am sick that you left.   And if you
          feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be
          together?
          Margaret goes to answer, but stops.   Richard is right.   She wants
          to go back.   Even the passengers on the plane can see it.
          Gilbertson panics.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Are you thinking about going back to him?
          Margaret doesn't answer.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          We have a deal!   You can't back out now!
          The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying
          to break up Richard and Margaret.

<b>          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>          Sir, you need to sit down.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          I will do no such thing.

<b>          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>          Sir, I'm ordering you to return to your
          seat.
          Other passengers yell "sit down asshole" at Gilbertson.

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Who said that?

<b>          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
</b>          Sir, this is your third and final warning!

<b>          MR. GILBERTSON
</b>          Listen sweetheart...
          (he pokes the flight attendant)
          I'm a federal officer, so why don't you get

          BUZZ! ZAP!                                                            400,000 Volts of electricity surge through
          Gilbertson.   He twitches violently and crashes to the floor.
          Behind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge.

<b>          HANDSOME MAN
</b>          Well, I'm a federal Air Marshall.   And

</b>          The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around
          Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom.   He then
          takes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers.
          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)
          Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need
          to get this unruly passenger off the plane
          ASAP.   Sitka's the closest airport, so if
          it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain
          turn this bird around.
          There are wild cheers from the passengers.   Margaret blushes.
          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)

          Flight 1601 glides to a safe landing.   Richard and his family
          wait on the tarmac, and the plane taxis to them.   A truck drives
          stairs to the front door of the plane and the door opens.
          Margaret steps out.   Richard walks up the steps.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          This wasn't supposed to happen.
          Richard looks Margaret in the eye.

<b>          RICHARD
</b>          But it did.
          Margaret looks down.   A little embarrassed.

<b>          MARGARET
</b>          I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.
          Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and
          plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him.
          The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.

<b>          HANDSOME MAN
</b>          Uh, sorry, but excuse us.
          The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson
          down the steps.

          Hey!   Do you think getting arrested might

          Gilbertson makes a "go to hell" face and shuffles off.
          Margaret turns back to Richard.   All smiles.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          with him, he'll be happy.
          Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.

<b>          GRANDMA ANNIE
</b>          That's all we ever wanted.
          Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug.   Debbie joins
          in.   Then Geoffrey.   Passengers cheer.

          The party is in full swing.
          Balzac chases his balls.
          Ramone slides onstage and SINGS with the band.   He has a
          beautiful voice.
          Debbie and Geoffrey cut a rug.   They've done this before.

</b>          Gertrude and Annie chat and laugh at a nearby table.   The
          Handsome Man brings Gertrude a drink.   Grandma Annie winks and
          leaves these two alone.
          Margaret and Richard dance.   All smiles, even though they aren't
          very good.
          And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the
          island, to an eagle's nest at the very top.   Inside the nest,
          three eaglets chirp along to the music, snuggled up to Margaret's
          phone.
