          belt for six months, maybe a year...

</b>          What kind of belt?

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          A surgical belt. You won't be able to do
          very heavy lifting.

<b>                         FREDDIE
</b>          .I try to stay away from that.

<b>                         FREDDIE
</b>          I was on my way to Placerville. To the
          Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a
          friend of mine. He doesn't know where I
          am.

</b>          Who's that?

<b>                         FREDDIE
</b>          My Auntie Bertha, (she raised me.) But
          that doesn't mean I don't have a
          weakness...

</b>          College?

<b>                         FREDDIE
</b>          I tried that, it didn't work.

</b>          Sometimes my hypo's get the best of
          me, I really feel like walking into the
          street and hitting people's hats off.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          That's how you end up like this. With a

          the sea.. what kind of belt?

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          A medical belt. Similar for lifting.
          You're going to need some money. What do
          you plan to do?

<b>                         FREDDIE
</b>          I'm going to pay back the hospital. And
          you.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical
          duty. But you're expected to pay the
          hospital for medicines. And your belt.

<b>                         FREDDIE
</b>          Alright. I intend to do that. You saying
          you have a job for me? What? As an
          orderly?

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much
          lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have
          to learn. But maybe you could run an
          elevator, something of that sort.

<b>                         FREDDIE
</b>          I want to get out of here, but I also
          like it here. You think I was gonna die?

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          I know you were, Freddie.

<b>                         FREDDIE
</b>          I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't
          save me... . but...I can't seem to die.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          Too lucky?

          It's an old cattle TRAWLER that seems converted to some
          kind of CRUISE SHIP/PRIVATE YACHT-type vessel.
          There's a buzz of getting ready around the ship also a
          minor cocktail party in progress. (light music playing
          from the ship...) DECKHANDS preparing to ship out, etc...

          A SKETCH COMEDY SHOW, DANCING after-dinner. FREDDIE on
          the sidelines, watching it, not really understanding some
          of the humor and lyrics, etc...someone has a MOP on their
          head and is pretending to be a PSYCHOLOGIST with a vary
          thick/bad German-Austiran-accent. "zee muzzer and fazzer
          and zee penisss and ze nippelz.." attempting to cure a
          STUDENT... everyone LAUGHS.

          does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy
          little piece of tape is just nothin'
          without all the other equipment lined up
          properly, isn't it? We CAN access the
          past, traumas and seeds that abberate us
          in present time and once we access them -
          we challenge them and throw them away.
          Previously, I'd established how to access
          these aberrations and painful memories to
          pre-birth/cellular times.
          But the new studies prove there is a time
          beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which
          we are now working. At last count,
          perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our
          studies show...
          Besides the everyday struggles of how we
          become better, more able, more productive
          homo sapiens, the uses for this new
          science is the location and removal of
          certain leukemias, apathies, manics.
          Depressives, perverts, stuttering,
          neuroses, ulcers, arthritis, and asthmas.
          This is the province and science of
          Cause.
          If you'll forgive me, I must sit down.
          Perhaps you've taken notice of my leg
          injury and limp damndest thing. You see
          it happens every time I come to Manhattan
          Island, its a wound I've never conquered
          and I'll tell you how I found out about,
          because I never knew what in the H was
          happening...
          Well I did some processing to find out.
          Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me
          back...we processed over three hours! And
          something came up. It was this:
          I lived a life before and suffered a
          great injury. Knee injury...
          It was just around 1888. A great number
          and year. Significant as the creation .
          year of the new york city sewer system if
          I'm not wrong...
          I was a thief and criminal, working late
          into the night robbing a bank in the
          western side of the island.

</b>          The crime was committed with a revolver
          in hand. A Cole .45. My accomplices and I
          made it clear across town when we were
          ambushed by the local authorities.
          -- but I made a slip away. A digression
          into the under constructed sewer system.
          It was here that I could no be found - or
          so my thinking went. All my confidence
          and all my arrogance was brought upon me.
          Full in the face. For I was nose to nose
          with a twenty-five foot alligator in the
          New York City sewer. Oh brother! What a
          scare I was in for. Now if you've veer
          seen the SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR -
          you'll remember the fear.
          You see, this being an island, and in
          those days more inhabited by creature
          than man, why wouldn't I meet such a
          beast?
          In my evasion -- I dropped the gold. The
          money I'd stolen in my getaway.. .not
          dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented
          drain hole just around 125th
          Street... present day Harlem County I
          believe today. Yes. Yes.
          I stuffed it and made a getaway from both
          man and beast â€žshattered my knee in five
          different places-turned into a piece of
          glass..woke up early in the morning
          somewhere near the present day Times
          Square-which was nothing more than a
          farm..quite a farm..but that's another
          story.
          So what does this say? Injuries stay with
          us don't they??..They sure do. How's it
          gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna
          fix this knee. How are any of us going to
          get better? More able?
          We Must Process The Whole Of Time. This
          Life and Pre Natal Cellular processing is
          not enough. We have Lived Many, Many,
          Many Lives. So anybody tat is not
          processing the whole of time - is doing a
          disservice to man and Will Not Get
          Better. I cannot put it more simply.

          un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow

</b>          Yes. Well. They are very different. No.
          Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no,
          no. Don't associate us with such people!

          modern psychotherapy, does it not?

<b>                         MASTER
</b>          No it does not. This is an exact science,
          you see. Comparable to physics or
          chemistry - but simpler. It's
          engineering. Herr Freud had his chance
          and contributed some very workable data,
          but in the end, he failed. So that's
          that.

</b>          That depends. But it can be quite fast.
          Quite fast. Or it can take some time.
          Sometimes less than 36 hours.

<b>                         JOHN MORE

          no. But remember this: that religion has
          come uniformly from a philosophy.
          Philosophy is senior to religion. You

          rather narrow in its outlook?

<b>                         MASTER
</b>          No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's
          belief's, but religions in general can be
          pre-occupied with a God or Idol or
          something of some such nature who is
          merely trying to fill the universe with a
          lot of little replicas of himself - we
          are trying to free the individual - not
          bend to a will of a God, you see. And if
