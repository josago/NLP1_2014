    through a gray sky before being obliterated.

</b>    A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge
    of a boat and into the ocean.

</b>    UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are
    FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward.

    He breaks the surface and gasps for air.

    He begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the
    tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried
    beneath the dark ocean water.

    A floating tenement.
    A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water. The MAN swims
    into it. The net is RAISED as he lays, motionless, within its
    grip.

</b>    The crane swings around with the MAN in the net.

    He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish.

    AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over
    on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he
    DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a
    labored lobster-walk.

    He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge
    of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white
    and flaccid.

    A towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to
    him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of
    scotch and begins drinking.

    The same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle.

    He is dancing, holding on tightly to a WOMAN.

<b>                                                                2.

    Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven,
    with his hair neatly trimmed.

    Their connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing,
    overwhelmed with mutual desire.

    He holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all
    over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him.

    He kisses her passionately on the mouth.

<b>                        MAN
</b>              Oh, my dear...

    His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts. She
    begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around
    her ankles. Wearing only her tight corset she brings his
    hands to the laces and together they undo it.

<b>                        WOMAN
</b>                  (whispering softly)
              It's all right, darling. It's all
              right.

</b>              Oscar! Where the devil are you?

    Deftly, Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom.

</b>              My apologies, Mr. Roosevelt.

</b>    There with his bare legs, muscular and lean, sporting black
    socks held up with garters is FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, 39.

    He projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man
    who can have anything he wants.

    Right now... he wants his pants.

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              I've been standing here for five minutes.

    Oscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links and a
    Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs.

<b>                                                               3.

<b>                          OSCAR
</b>              Yes, sir.

    Franklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them,
    pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders.

</b><b>    INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
</b>
    Striding into the dining room, Franklin lifts a silver lid
    off a breakfast plate. He dismisses it and instead pours
    himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard.

    He overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room.

<b>                        WOMAN (O.S.)
</b>              I could not be more delighted to have
              received your most charming letter.
              It has been far too long since we last
              corresponded. However, it is with
              great reluctance I must decline your
              kind speaking invitation...

</b><b>    INT. SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
    ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, 34, is dictating a letter. Her enormous
    eyes, liquid and blue, reveal a woman of extraordinary
    intelligence and depth.

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>              Unfortunately, I would be of little
              assistance to the Junior Assistance
              League. Particularly if my purpose
              were to appear as an alumna who is
              gifted at public speaking.

    She is dictating to LUCY MERCER, 27, deeply feminine with a
    head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature. She is
    Eleanor's social secretary and closest friend.

    She is also the WOMAN dancing with Franklin the night before.

<b>                        LUCY
</b>              And what do you really want me to say?

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>              Thank you and if you ask again I
              shall scream?

<b>                                                          4.
</b>
They share a laugh -- which is not shared by the homely
rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          Why don't you ask your husband for
          some pointers? He's a pretty gifted
          public speaker, don't you think?

LOUIS HOWE, 48, is a wizened man of limited stature and
unlimited soul. Franklin's political advisor extraordinaire --
part consiglieri and part priest. He is the mastermind behind
what he believes will be the greatest political career of the
twentieth century.

He gets up and leans in closely to Eleanor. A cigarette dangles
off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          You should get out once in a while.
          Accepting that invitation would be
          good for Franklin's career.

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          Mr. Howe, wouldn't you be more
          comfortable waiting for my husband
          outside?

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          In the street, Mrs. Roosevelt?

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          If you like.

Eleanor smiles oh-so politely at Louis, as Franklin enters
from the dining room.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          I see it's not even eight a.m.
          and already the gloves are off.
              (kissing Eleanor on the
               cheek)
          Good morning, Babs. Hello, Miss
          Mercer.   L
<b>                     UCY
</b>          Good morning, sir.

Quickly, she lowers her eyes to her work.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>              (annoyed)
          You're late. Honestly, why do you
          enjoy keeping people waiting?

<b>                                                                5.
</b>
<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              Because they always seem more
              grateful to see me when I arrive.

    He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek.

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              Have a lovely day, Babs.

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>              Should I expect you for dinner?

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              I have the Navy reception this
              evening. I'll be home quite late.
              Unless you've changed your mind
              about coming?

    Louis looks up from his paper at Lucy who is writing
    furiously.

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>              Do you wish me to come?

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              Well... whatever you'd like.

<b>                        ELEANOR
</b>                  (a beat)
              Thank you, no.

<b>                        FRANKLIN
</b>              Very well then.
                  (tipping his hat)
              Good day, Miss Mercer.

    Lucy nods and Franklin exits. Then Louis tips his hat to the
    ladies and follows him out.

</b>    A car pulls over and Franklin is first out, followed by
    Louis, walking at a brisk pace as they cross the opposite
    side of the street. Louis struggles to keep up while
    consulting a small appointment book.

<b>                        LOUIS
</b>              At ten you've got a meeting with
              representatives from Pittsburgh
              Steel. Their bid on the ship
              building contract has already been
              turned in and is on your desk for
              approval.

</b>
<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          What did I think of it?

An AFRICAN-AMERICAN man steps off the curb, letting Franklin
and Louis pass.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          You had some problems with it.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          I better read it. Steel workers
          tend to vote democratic. Next.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          Lunch with Secretary Daniels.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          Must I?

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          He's your boss.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          Anything else?

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>              (a beat)
          What if she'd said yes?

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          Who?

Louis shoots him a look that says "you know who."

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          People know. It's time to stop.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          I can handle my own affairs, Louis.

<b>                    LOUIS
</b>          Not this one. This is Washington,
          D.C., not the Harvard Club.
              (off-put by Franklin's
               arrogance)
          How can you be so cavalier?

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          You say that like it's a bad thing.

Louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows
him inside a building.

<b>                                                                 7.

</b>     A large grandfather clock reads 3:00.

     The sound of a key in the front door turns and Franklin
     quietly enters. His hair is a mess and his clothing is
     slightly askew.

     As he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness.
     They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee, listening
     to the sound of Franklin's footsteps going up the stairs.

     Franklin goes into his bedroom. Eleanor quietly comes up the
     stairs and stops for a brief moment by Franklin's door, then
     goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her.

</b>     Franklin lays sleeping in his bed as Eleanor enters quietly
     so as not to wake him.

     Carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then
     turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an
     open duffle bag.

     Tentatively she reaches for them. She brings the packet, tied
     with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose. She is shocked by
     their familiar scent.

     With trembling hands she unties the ribbon. Tears flood down
     her cheeks as she reads.

     Franklin opens his eyes.

     playing a boisterous game of croquet.

     Franklin is at the opposite end of the table, looking pale.
     Louis, as always, is by his side.

     Eleanor, like a prisoner who has accepted her fate, sits
     across from them, calm and composed.

<b>                         ELEANOR
</b>               I have offered Franklin his freedom.

</b>               Falling in love is out of the

               families and their careers.

     Eleanor rises from the table.

     and attempts to light a cigarette, but his hands shake.

     the rest of his siblings. Elliot looks up at his father as

PHOTOGRAPHER follows them.

underprivileged children.

     Franklin steps into a line before a large communal water
     barrel and glances sideways at GUISEPPE, 9, an immigrant
     child of the city streets. He wears his uniform proudly and
     smiles at Franklin.

<b>                           GUISEPPE
</b>               Guiseppe.

     Franklin puts his arm around Guiseppe, forcing the moment
     between them. He waits patiently as the cameras click away.

     The SCOUTS begin washing their hands together in the water
     barrel and Franklin joins in as Louis looks on admiringly.

     As Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face, Franklin,
     not to be outdone, does so as well. It's all for the cameras.

     Eleanor sits quietly on the front porch knitting -- in a

     A few feet away -- also in a world of his own -- sits Louis,
     overdressed for summer in a three piece suit. An overflowing
     ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his
     feet.

     He holds up a paper to Eleanor with the photo of Franklin and
     the Boy Scouts.

Franklin and Elliot break out from the rest and begin racing
up the lawn. Franklin, no match for his son's speed, loses.

Franklin.

Utterly spent, Franklin lays on the grass, not moving.

Slowly, Franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Franklin in bed.

     This is all he stares at -- hour after hour after hour.

     His lips are dry.

     A glass of water sits tantalizingly on the night stand. He
     reaches for it but it's a few inches out of his reach.

     Slowly, he begins to rock his torso back and forth.

Franklin is slowly wheeled across the restaurant. He shrinks
from the stares of the patrons.

A LITTLE GIRL eating with her parents gets excited when she
sees Franklin's braces and points. Franklin gives her a hard
look and she is hurt.

What he can't see is that under the table she wears a set of
braces like his.

Franklin is wheeled up to his table and EUGENE and STANLEY sit
down with him.

Louis enters resembling a drowned rat. He rips off his hat
and raincoat and puts down his suitcase.

The Waitress puts down two cups of coffee. Franklin pulls out
a flask and pours some into his cup. He then lights a
cigarette and begins smoking, but doesn't offer one to Louis.
Without asking, Louis helps himself.

his briefcase and hands Franklin a stack of mail. Franklin
glances it, but doesn't open any.

</b>          There are a few from your children.

Franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that
interests him, opening it.

     shoulder of ROY COLLIER, African-American, 29. His brother
     PETE, 27, is close behind, carrying luggage -- both hover at
     around 6' 4".

     Tom approaches. Franklin attempts to hide his embarrassment
     with good cheer.

     Tom to shake.

     him inside. Pete follows.

     Pine trees tower over the sides of the dirt road. In

     "The Meriwether Inn" opened in his lap. He tries to spy the
     building through the trees but cannot.

     He looks back at the brochure. The picture is of a lavish
     Victorian Hotel and the words, "Our renowned mineral hot
     springs can cure whatever ails you!"

     Franklin looks up and sees a three-story hideous green and
     yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side. Paint is
     peeling everywhere. What once were flower beds are overgrown
     with weeds.

     The car pulls to a stop.

     Franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge, letting
     his feet dangle in the warm water.

     back the bad taste.

     For a long moment there is silence. Almost without realizing

          am having such a difficult time
          giving voice to my own thoughts
          here today.

The immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room.

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          I'm reminded of what someone once
          said about looking at an elephant.
          That it is impossible to ever see
          an entire elephant from one place --
          you must walk around it. If our
          elected leaders are to be truly
          effective then they must be willing
          to go out of their way to look
          beyond what is right in front of
          them. To see the entire elephant.
          And for that... they need our help.

The ladies applaud her, much to her relief. Louis beams.

     almost to himself.

     Sara sits at a piano between FRANKLIN, JR., 9, and JOHN, 7.

     Anna looks over at her father, sadly and Franklin catches her
     eye. She quickly looks away.

     From behind his back, John, pulls out the Christmas star and
     places it on his father's knee.

     Franklin tosses the star in an attempt to reach the top. It
     almost catches, but it falls to the floor.

     Quickly, aiding to avoid his father's embarrassment, James
     climbs back up and puts the star on top. Sara sensing the
     awkwardness of the moment begins to play and sing an overly
     cheery rendition of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."

               paying, some non-paying...

     As they get closer, Franklin is stunned by what he sees --

     A DOZEN PEOPLE -- all in different groupings -- some on
     crutches, others in wheelchairs, are gathered around the
     pool.

<b>                         FRANKLIN

     This news hits Franklin with the force of a sledgehammer.

     PAT DOYLE, 50, is stuffed into his wheelchair with a huge
     cigar between his fat lips.

      is eyebrows have a life of their own. He wheels himself to
     Franklin.

<b>                         PAT
</b>               Mr. Roosevelt, Pat Doyle. I've come
               all the way from Minneapolis to

     He reaches out his hand to Franklin.

<b>                         PAT
</b>               Stuck in this chair I do nothing
               but read. Newspapers, mostly.
               Usually I'm just looking for
               something -- anything -- that'll
               tell me there's even the slightest
               chance I'll walk again.

     Franklin is uncomfortable, especially as Pat won't let go of
     his hand.

<b>                         FRANKLIN
</b>               I really don't know what to say.

Franklin furiously wheels himself back towards the cottage,
getting stuck on the dirt path along the way.

Tom comes to his aid but he is brushed off by Franklin.

Franklin wheels himself off.

     Franklin sees someone else on the platform. He squints in the
     distance. It's Tom.

     He walks closer towards Franklin and Roy.

<b>                         TOM
</b>               Good evening.

     Franklin nods in Tom's general direction. Tom has a telegram
     in his hand which peaks Franklin's curiosity.

     onto the platform. A single ELDERLY WOMAN gets off the train.

</b>               Mother of God.

     Tom leaps up and into the car as does Roy leaving Franklin
     below. Tom takes his wrist.

     Roy lays Fred on a bench. Franklin wheels himself over.

<b>                         FRANKLIN
</b>               Son, can you hear me?

     Tom brings a cup of water. Franklin puts it to Fred's lips.

<b>                            FRANKLIN
</b>               Fred?

     Fred opens his eyes. They are large and brown with a
     sweetness to them. His face comes alive when he recognizes
     Franklin.

<b>                         FRED

     The headline reads: "FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY TO HEALTH!"

<b>                         FRED
</b>               The conductor wouldn't let me ride
               in the passenger car with my chair.

     Franklin looks at the clipping, then at Fred.

As Roy lifts Fred in his arms, Franklin wheels himself to the
engine car. Tom follows as they approach the CONDUCTOR.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          Who in their right mind let's a
          child ride in the baggage car!
          You could have killed that boy.

<b>                    CONDUCTOR
</b>          He had polio. Probably still
          contagious.

The Conductor walks away, dismissively. Franklin pushes his
chair up and stops the Conductor in his tracks.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          Don't dismiss me because I sit in
          this chair!

<b>                    CONDUCTOR
</b>          Get away from me.

Franklin pushes the wheels of his chair with such force he
knocks the Conductor over.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          You ignorant son of a bitch. If I
          could, I'd get up right now and

The Conductor struggles to get up.

</b>          Get this lunatic off me!

Franklin wheels himself towards Tom's car where Fred is now
lying across the back seat. The sight of Fred drains all
anger from Franklin's face.

          This is the start of the season,
          Franklin. I've got regulars who
          have come for years. Healthy folks

          polio.

<b>                    FRANKLIN

          no longer contagious?

<b>                    TOM
</b>          I'm going to have to ask that you
          not use the pool during regular
          hours. I'll put time aside for you
          late in the day... and it won't be
          possible for you to eat in the
          dining room either. But I promise
          I'll find someplace suitable.

<b>                    FRANKLIN

          That won't be necessary.

Franklin goes back to writing out the check. Tom stands
waiting, the sound of the pen scratching seemingly
interminable. Their mutual discomfort is obvious.

Franklin rips the check from the ledger and holds it for Tom.

     open.

Tom, struggling with a suitcase, comes down the ramp. He
deposits it in the trunk and then walks precariously back up
the ramp, having difficulty navigating the incline.

He goes back into the house for one last bag. When he comes
out, he's surprised by what he sees --

</b>          Where do you think you're going?

Franklin is being pushed by Roy in his wheelchair. They are
both dressed in pajamas and bathrobes, though Franklin has a
blanket around his shoulders to shield him from the morning
chill.

Tom is caught. This is everything he wanted to avoid.

<b>                    TOM
</b>          Going to Asheville to see my
          parents.

From the sight of Tom's car stuffed with luggage, it is clear
he is not coming back.

</b>          I can't do this without you...

                a beat)
          I've got cancer, Franklin. It's
          spread everywhere.

Franklin is stunned -- utterly thrown.

</b>          I... I'll take you to the best doctors.
          We'll go to Atlanta right now --

          you were in New York they opened me
          up for the second time. Now I just
          want to die in the bed I was born.

Franklin is struggling with this.

          This place has an identity now --

     Any guard Franklin had is gone. He reaches out and takes Tom
     by the sleeve slipping his hand into Tom's gripping it tightly.

     Tom takes one last look at Franklin.

<b>                         FRANKLIN
</b>               You never pitied me. Thank you for that.

</b>               I will miss you all the days of my

The BEEPING of a car horn gets their immediate attention.

Pete drives up in Tom's car. He parks it and steps out.

He begins showing off a system of pulleys and levers that
have been attached to both pedals. They thread through holes
in a second dashboard, attached to polished wood knobs.
It's a hand-controlled automobile.

      things out, almost manic in his energy.

</b>                A small schoolhouse will go there.
                We need it badly as many of the
                children are barred from the local
                schools due to their infirmities.

<b>                          FRANKLIN
</b>                We also require a blacksmith's shop
                so we can craft braces here on the
                premises. I've found a wonderful
                local man who can make crutches and
                canes. His work is outstanding. Of
                course what is most desperately
                needed is a hospital. That's going
                to put my fund raising abilities to
                the test.

      Franklin wheels himself up a ramp to the Inn as Eleanor and
      Louis follow.

                rehabilitation and treatment center
                in the world. My personal trust
                almost covers the price of the Inn

                will be a modest tuition charged to
                the patients which should hold us
                over while I seek out investors.

</b>              (furious)
          Practical? I am trapped inside a
          body that no longer moves of my own
          volition. I am trying to be
          practical. Now either you're with
          me or against me. In or out!

<b>                    ELEANOR

Eleanor starts to leave.

          back here.

She leaves.

</b>          You can't talk to her like that.

<b>                    FRANKLIN

                whether you want to run for office
                again.

      is stunned to observe over a dozen tables set up in the
      water.

      On each table is a child or an adult polio wearing their
      bathing suit. Next to them is a Physical Therapist also in
      bathing attire conducting therapy. In hushed tones the
      Physical Therapists encourage and work the distressed limbs
      of the patients as Helena swims to each table overseeing the
      work being done.

      legs in wheelchairs, shapely legs, flaccid legs, children's
      legs... some reveal illicit romances, betrayed by secret
      hand holding and hands on thighs.

      Jake and a new physical therapist, MARY BETH, are
      particularly cozy.

          hearts right now.
              (a beat)
          You're a man among men, Franklin.

<b>                       A WOMAN'S VOICE

          It's a real democracy at Warm
          Springs -- everybody gets heard!
              (to Franklin)
          You listening?

Eleanor, seated next to Franklin, watches as Franklin, in a
rare moment of emotional nakedness, is at a loss for words.

<b>                     JAKE
</b>          All right then, if I may do the
          honors of presenting to you the
          lovely Miss Eloise Hutchison of
          Cottage C.

Eloise wheels herself out. In a sweet, but untrained voice,
she begins the introduction to her song:

<b>                                                        81.
</b>
<b>                     ELOISE
</b>               (singing)
          "Think of what you're losing by
          constantly refusing to dance with me.
<b>          Y
</b>          Aou'd be the idol of France with me.
            nd yet you stand there
          And shake your foolish head dramatically,
<b>          W
</b>            hile I sit here so ecstatically.
          You just look and say emphatically:
          Not this season!
          There's a reason!"

Some members of the audience begin to smile, knowing what's
coming. Various STAFF step out from the kitchen to watch.

Eloise is joined by three others -- all of them in wheelchairs.

<b>                    ELOISE & CHORUS
</b>              (singing)
          "I won't dance! Don't ask me!
          I won't dance! Don't ask me;
          I won't dance, monsieur, with you."

Simple, but clever choreography utilizing the wheelchairs,
has the audience cheering.

<b>                    ELOISE & CHORUS
</b>          "My heart won't let my feet do
<b>                    C
</b>          things they should do."

<b>                     HORUS
</b>          "You know what? You're lovely."

<b>                    ELOISE
</b>          "And so what? I'm lovely."

<b>                    CHORUS
</b>          "But oh! What you do to me!
          I'm like an ocean wave that's
          bumped on the shore;
          I feel so absolutely stumped on the
          floor!"

This is too much for the crowd, including Franklin, Eleanor
and Louis. They laugh and cry in equal measure at the sight
of Eloise and her Chorus.

The song finished, Franklin quiets down the crowd.

<b>                                                                 82.

<b>                           FRANKLIN
</b>                 Before we say good night,
                 I understand our Royal-Taskmaster-
                 in-Residence, Miss Mahoney, insists
                 on having the last word.

      Helena rises from her seat.

<b>                           HELENA
</b>                 I don't think words describe
                 adequately what Daisy and I would
                 like to show all of you.
                     (calling out)
                 Are you ready, Daisy?

      Daisy's mother, Cecile, carries Daisy to the center of the
      room where Helena meets them. Helena bends down and removes
      Daisy's braces.

      The room is hushed.

      Daisy then begins to WALK tentatively towards her mother.

<b>      ON FRANKLIN
</b>
      Overwhelmed by what is taking place. He looks around and
      takes in the sight of so many different faces...

      Some are beaming, some are fighting back tears, some look
      away... the sight of it almost too painful... a reminder of
      their own private battles.

<b>      ON DAISY
</b>
      Only a step or two away from her mother she FALLS the short
      distance and lands in her mother's outstretched arms.

      WILD CHEERS go up in the room while Daisy's face glows with
      pride. She connects with Franklin, who matches her smile with
      his own -- genuine and beatific.

</b>      Roy lifts Franklin out of the wheelchair and on to the bed.

      Eleanor enters holding a lit candle.

      Roy is about to begin Franklin's bedtime routine, but Eleanor
      gently reaches out and touches him on the arm.

<b>                            ELEANOR
</b>                 Let me.

<b>                                                          83.

Roy looks to Franklin, who nods it's all right, and exits.
Eleanor closes the door and puts the candle on the bureau.

lies back on the bed.

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          What is your most pressing concern?

Eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down, slowly, so
as not to catch on the braces.

Eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the
back of a chair.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          Getting a doctor to live on the
          premises full-time. Someone who,
          at the very least, could monitor
          our progress. Make us legitimate.

She begins to take off Franklin's braces -- a series of
intricate buckles.

Eleanor slides the braces off his legs. His legs, though now
deeply tanned are withered and spindly. He is still wearing
his shoes.

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          And that costs more money.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          Yes.

Eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels
once again to untie his shoelaces.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          But the real problem is no one is
          interested. The annual Orthopedics
          Convention is being held in Atlanta
          this weekend and I offered to
          speak.
              (his anger surfacing)
          They turned me down flat.

Eleanor takes Franklin's pajama bottoms off the bed and with
tender care pulls them up his legs.

</b>          A few weeks ago, the conditions at
          a garment factory on West 27th
          Street were brought to my
          attention. The owners claimed
          everything was satisfactory, but
          would never let anyone in to
          conduct a proper inspection.

She reaches for Franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated
position. They are now face to face.

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          It took awhile, but we finally got in.

<b>                    FRANKLIN
</b>          We?

He searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become.
He starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top.

Eleanor sits in a chair across from him.

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          I showed up with someone from the
          Labor Board and we refused to leave
          until they let us in.

<b>                    FRANKLIN

<b>                    ELEANOR
</b>          At the risk of my good standing
          with the Junior Assistance League,
          I suggest we crash the party.

through his hair.    E

She goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light
against the candle-lit room.

They reach the befuddled Doctor on stage whose name tag
reads, "Dr. Bissell."

<b>                     ELEANOR
</b>           Thank you, Dr. Bissell for agreeing
           to let us share the stage with you
           today. It was so generous of you.

Dr. Bissell smiles limply, saving face. The audience vaguely
applauds. Franklin and Eleanor are now center stage.

<b>                     ELEANOR
</b>           My husband, as many of you may have
           read, is a victim of polio.
           However, victim is only a
           definition, not a state of mind.
           Franklin?

He looks at her completely amazed. Eleanor gives him an

</b>encouraging nod to take over.

<b>                      RANKLIN
</b>           We all know that poor circulation
           is a chronic problem for limbs
           damaged by polio... I've never been
           able to swim more than a few
           minutes without becoming too cold.
           But there's a place, gentlemen...
           a miraculous place not three hours
           from here where the water is filled
           with natural minerals at a
           temperature of almost 90 degrees.
           That place, gentlemen, is called
           Warm Springs.

<b>CLOSE-UP
</b>
One DOCTOR in particular, 60's, leans forward in his chair,
listening with great interest.

<b>                     FRANKLIN
</b>           Patients can stay in these waters
           for up to an hour. This is
           essential in allowing them the time
           to work on strengthening their
           muscles.

<b>                     ELEANOR
</b>           We have come to the shared
           conclusion that research for the
           cause and the cure for infantile
           paralysis is paramount.

<b>      ON THE AUDIENCE

      These "men of science" are mesmerized by Eleanor's style,
      both warm and immediate. She has disarmed them with her lack

      ON FRANKLIN and ELEANOR

      Their two separate journeys intersecting -- lightning in a
      bottle.

                feel is right, for you'll be
                criticized anyway. Damned if you do

      seat.

      Franklin smiles in Eleanor's direction. She looks back at him
      shyly and smiles in return. But her expression changes when
      she sees something in his eyes -- something she hasn't seen
      for a long time.

                Who are you?

      Franklin reaches out and takes her hand, pulling her close.
      He stretches his whole arm around her and places her hand on
      one of the driving knobs, his hand on top of hers.

<b>                          ELEANOR

      She slides out of the car and goes up to the platform and

        Farmer and his Wife from the school house graduation
      approach Franklin.

      They laugh knowing this is a huge understatement.

<b>                    HELENA

Eleanor takes one crutch as Helena takes the other, replacing
it in Franklin's hand with a cane.

Then, with Elliot on Franklin's left side she bends Elliot's
arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks
Franklin's left arm around his.

Going over to Franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand.

He does so.

<b>                    HELENA
</b>          Good! Now with the muscles in your
          left shoulder, pull your right leg.

</b>          That's what Elliot is for. He's
          going to hold you up. Hitch your
          leg! Come on!

Franklin and Elliot attempt to walk. It requires immense
strength and effort on both their parts.

          Elliot, don't lean in -- stand up
          straight. Pull against him. He
          needs you!

After one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms Franklin.

<b>                     FRANKLIN
</b>          I can't.

<b>                    ELLIOT
</b>          I'm strong, pop. You can't hurt me.

<b>                    HELENA
</b>          You can do this, Franklin! Keep

it's working.

<b>                    LOUIS

Roy runs in with a chair and helps Franklin into it as
Helena, Eleanor, Louis, Elliot and Roy all look at him,
concerned.

<b>                    HELENA
</b>          This isn't a replacement for the real

      Franklin's attention is diverted by something he sees
      straight ahead.

      It is the entire Warm Springs group coming down the driveway
      in chairs and on crutches.

      All the patients, the Push Boys, the physical therapists,
      Helena, Jake, Fred, Aunt Sally, Eloise and Lionel.

a small box.

He hands it to Helena. She just stares at it, at a loss for

      dozen or more REPORTERS staring incomprehensibly at the sight
      of a six foot, 200 lb. man being carried like a baby in the
      arms of a black man.

      No one does or says a thing. The PHOTOGRAPHER who had the
      wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take
      another.

      But DAN REED, a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and
      a gentle giant at over six foot-four, reaches out and places
      a massive hand over the lens.

      Louis and Eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the
      scene unfold

      Roy is sweating; his arms growing weak. Elliot brings the
      chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it.

      It's a measure of Reed's standing with this group that his
      authority is unquestioned.

      But the Photographer raises his camera again. Only now Reed
      isn't as kind. He grabs the camera from him and opens the
      back, pulling out the film and exposing it.

      Elliot throws back his head and laughs. The crowd, wanting to
      be in on it, rise as one in a sustained CHEER!

      But a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration
      from Franklin's hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip.

      Elliot, ever aware, grips him tighter, averting disaster and
      finally they reach the podium.

      Franklin grabs one side of the podium while Elliot, with a
      sleight of hand Houdini would admire, LOCKS his father's
      braces, whisks the cane away, pulls his father's speech from
      his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium.

      THE VIEW FROM BEHIND displays how Franklin's legs are spread
      wide for stability as he clutches the podium. He holds on
      tightly, as if the wood might snap from his grip.

      Four years later, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected
      President of the United States. He was elected three more
      times -- unprecedented in U.S. History.

      During his years as President, he saw the country through the
      Great Depression and a world war waged on six continents.

      On April 12, 1945, in the thirteenth year of his presidency,
      at the age of sixty-three, Franklin Roosevelt died in his
      cottage at Warm Springs.

      The beneficiary of his $562,000 life insurance policy was
      Warm Springs... which continues to flourish as a
      rehabilitation center to this day.
