           An attractive FEMALE SCIENTIST in a gore-spattered lab
           coat moves fearfully along a wall, passing benches strewn
           with broken lab equipment. Her ample bosom heaves as she
           PANTS nervously, mascara-rimmed eyes darting to and fro.
           Glass SMASHES on the floor nearby and MELODRAMATIC MUSIC
           swells. The woman backs into a shadow, not noticing a
           pair of dead eyes catching the moonlight behind her.
           The music climbs to a frenzy as something GROANS horribly
           into the woman's ear. She spins around on her stiletto
           heels as a rotted face looms out of the darkness,
           drooling through broken teeth, and lunges at her neck.

           dishwasher. She is in her late thirties, and wears `mom'
           clothes that do no favors for her figure. His father,

           trying hard to delineate chin from neck. He stands on a

</b>
           Its industrial days now rusted behind it, Blithe Hollow
           has become a run-down tourist town, celebrating its
           heritage with lame fetes and crass knick-knacks. A
           massive billboard beside the main square reads "BLITHE
           HOLLOW - A GREAT PLACE TO HANG!" illustrated by a group
           of waving Puritans beside an equally cheerful witch
           hanging from a gallows. Across the street a huge banner
           suggests this year is particularly important for the
           town; "BLITHE HOLLOW - 300 BEWITCHIN' YEARS!"
           The town center is lacking in charm; its historical
           buildings subsumed into a vulgar modern thoroughfare with
           gaudy witch-themed shop fronts and cracked sidewalks.
           Everywhere Norman walks, the witch theme is prevalent.
           Cars have bumper stickers that extol such witticisms as
           "MY OTHER CAR IS A BROOM". There's a dingy bar, the BAR
           GENTO, and a greeting card store called BEST WITCHES.
           Norman hurries past SHERIFF HOOPER, a heavyset black
           woman, and DEPUTY DWAYNE, lanky and awkward and looking
           like he'd rather be elsewhere.

<b>                          SHERIFF HOOPER
</b>           Watch and learn. "Parking
           violation" is my middle name.

<b>                          DEPUTY DWAYNE
</b>           Really? I thought it was Rhona.
           They glance up disdainfully as Norman passes by. Clearly
           in this town Norman has something of a bad reputation.

                         

<b>          12 EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MORNING 12
</b>
           Norman walks up a tree lined path that leads to a squat
           school building. Out front, the name "BLITHE HOLLOW
           MIDDLE SCHOOL" is carved into an ugly hunk of granite.
           ParaNorman 9.

<b>                         12 CONTINUED: 12
</b>           SCHOOL KIDS line the path in front of Norman; a gauntlet
           of jeering, merciless, pre-pubescent horror. Norman takes
           a deep breath as he begins his daily walk of ridicule.
           Most of the kids give him a wide berth, but others sneer
           and WHISPER as he passes.
           A bell RINGS the start of the school day, and everyone
           makes a bee-line for the building.
           Someone barges Norman with their shoulder, knocking his
           backpack to the ground. Other kids SNICKER as they step
           over him.
           As the last of them head through the lobby doors, Norman
           is left alone on the path.
           Norman bends down to retrieve his spilled possessions,
           and a dark shape beyond the gate catches his eye.
           NORMAN'S POV - Mr Prenderghast, barely visible as he
           stands within the shadow of a tree, stares back at him.
           Norman frowns and squints his eyes, but now sees only
           trees and shadows, so he continues up the steps.

</b>
           An expanse of unevenly lacquered floor, scuffed by scores
           of dragged heels. Rows of dented lockers line the walls.
           Norman stands before his locker, across which someone has
           daubed the word "FREAK" in marker. Clearly something of a
           daily ritual, he reaches inside, takes out a bottle of
           surface cleaner and a rag and proceeds to wipe it off.
           Across the hallway, another kid is removing graffiti from
           his locker. NEIL is overweight with frizzy red hair, and
           is busily rubbing a handkerchief over the word "FATTY".
           He watches Norman with interest.
           A voice behind his shoulder gives Norman a start.

</b>           Hey, ghost jerk! You know what?
           Norman turns to find textbook bully ALVIN, the only 6th
           grader in his class who shaves, looming over him. He is
           flanked by a couple of leering sycophants, one of whom
           wears a T-shirt emblazoned with "TEAM ALVIN".

           Alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker

</b>           That is so Alvin!
           The bullies strut away, content in the psychological
           damage they've managed to inflict.

           Norman mutters as they leave, but not loud enough so as

           Across the hall, Neil continues to watch with sympathy,
           but he is already being hurried along by his friend
           SALMA, a nerdy Indian kid with braces.

           Amidst stacked bleachers, foam mats and stray dodge
           balls, a crudely constructed stage fills one end of the
           gymnasium. Mediocre art class scenery represents a
           colonial town, complete with plywood hills, chapel and
           crescent moon dangling perilously from a basketball hoop.
           In a director's chair far too small for the job is MRS
           HENSCHER, an imposing woman with spectacles and beret who
           looks like she smells of too-much perfume.
           At the front of the stage wearing a pilgrim hat and
           carrying a large scroll, is NORMAN. He is surrounded by
           kids whose attempts at home made period costume leave a
           lot to be desired.

           Salma is holding her hand up. She looks like the Wicked
           Witch of the West. Even beneath green makeup and plastic
           warty nose, it is clear she is not best pleased.

           Mrs Henscher's knuckles clench white around her script.
           She attempts an understanding smile, in the same way a
           shark might.

           As she launches into her lecture, Norman notices a change
           in the room. The lights dim, the wind outside picks up,
           and indistinct shapes flicker at the corners of his eyes.
           Norman glances around at the other kids on the stage, to
           see if they are seeing what he is seeing. For a split
           second the children are replaced with faded figures in
           real Puritan dress. Seven solemn figures.
           As he turns around nervously, Norman sees the suggestion
           of another place fizzing in and out of the shadows...

           not realizing Alvin has slung the hangman's noose around
           Norman's neck.
           Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who
           keels over, rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall. He
           lands on top of Salma, her kicking legs sticking out from
           under him as though Dorothy's house had just landed on

           open into a hag-like mouth. It furrows a mossy brow and
           speaks in a low rumbling voice.

           frowns and watches as it stops unravelling and a draught

           His cell phone BEEPS from his pocket, giving him a start.
           He takes it out and reads a text; "COME TO THE WINDOW".
           Norman cautiously walks over and peers around the edge of
           the window frame.
           A figure stands motionless in the yard below, sheets of
           laundry billowing off the clothes line beside it. It
           stares up at Norman through the blank eye holes of a
           hockey mask.
           Norman GASPS and jumps back.
           With a frown, he re-emerges and opens the window.
           The figure lifts the mask, and Neil beams out from
           underneath, waving excitedly.

<b>                          GRANDMA BABCOCK

           She smiles, floating in a sitting position at the end of
           Norman's bed. She bobs gently, like a balloon. For a
           second, this seems to comfort Norman, but then another
           thought crosses his mind.

           Norman thinks this over, then smiles up at her again. She
           goes to rub his head affectionately, but her ghost hand
           just passes right through his spiky hair.
           She gives him a wink, and drifts away through the wall.
           He is still scared, but now determined too. He steels
           himself and grabs his jacket from his bed.

           On a street corner two teenage girls approach Alvin and
           Pug, who have laid out a breakdancing mat and a beatbox
           and are doing their best to impress. Alvin imagines he is
           wowing the girls with his krumping, his ham-like limbs
           flying around and Pug hollering support, but in truth
           they watch in morbid fascination.
           A faint CLATTERING sound down the road grows louder.
           Norman suddenly THUNDERS past them on his bike, spinning
           Alvin on the spot and knocking him onto his butt.
           Show over, Alvin blunders to his feet, his eyes following
           Norman's trajectory up the dark road, and GROWLS.

           Tall conifers rise up high on either side of the road,
           now little more than a dirt track. Norman pedals up the
           hill and swerves, skidding to a stop in the gravel.
           He climbs off the bike, eyes fixed on a ramshackle house
           partially hidden in the foliage, its porch door swinging
           and CREAKING eerily in the breeze.
           He cautiously advances past a crooked mailbox on which is
           written "PRENDERGHAST", and steps onto the wooden porch.

           Motes of dust float around Norman as he moves slowly
           toward a door, slightly ajar, muttering to himself.
           He quietly makes his way past all manner of objects that
           epitomize the state of Mr Prenderghast's mind; a
           mannequin in a shopping cart, a pile of broken

           The study is filled with teetering piles of junk and old
           furniture draped over in dust sheets. A crucifix hangs
           over a metal cot with rumpled bedding. This is evidently
           where the old man lived his whole life. Starlight from a
           window picks out a macabre halo on a shape on the floor:
           Mr Prenderghast, dead where he fell, tightly clutching a
           leather-bound book.
           CLOSE ON Norman's face as he swallows nervously and steps
           closer to the body. He gingerly takes hold of the book
           and gives a gentle tug. It holds fast in the rigor mortis
           grasp. He tugs harder, shaking the book repeatedly, the
           corpse shaking with it.

           Norman spends several strenuous moments dragging the body
           across the floorboards, Mr Prenderghast's head glancing
           off table legs and smacking repeatedly against the
           floorboards, as Norman tries to wrestle the book free.
           With a final yank the book pulls loose and, GASPING,
           Norman grips the book to his chest and runs to the door.

           poking out amidst tangles of thorns.
           Clutching the book tight, Norman wrenches open the heavy
           gate, its rusted padlock crumbling apart.
           Eventually the track runs up to a stone slab surrounded
           on either side by thick bramble. Norman brushes aside
           vines and reads an epitaph engraved into the stone;

           something eerily playful in the movement of the tendrils.
           The boys are jolted as an awful high pitched SCREAM blows
           through the graveyard like a shockwave, pulsing through
           the fog like a heartbeat.
           Norman and Alvin cover their ears and cower as the fog

           mud-encrusted shapes begin to emerge through the earth.

           dancing and whirling about the hatching figures.

           CLOSE ON one of the figures crawling out of the ground
           into a patch of moonlight. Ragged and rotten it wears the
           mud-encrusted clothes of a colonial Puritan. It stares

           Thunder that sounds like deep and abysmal LAUGHTER echoes

           headstone, this one engraved with the name "JUDGE
           HOPKINS". They leap aside as the ground swells beneath
           their feet, and the DEAD JUDGE punches through the dirt,
           bolt upright. His face wears a rictus grin and he looms
           over the boys like the Grim Reaper in a powdered wig.
           He tilts his head curiously when he sees the book in

           The boys tremble in their hiding places trying not to

           Norman lying underneath the bed. The footsteps grow

           NORMAN'S POV - rotten legs step up to Mr Prenderghast's
           body, lying where he fell on the floorboards. Two
           withered feet suddenly step right up to the bed.
           Something drops onto the floor inches in front of
           Norman's face with an unpleasant SLAP. Norman's eyes bug
           out as he realizes it is a zombie's dislodged ear. A
           weltered arm reaches down to grope around for the body
           part, until Norman pushes the ear, as carefully as he can
           manage, back into the zombie's fingers. The hand retreats
           back out from under the bed.
           There is a loud SCREAM as Alvin, unable to contain
           himself any longer, jumps out from his hiding place and
           makes for the door. The corpses look up as he disappears
           down the hall, then stagger after him.
           Norman takes this chance to follow, but the Dead Judge
           blocks his exit. They both stand quite still, staring
           into each others' eyes. The corpse tilts its head, almost
           quizzically, and its eyes widen as it notices the book
           under his arm.
           Norman steps sideways to run past it, but the corpse does
           too. Both it and Norman step one way, then the other, and
           back again. Norman feigns one direction and quickly bolts
           in the other, past the corpse and out the door.

           toward them. Norman hears his MOAN.
           Norman swings the door back open, the zombie on the other

           Following the noise, the Judge staggers along some way
           behind. He surveys the scene as he emerges, his
           featureless face doing a nevertheless effective job of
           expressing horrified shock.
           After a moment, he comes to his senses, and spies the
           kids in the distance. A look of resolve crosses his face,
           turning quickly to surprise as a SHOT rings out nearby.
           The Judge looks down to a large hole blown through his
           midriff. Framed within it is Crystal, several feet away,
           rifle smoking. He looks up again, weighs up his chances,
           then lets out a ROAR of retreat to his beleaguered
           companions before running off into the shadows.
           Those zombies who haven't already tried to run for cover
           manage to extricate themselves from the frenzy and follow
           the Judge's CRY, some of them breaking into a sprint.

           He bends down to pick it up. His eyes flash angrily at

           CRACKS all around them. The air is grey and caustic and
           filled with flakes of charcoal and burning ash.
           A burning timber GROANS as it splits from the ceiling and
           tumbles toward the children. They SCREAM and scatter as

           take a few steps back.
           The crowd GASPS again as the charred front door of the

           Norman turns to the Dead Judge. The Judge nods solemnly,
           pointing ahead.
           Norman steels himself and begins to march forward through
           the thick brambles, the others following behind.

           Exhausted but determined, Norman finds the source of the
           supernatural storm; a clearing sculpted out of the forest
           by Aggie's fury.
           In the center of it all is the tree, bleached white as
           bone and grotesquely twisted. The trees around it CREAK
           and GROAN as though they'd like to uproot and plant
           themselves someplace else.
           Beneath this tree lie Aggie's remains, buried three
           hundred years ago. Now a mess of roots and rocks open out
           like an ugly wound, and within them a tiny childlike
           figure is barely visible through a spitting furnace of
           spectral energy. Ectoplasm rages up around the tree's
           finger-like branches like a mushroom cloud of negative
           energy. It's a child's tantrum turned atomic.

<b>                          AGGIE (CONT'D)
</b>           I... I remember my mommy brought
           me here once. We sat under the
           tree and she told me stories. They
           all had happy endings.

<b>                          (BROW FURROWS)
</b>           And then those horrible men came
           and took me away and I never saw
           her again!
           She scowls angrily at the butterfly flitting past her
           face. It instantly crumples up into ashes. Surprised, she
           GASPS and watches the blackened dust fall to the ground.
           There's anger in Aggie, but there is confusion, sadness
           and regret there too. She isn't quite so scary anymore.

<b>                          NORMAN
</b>           Sometimes when people get scared
           they say and do terrible things. I
           think you got so scared, that you
           forgot who you are. But I don't
           think you're a witch. Not really.
           Aggie looks into his eyes.

</b>           I think you're just a little kid
           with a really special gift who
           only ever wanted people to
           understand her.
           He smiles softly.

<b>                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
</b>           So we're not all that different at
           all.

<b>                          AGGIE
</b>           But what about the people who hurt
           you? Don't you ever want to make
           them suffer?
           Norman thinks this over, and shrugs.

<b>                          NORMAN
</b>           Well, yeah, but what good would
           that do? You think just because
           there's bad people out there that
           there's no good ones either? I
           thought the same thing.

           Somewhere.
           Aggie frowns, looking lost.

           again.
           Aggie holds Norman's gaze, then looks down to the ground,
           her tiny frame heaving with a last SOB. She sits down on
           the grass and curls up, resting her head on her hands.
           Norman kneels down next to her as she closes her eyes.
           Her breathing grows deeper and more peaceful; her tiny
           frame shifting softly under her long hair.
           The air around them grows blurry and indistinct. Aggie
           softens as though out of focus, and the whole world
           becomes a swirling dance of glowing orbs. Norman closes
           his eyes as a blizzard of light engulfs him, spiraling up
           into the clouds high above his head.
           Lightning flashes white far above and thunder RUMBLES
           softly through the sky, as if moving away.

           The zombies form a group in the center of the square, all
           of them looking up into the clouds. The people around
           them stop and stare, awestruck as a breeze buffets their
           clothes and the air around them begins to shimmer.
           As the modern townsfolk watch on, some of the zombies
           take each others' arms for support. Those with eyelids
           close them. One by one their bodies dissolve away,
           leaving ethereal figures in their place.

           He sits upon the upturned root of the tree, the earth
