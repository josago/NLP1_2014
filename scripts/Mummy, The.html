               The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on 
               the African continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT 
               rises up. WE PUSH IN on it, towards a CITY along the Nile, 
               it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP PUSHING IN until 
               the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves 
               DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not 
               ancient.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.

<b>                                    THEBES - 2,134 B.C
</b>
               Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:

<b>                                     NARRATOR
</b>                         Thebes. City of the Living. Crown 
                         jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

               The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn 
               CHARIOT comes barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; 
               an aristocratic, virile old man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.

<b>               INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK
</b>
               Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, 
               muscular MAN with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.

<b>                                     NARRATOR
</b>                         Home of Imhotep, High Priest of 
                         Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

               A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It 
               takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's 
               wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked 
               body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a 
               stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.

<b>                                     NARRATOR
</b>                         Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's 
                         Mistress. No other man was allowed 
                         to touch her.

               She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA 
               comes to a stop on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then 
               it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's really a strange looking 
               TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald MEN stand 
               nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their 
               eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains.

               Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, 
               feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body, 
               smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with lust:

<b>                                     NARRATOR
</b>                         But for our love, we were willing to 
                         risk life itself.

               And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself 
               on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush 
               over and close the doors. But just as they do, the doors 
               suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at 
               the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, -- 
<b>               SUBTITLED.
</b>
<b>                                     PHARAOH
</b>                         What are you doing here?

               The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival 
               was unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws 
               them back.

               Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh 
               sees the smeared body paint. Points his finger.

<b>                                     PHARAOH
</b><b>                         WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!
</b>
               From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. 
               Pharaoh spins around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.

<b>                                     PHARAOH
</b>                         Imhotep?... My priest.

               Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into 
               his back.

               Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous 
               bald Priests SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the 
               curtains, they see the SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep 
               stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the doors are RAMMED from 
               the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and 
               look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers 
               share desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and 
               grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony.

</b>                         Pharaoh's bodyguards!

               Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's 
               sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.

<b>                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
</b>                         You must go. Save yourself. Only you 
                         can resurrect me.

               Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN.

               MEN with BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over 
               their bodies stride in, armed to the teeth. These are the 
               MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony 
               just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.

               Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses --

<b>                                     ANCK-SU-NAMUN
</b>                         My body is no longer his temple!

               She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. Out on the balcony, 
               Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream...

<b>                                     NARRATOR/IMHOTEP
</b>                         For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's 
                         body was to be cursed. And it was I, 
                         the High Priest, whose duty it was 
                         to curse it.

<b>               EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT
</b>
               Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-
               su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her 
               down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         Her body was mummified, her vital 
                         organs removed and placed in sacred 
                         canopic jars.

               Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of 
               pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         The Book of The Living contained 
                         sacred incantations that would send 
                         the evil dead on a journey into the 
                         dark underworld.

               Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves 
               and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled 
               eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising.

               Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, 
               and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the 
               ground.

               Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus.

               The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand. 
               Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears 
               at the Nubians. Killing them.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         The slaves were killed...

               Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed 
               Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as 
               Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         ...and the soldiers who killed them 
                         were also slain, so that no unholy 
                         person should ever know the exact 
                         location of the burial site.

               The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the 
               Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
               vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant 
               dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's 
               grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.

<b>               EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT
</b>
               CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the 
               way. A "hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF 
               ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         But there was another book, The Book 
                         Of The Dead, which was never to be 
                         opened, never to be read, for it 
                         contained the incantations that could 
                         bring a dead body back to life a 
                         most unholy thing.

               The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. 
               They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.

               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

                              HAMUNAPTRA - City of the Dead

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of 
                         the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, 
                         so that no such sacrilege might ever 
                         disgrace Egypt.

<b>               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT
</b>
               Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT 
               inside the giant STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and 
               lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD, made of black stone.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         But for my love of Anck-su-namun I 
                         was willing to defy the gods.

<b>               INT. UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT
</b>
               Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the 
               headstones of this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY.

               A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the cemetery, -- muck made out of 
               filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in the goop. The 
               Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless 
               eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and 
               forth as they CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures.

               In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted ALTAR.

               Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless 
               body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         Anck-su-namun's vital organs were 
                         still fresh, so a human sacrifice 
                         would not need be made.

               As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large 
               SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. Several 
               Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back 
               down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST wafts up out of the 
               swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them 
               and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the 
               heart inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING 
               HOLE, WAFTING MIST, BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are 
               reaching a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         Anck-su-namun soul had come back 
                         from the dead! Now all that was 
                         needed, was to return her organs to 
                         their rightful place within her body.

               Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's 
               breast, about to plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and 
               BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's when the Mumia BURST IN and 
               storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD MUMIA SMASHES 
               the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks 
               back out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the 
               swirling hole.

               Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS 
               in rage. The Mumia grab him and his Priests.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         My Priests were condemned to be

<b>               INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER (NECROPOLIS RE-VAMP) - NIGHT
</b>
               Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed 
               EMBALMERS. He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic 
               glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive.

               The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and 
               thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING 
               Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.

               A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.

               A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His 
               eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red 
               hot poker up his nose.

               But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, 
               horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.

               WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests 
               squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.

               His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         As for me, I was condemned to endure 
                         the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient 
                         curses. One so horrible, it had never 
                         before been bestowed.

               Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's 
               TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on 
               top of it. WE GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is 
               apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue 
               onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.

               Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and 
               fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus 
               muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the 
               fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.

               He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.

               An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.

               Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the 
               bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting 
               dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.

               Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP
</b>                         By eating the sacred scarabs, I would 
                         be cursed to stay alive forever. And 
                         by eating me, they were cursed just 
                         the same.

               The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange 
               four-sided KEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight.

               The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a 
               loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. Once again, the Head Mumia 
               uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.

                         sarcophagus, the undead for all of 
                         eternity.

               The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses 
               the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle

                         released. For I would arise a walking 
                         disease, a plague upon mankind, an 
                         unholy flesh-eater, with the strength 
                         of ages, power over the sands, and 
                         the glory of invincibility.

               Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The 
               disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and 
               then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.

                         together, we would be an unstoppable 
                         infection upon this world. The 
                         Apocalypse. The End.

               Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming 
               from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt 
               onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM:

</b>
               The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave.

               Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, 
               the jackal-headed god of death. It stares at us. Then begins 
               to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only 
               seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half-
               buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.

               Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior

               A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN 
               LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the 
               onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a 
               jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL.

               He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at 
               him.

               A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across 
               the top of the wall. This is BENI.

<b>                                     BENI

</b>                         Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

               Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.

                         we can still make it.

               O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.

                         use it anyway.

               Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell.

                         ever does that anymore.

               O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver

               O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.

               The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. 
               Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.

                         was synagogues. How about you? Kill 
                         somebody?

               Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground.

               O'Connell gives him a nasty look.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         No, but I'm considering it.

               They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp

                         here!?

               They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the 
               horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening.

               O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         I was just looking for a good time.

               And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly 
               panics, cuts and runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Oh shit. Steady!

               Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde 
               Hoofs pounding the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL

                         What the hell am I sayin'?

               The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog 
               SCREAMS. More Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL

                         What the hell am I doin'?

               The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels 
               himself, cocks and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly 
               snaps, he spits it into the sand. Another BEAT. And then --

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b><b>                         FIRE!
</b>
               The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with 
               a CRASH. The BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their 
               mounts. The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.

</b><b>                         FIRE!
</b>
               The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand.

               The remaining warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the 
               hot air. A third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b><b>                         FIRE!
</b>
               The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off 
               their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg 
               force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires.

               O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING 
               riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.

               Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, 
               whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all 
               around him. He crawls through the front gate.

               O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He 
               cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off 
               their mounts.

               Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY 
               amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as 
               the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind 
               him. O'Connell's guns go empty.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Son-of-a-bitch.

               He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate.

               Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him.

               O'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running.

               He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the 
               heavy sandstone door.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Hey! Beni! Wait up!

               Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         What are ya doing?! Wait up!

               O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen 
               LEAP the big column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU 
<b>                         CLOSE THAT DOOR!
</b>
               Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell 
               SLAMS his body into the door. It doesn't budge.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         I'm gonna get you for this!

               He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his 
               life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer 
               and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER.

               O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The 
               four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The 
               vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off.

               O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he 
               slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.

               And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them 
               REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The 
               horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like 
               fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared 
               them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their 
               mounts.

               O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right 
               hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the 
               evil himself, and turns around. -- The shattered, decrepit 
               statue of Anubis stares back at him.

               Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet.

               He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming 
               sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing 
               beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture.

               O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The 
               sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the 
               sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.

               Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble 
               clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence 
               and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have 
               BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS.

               The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this 
               time.

               The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with 
               dual scimitars across his waist. His face is both handsome 
               and horrible, blue and tattooed. Meet ARDETH RAY. His dark

               Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon 
               rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the 
               Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between 
               two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, 
               is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- 
               a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare.

               This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with 
               her.

               Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows 
               the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books 
               whose titles all begin with the letter "O". Then she grabs 
               another book out from under her arm and reads the title.

                         here?

               Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her 
               shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles 
               begin with the letter "T". Then she looks down. It's a long 
               way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down 
               on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
               across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too 
               far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder 
               with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.

               And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn 
               YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the 
               ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, 
               swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her 
               balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts 
               stiltwalking down the aisle.

</b><b>                         OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!
</b>
               The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads 
               back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling 
               for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and 
               picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into 
               another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
               bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.

               And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES 
               into the next bookshelf.

               Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She 
               looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf 
               crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after 
               bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and 
               scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last 
               shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She 
               opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other 
               eye and stares at the huge mess.

                         the other plagues were a joy!

               Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.

               Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.

                         mess!

               The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming.

               And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.

<b>                                     EVELYN
</b>                         Hello?

               Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly 
               shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.

<b>                                     EVELYN

               Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters --

<b>               INT. THE RAMESSEUM
</b>
               Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. 
               It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from 
               FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery.

               The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly 
               shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch.

               Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they 
               stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She 
               walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases 
               of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this 
               one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks 
               around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans 
               forward with the torch, and peers inside.

               -- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her!

               Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out 
               of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, 
               she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad 
               crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half 
               drunk.

               Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, 
               Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.

                         the way you've ruined yours.

               He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.

<b>                                     EVELYN
</b>                         High note? Ha! For five years you've 
                         been scrounging around Egypt, and 
                         what have you to show for it? Nothing.

               Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         Oh yes I do! I have something right

                         Jonathan, if I bring one more piece 
                         of junk to the Curator to try and 
                         sell for you.

               Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY 
               to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly 
               curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.

<b>                                     EVELYN

               Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.

</b>                         On a dig, down in Thebes.

               Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself 
               as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it.

               Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.

<b>                                     JONATHAN

                         something.

               Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the 
               box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle 
               box. Then suddenly, it UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, 
               turning itself into the KEY. Sitting inside the open key/box 
               is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT MAP.

<b>               INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's 
               eyepiece at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.

                         this fellow, like him very much.

               The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same 
               map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.

                         the story. The entire necropolis was 
                         rigged to sink into the sand. On

               The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws 
               it to the floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly 
               puts it out. Lifts it up. The left third of the map is now 
               missing.

               The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches

               The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.

</b>                         He said... he was just looking for a 
                         good time.

               The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, 
               dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars.

               From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is 
               half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new 
               bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.

               O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.

                         total loss.

               Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.

                         I tremble with anticipation.

               A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face 
               bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks 
               back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.

                         Hamunaptra.

               Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards 
               didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.

<b>                                     EVELYN

                         was there.

               Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         How do we know that's not a load of 
                         pig swallow?

               O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL

</b>                         Um, well, you see...

               O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan 
               square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A 
               Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again.

               He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look.

               Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell.

               O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.

               The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.

               Evelyn leans in even closer.

               She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited

</b>                         Yes.

               O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.

</b>                         Then get me the hell outta here.

               Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off 
               the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, 
               YANKS him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.

               Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth.

               Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as 
               the hangman's noose is draped over O'Connell's head and 
               cinched tight around his neck. Evelyn follows the warden 
               onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners all go dead 
               quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh 
               meat.

</b>                         I am an English woman.

               This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.

               O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden.

               O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than 
               Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him.

</b>                         Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

               The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.

</b>                         And what else?

               Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.

               Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the 
               Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.

               O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays out. Then 
               JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.

               But he's still alive, because --

               The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.

               The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the 
               end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly 
               turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.

               At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and 
               turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.

               Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as 
               he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

               The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic. 
               A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES 
               to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.

               All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up 
               at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.

                         the map to guide them, how can they 
                         possibly find Hamunaptra?

               WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a 
               PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS.

               Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the 
               docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn 
               and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS 
               selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.

               They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit 
               and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more 
               dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.

<b>                                     EVELYN
</b>                         Oh... um,... hello.

               Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.

                         adventure, eh, O'Connell?

               O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Yeah, sure, smashing.

               He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the 
               bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.

<b>                                     BURNS

                         entire garrison, sahib.

               And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head, 
               as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the 
               men.

<b>                                     BENI

                         but there is much work to be done.

               Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.

               BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.

<b>                                     EVELYN

                         not some sort of flimflam? Because 
                         if it is, I'm warning you --

               O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks 
               her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         All I can tell you, miss, is that my 
                         Colonel found that map in an ancient 
                         fortress, and the whole damn garrison 
                         believed in it so much, that without 
                         orders, we marched halfway across 
                         Libya and into Egypt to find that 
                         city. Like I told ya, all I saw was 
                         sand. Everybody else was wiped out 
                         by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your 
                         bags.

               O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
               the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on.

               Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.

<b>                                     JONATHAN

                         a complete scoundrel, nothing to 
                         like there at all.

               Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's 
               when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy 
               hat.

<b>                                     WARDEN

               And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.

               WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
               Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into --

<b>               EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT
</b>
               The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA 
               quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one 
               with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two 
               row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.

<b>               EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT
</b>
               Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell 
               comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.

                         hundred dollars says we get to 
                         Hamunaptra before you?

               O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.

</b>                         Yer on.

               Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

</b>                         What makes you?

               Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.

                         there.

               O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan.

</b>                         I say, what a coincidence, why --

               O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the 
               gunnysack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.

<b>               EXT. BARGE - NIGHT

               Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.

               The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

</b>                         The only thing that scares me, Mister 
                         O'Connell, are your manners.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

</b>                         If you call that a kiss.

               O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out 
               revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, 
               and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.

<b>                                     EVELYN

                         everybody I was with died.

               This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts 
               dismantling and cleaning the guns.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL

                         think is out there?

               O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.

</b>                         Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin

               She gives him a know-it-all grin.

                         believe that one of the most famous 
                         books in history is buried out there, 
                         The Book Of The Living. It's what 
                         first interested me in Egypt as a 
                         child. It's why I came here, sort of 
                         a life's pursuit.

</b>                         And the fact that they say it's made 
                         out of pure gold, makes no nevermind 
                         to you, right?

               Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.

<b>                                     EVELYN

</b>                         I know my treasure.

               Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns 
               back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:

<b>                                     EVELYN
</b>                         By the way,... why did you kiss me?

               O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL

                         like a good idea at the time.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.

               O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.

</b>                         What?... Wha'd I say?

               Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly 
               reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.

<b>                                     BENI

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Why if it ain't my little buddy, 
                         Beni. I oughta kill you.

               O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows 
               hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.

<b>                                     BENI
</b>                         You never were any good with the 
                         ladies, O'Connell.

</b>                         So you're the one leading the 
                         Americans, I shoulda figured. So 
                         what's the scam? You get 'em out in 
                         the middle of the desert then leave 
                         'em to rot?

<b>                                     BENI
</b>                         Unfortunately no, these Americans 
                         are smart, they pay me only half 
                         now, half when I get them back to 
                         Cairo, so I must go all the way.

               O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.

<b>                                     BENI
</b>                         You never believed in Hamunaptra, 
                         O'Connell. Why are you going back? 
                         The devil himself lives out there.

               They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the 
               HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and 
               backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         The girl saved my life, figured it 
                         was the least I could do, keep her 
                         out of trouble.

<b>                                     BENI
</b>                         You always did have more balls than 
                         brains.

               O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Let's make us even, shall we?

</b>                         Even?

               O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.

               Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack 
               and starts walking off down the deck.

<b>                                     BENI (O.S.)
</b>                         O'Connell! I am going to kill you 
                         for this!

</b>                         Sounds familiar.

               And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming 
               up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.

               O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.

<b>               INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT
</b>
               Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror.

               She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose 
               over her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE 
               IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his hand 
               over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.

<b>                                     HOOK
</b>                         Where is the map?

               Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees 
               the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.

<b>                                     HOOK
</b>                         And the key? Where is the key?

               Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins.

<b>                                     HOOK
</b>                         Then I'll find it myself.

               He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.

               Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.

               O'Connell looks at her.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Friend of yours?

               Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table 
               FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell 
               spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.

               FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's 
               head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.

               FIRING BLINDLY. A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene 
               SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs 
               the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder, 
               right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.

               O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.

<b>               HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.

               He shoves her up against a wall.

</b>                         Oh that's comforting.

               O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         C'mon, there's still one more of

<b>               EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye 
               and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on 
               the floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the 
               door is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks 
               him into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.

</b><b>                         EVY!!

               Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up. A 
               HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         Hey that's mine --

               It's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.

               Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.

<b>               EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT
</b>
               O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse 
               paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.

               BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.

               O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the 
               other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.

               Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the 
               paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their 
               heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The 
               Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep 
               up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now 
               ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL

</b>                         Trust me.

               He picks her up and throws her over the side.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         The occasion calls for it.

               Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after 
               her.

<b>               EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT
</b>
               Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, 
               guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything 
               in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.

</b>                         Americans.

               Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH.

               Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his 
               FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes 
               widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to 
               strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook 
               over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         I say! Good show!

               Then he points his thumb at himself

</b>                         And did I panic?

               He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back.

</b>                         I think not.

               And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan 
               dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.

<b>               NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the 
               water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she 
               wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices.

               Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the 
               far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.

               Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand 
               CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking...

               O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading

               the reins of four ugly old camels.

               changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.

                         Disgusting.

               The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile 
               green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his 
               gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.

               The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking 
               across the vast wasteland.

               Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the 
               rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden 
               SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to 
               slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her, 
               then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking 
               her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he 
               looks up at a distant ridge --

               -- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing 
               them.

               The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking 
               out of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the

               The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of 
               the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE 
               DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel, 
               the rest ride horses.

               O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred 
               feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless 
               horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.

               O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.

               Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts 
               to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.

               Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the 
               sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.

               Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then --

               O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard. Beni watches the 
               Americans and spits into the sand.

               And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.

               Passing across the sun as it goes. It's a MIRAGE.

               The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other 
               way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.

               The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.

               The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the 
               volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell 
               and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And 
               the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from 
               his horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it 
               to the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.

               The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.

               The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.

               And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.

               And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else 
               hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.

               And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.

               Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell. 
               Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!

               But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni 
               off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.

               Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never 
               felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this 
               girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of 
               the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past 
               him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.

               Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands 
               in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.

               O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.

               The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next 
               to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.

               O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
               the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan 
               bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS 
               and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.

               Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden 
               and realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops 
               sniffing.

               Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall, 
               then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF 
               LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. -- THE RAY OF LIGHT

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way 
               through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat 
               warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and 
               freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.

               They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker 
               and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and 
               louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan 
               licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.

               They slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
               an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.

               Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the 
               other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn 
               behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!

               O'Connell LEAPS OUT. -- THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT

               it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.

               And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step 
               out of the shadows, -- all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.

               O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun, 
               grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then 
               Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.

<b>               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.

               A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of 
               black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred 
               beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and 
               starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.

<b>               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's 
               found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist 
               brushes sand away from the seam. Henderson steps forward and 
               grabs the seam, -- the Egyptologist quickly stops him.

               Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes

<b>                                     HENDERSON
</b>                         Yeah, sure...

               He looks back at the native Diggers.

</b>                         We'll let him open it.

               The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.

               The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out 
               his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers 
               hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into 
               the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless.

               Beni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back 
               away as well.

               And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.

               O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES 
               for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE 
               CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.

<b>               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER
</b>
               Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their 
               guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, 
               he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS --

               The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, 
               The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The 
               compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers 
               give one final pull and --

<b>               -- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS

<b>               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan 
               slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.

               We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS.

</b>                         They didn't, they buried him at the 
                         foot of Anubis. He was either someone 
                         of great importance. Or he did 
                         something very naughty.

<b>               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then 
               greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops 
               it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly 
               falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.

               CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.

               The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to 
               WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.

               Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE 
               scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly 
               burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

               The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his 
               knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, 
               higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
               large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS 
               IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The 
               Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The 
               lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and 
<b>               COUGHING.
</b>
               And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.

<b>               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, 
               revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it 
               Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.

               Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.

               Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.

                         the hook, he was looking for a key.

               Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back.

               Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's 
               now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles.

               And that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through 
               the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.

<b>               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

               The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the 
               labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden 
               starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, 
               he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the 
               labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The 
               Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, 
               breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves...

               Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the 
               scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY 
               PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, --
               Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the 
               pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.

               Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily 
               And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear 
               to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then 
               a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.

               bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.

               The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS

               multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps 
               SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.

               O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, 
               who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.

               Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down 
               with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, 
               LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to 
               the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point 
               blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell 
               is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.

               A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, 
               misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider 
               off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.

               Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, 
               she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.

               A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly 
               backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises 
               his scimitar, about to strike.

               Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant 
               gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS 
               him twenty feet back into some ruins.

               At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and 
               over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand 
               dune.

               Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the 
               temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.

               Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.

</b>                         Let 'em have it, boys!

               Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, 
               the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.

</b>                         I say, bloody good show.

               And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land 
               behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around 
               and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.

               O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something 
               THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray 
               on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises 
               his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!

               Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, 
               O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick 
               of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It 
               IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two 
               men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray 
               points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.

</b><b>                         OR DIE!
</b>
               Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after 
               him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, 
               then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn 
               staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her 
               and holds her close.

</b>                         You alright?

               Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time 
               he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's 
               also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.

               Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and 
               Burns help Daniels to his feet.

               Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.

               Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.

               Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close 
               and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.

               O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, 
               the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the 
               bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --

               Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.

               She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES 
               HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, 
               slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and 
               just smiles.

               Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and 
               turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are 
               heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.

               They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.

               PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.

               O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops, 
               appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF 
               and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly

               Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out

               They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the 
               'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years 
               have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.

               Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden

               Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and

               O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there

               This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer.

               The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed 
               at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches 
               inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes 
               widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and 
               slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book 
               Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to 
               life.

               Daniels kicks the chest. It breaks open, unfolding to reveal 
               a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL

               The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni 
               are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan 
               wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.

               O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.

               The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.

               Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple 
               and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the 
               Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, 
               the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn 
               stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks 
               over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.

               Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over 
               and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.

               Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.

               Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands 
               reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEP'S PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns 
               jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at 
               them, -- HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts 
               to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.

</b>
               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just 
               ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.

               O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next 
               to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of 
               the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs 
               scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send 
               shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.

               Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and 
               Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then 
               they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.

               Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully 
               looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels 
               her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft 
               of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A 
               MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards 
               him.

               Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF 
               HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, 
               she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around 
               It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.

               Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is 
               down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, 
               her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.

               And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson, 
               Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.

</b>
               O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of 
               CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly 
               trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and 
               help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as 
               the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through 
               him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels 
               Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already 
               running, races right past them. The others turn and haul 
               ass.

<b>               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Imhotep steps forward, -- the sand around him seems to 
               MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal 
               legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns

               Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because 
               HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the 
               ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a 
               big game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his 
               fetid lips, -- A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.

               Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying 
               around the corner and runs right up to her.

               O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, -- at

               O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.

               Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering 
               his prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts 
               to crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops 
               and UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches 
               to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial 
<b>               SHRIEK.

               Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his 
               fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him --

               Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the 
               SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his 
               ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.

               SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn 
               stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN 
               ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell

<b>               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT
</b>
               Beni slowly backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He 
               turns around, -- IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs 
               away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but 
               have no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the 
               back wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless.

               Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten 
               mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his 
               side. Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his 
               neck, RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain.

               Beni holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly 
               makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:

<b>                                     BENI
</b>                         May the good Lord protect and watch 
                         over me as a shepherd watches over 
                         his flock. And may Satan in all his 
                         forms be vanquished forever.

               It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni 
               quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them 
               out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his 
               progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a 
               Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.

               All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and 
               Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for 
               Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.

               And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses 
               himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand 
               lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP

               Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.

                         rewards will be great.

               Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out 
               his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes, 
               about to throw up, but then the maggots part, -- revealing a 
               tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises 
               his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.

               O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself.

               O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.

               Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.

               O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking

               Imhotep a look as he strides off.

               The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and 
               hard liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a 
               walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers.

               He wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.

               The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to 
               O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.

                         around here, rotting from boredom 
                         and booze!

               Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods 
               Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.

               Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment.

                         As you see, I won't be needing them.

               Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He 
               puts the bifocals on over his death mask, -- and grins 
               broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.

                         your eyes,... and for your tongue.

               The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.

                         your friends have brought down upon 
                         yourselves.

               A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly 
               backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the 
               sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing 
               his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.

               Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of 
               books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops 
               half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and 
               drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.

               And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the 
               courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain 
               bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell 
               and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and 
               CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.

               The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.

               O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM 
               is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.

               O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.

<b>               INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY

               O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant 
               who is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they 
               spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, -- 
<b>               HIS BODY IS SHRIVELED TO HALF IT'S SIZE.

               Drained of all organs and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are 
               shocked. Then they hear a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep 
               standing on the far side of the room. O'Connell draws his 
               gun.

               Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful 
               new musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and 
               REFORM. His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and 
               CRIES OUT, in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks 
               like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell.

               The 'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.

               Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.

               Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep 
               Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.

               Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're 
               all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.

               O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep 
               in the face, -- HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEP'S SKULL AND 
               GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, 
               shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of 
               Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist 
               quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as 
               if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.

               Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, 
               THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others 
               knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that 
               just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.

               He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, 
               terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.

               He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.

               And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins 
               into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.

               Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.

               O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns. Ardeth 
               Ray just scowls. The Curator nods his head.

               Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the 
               door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room 
               we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.

               O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.

               away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.

               A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred 
               canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's 
               Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and 
               catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; 
               his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a 
               huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight 
               up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.

               The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread 
               throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.

               O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked.

               Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at 
               the front gate. More Soldiers march the encircling parapet.

<b>               INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT
</b>
               Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair 
               next to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with 
               fear.

                         downstairs to get me a drink. You 
                         want somethin'?

<b>                                     HENDERSON
</b>                         Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a 
                         shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

               Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone, 
               smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his 
               SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes 
               in through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson 
               gets up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.

               The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS 
               Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.

               Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.

               His body TWISTS and TURNS and slowly SHRIVELS as the life is 
               SUCKED out of him.

               Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the wall above him, the 
               SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses, forming a SHADOW of a 
               human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the body REGENERATES.

               And then it's over.

               Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and 
               looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps 
               over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door, 
               rattles the knob. It's locked. Imhotep grins.

<b>               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in 
               through the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large 
               mound. Evelyn starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO 
               THE DOOR: The mound of sand is gone and in it's place is 
               Imhotep.

</b>
               O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a 
               stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.

               O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob, 
               still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.

<b>               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she 
               sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.

               Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth 
               instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the 
               bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes up. Sees Imhotep's 
               rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.

               Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.

</b>                         Get your hands off my girl, pal.

               Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
               O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Nice lips.

               Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         I figured you might be here, so I 
                         brought a friend.

               He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively 
               catches it.

               He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back towards the 
               window, -- which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep spins like a 
               dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.

               Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES 
               out the window and vanishes over the compound.

               Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.

               O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.

               Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on the 
               floor... and drops the martini glasses.

               Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets, 
               HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell, 
               looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.

               They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.

               A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling 
               with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins 
               to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people 
               begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a 
               severe sickness -- it's already too late.

               Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted 
               off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his 
               side, looking very nervous.

               And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow 
               Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS

</b>                         Last month I came across an 
                         inscription that mentioned The Book 
                         Of The Dead.

</b>                         Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked 
                         about bringing people back from the 
                         dead. A notion I was unwilling to

                         apocalypse.

               The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the

               The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.

               Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the 
               car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them 
               overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, 
               CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before 
               they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He 
               TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a 
               corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing 
               several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! 
               CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like 
               rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.

               The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them 
               and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down 
               his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, 
               and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He 
               holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through 
               his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

               WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased 
               mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...

<b>               INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT
</b>
               The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE 
               DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to 
               O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.

               All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.

               Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the 
               windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses 
               control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

               They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob 
               quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his 
               gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into 
               his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way 
               to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth 
               Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the 
               lit match near the fuse.

               The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring 
               at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.

               And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, 
               he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did 
               the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.

</b>                         He's gorgeous.

               O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He 
               YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it 
               across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives 
               O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.

<b>                                     THE CURATOR
</b>                         He has consummated the curse, now 
                         all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun 
                         from the dead, then it will be the 
                         end of us, and the beginning for 
                         them.

               Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell 
               LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops, 
               watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The 
               tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the 
               stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward 
               and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on 
               Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.

               Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.

</b>                         Take his hand and he will spare the 
                         others.

               Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty 
               crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, 
               waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, 
               powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.

<b>                                     EVELYN

               O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.

</b>                         Sorry, fresh out.

               Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to 
               take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, -- 
               but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Don't do it, Evelyn.

</b>                         I have no choice.

               Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes 
               around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.

                         to make you mine, forever.

               Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him --

               Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.

<b>                                     EVELYN
</b>                         You better think of something, because

                         the first one I'm coming after.

               O'Connell almost smiles.

               Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and --

               Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.

               O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of 
               Ardeth Ray's grip.

                         stop him yet.

               The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep 
               stops and looks back at O'Connell.

               Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's 
               grip and stumbles forward.

               But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.

               O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE 
               COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after 
               him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole.

               The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth 
               Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator 
               apart.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the 
               watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a 
               LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then 
               more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.

               O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead 
               of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby 
               fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.

               FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.

               Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set 
               of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with

                         nothing.

               Then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.

<b>               INT. BIPLANE - DAY

               The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in 
               the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle 
               across the left wing, Ardeth Ray is tied tight to the right.

               Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.

               Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size, 
               he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. -- And 
               a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert

<b>               BIPLANE - DAY
</b>
               O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise 
               up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees 
               what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the 
               plane into a dive.

<b>                                     WINSTON

               WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting 
               biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.

               O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT 
               FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.

               O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and 
               FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the 
               sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw 
               unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.

               Winston blindly fights for control, elated.

               The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING. 
               Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston 
               Havlock LAUGHING.

               O'Connell braces himself for impact,

               Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.

</b>                         Stop it! You'll kill them!

               Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare 
               into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.

               Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes 
               herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.

<b>               EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY
</b>
               The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside-
               down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls 
               out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed 
               into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.

<b>                         TROUBLE!!
</b>
               O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to 
               the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's 
               mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a 
               cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell 
               and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.

               A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the 
               sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and 
               look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides 
               away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane 
               vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND...

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the 
               volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.

               Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make 
               their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading 
               into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.

<b>               NECROPOLIS - DAY
</b>
               Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She 
               stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through 
               the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his 
               rifle into her back and pushes her forward.

                         comeuppance.

               Beni suddenly looks worried.

               Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on 
               his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the 
               disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.

<b>               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
               O'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed 
               doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         I say, look at that.

               He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in 
               his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to 
               glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         Say, gents! You should come have a 
                         look at this.

               The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the 
               scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into 
               Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.

               O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The 
               scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips 
               out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's 
               arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in 
               front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being 
               cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.

               The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying 
               back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

               O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM!

<b>               INT. CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
               The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and 
               Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years 
               ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.

               Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC 
               JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's 
               heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading 
               from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a 
               mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.

               Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.

               TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking 
               mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests.

               They bow to Imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway.

                         off the furniture, got it?

               Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously.

<b>               INT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni 
               holds his gun on her, translating:

<b>                                     BENI
</b>                         Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

               Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.

                         that it's already taken.

               Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel 
               encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.

               Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.

</b>                         You only want me for my organs?!

               Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her -- WAP!

               Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold, 
               malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums.

               Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.

<b>               TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and 
               drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his 
               gunnysack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan 
               and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him.

               O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting 
               through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a 
               wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his 
               gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning 
               the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And WHAM! THE SHAFT 
<b>               OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM

               It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing. 
               Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.

               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless. That's 
               when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.

               O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.

               BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.

               O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips 
               through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy, 
               blows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.

               The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the 
               loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.

               And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning 
               over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.

               crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage

               where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two 
               more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More 
               mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of 
               the piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes.

               O'Connell lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Ray stops him.

               Ardeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit 
               out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now.

               O'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING 
               as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies 
               and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.

               Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at 
               all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels

               Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray 
               FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty.

               He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into --

<b>               HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               -- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of 
               HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         There he is!

               They run up to the base of the statue,

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         Hello Horus old boy.

               O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the 
               passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a 
               stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder.

<b>                                     ARDETH RAY
</b>                         Allow me.

               O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to 
               look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes 
               the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.

               Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the 
               passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.

               Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing 
               the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way 
               out, -- another dark, creepy passageway.

<b>               INT. CEMETERY
</b>
               Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly 
               struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start 
               surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous 
               mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds 
               even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths 
               in the room.

               Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His 
               hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed 
               cheek.

<b>               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the 
               secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth 
               Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the 
               dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.

</b>                         These guys just don't quit.

               Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells 
               and runs off towards the mummies.

<b>                                     ARDETH RAY
</b>                         Keep digging!

               O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder 
               on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.

               The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?

               Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts...

               And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND 
               and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST 
               up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with 
               the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.

               One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another 
               grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A 
               third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.

<b>               AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL 
</b>               THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in 
               the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

</b>
               Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.

               A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.

<b>               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               Ardeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the 
               base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate 
               chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the 
               lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.

               He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he 
               reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD 
               Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces 
               as they stare at it in wonder.

               The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel 
               and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.

<b>                                     ARDETH RAY
</b>                         Save the girl! Kill the creature!

               The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.

               O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it 
               against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.

                         lucky.

               The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, -- but now here's a hole 
               for them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through 
               the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.

<b>               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY

               Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled 
               with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.

               Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.

               Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him 
               and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the 
               door.

<b>               INT. CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
               Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock 
               back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.

               Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling 
               hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and 
               into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.

               The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.

               The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and 
               IMHOTEP'S READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty 
               EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.

               Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with 
               empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then 
               she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.

<b>                                     IMHOTEP

                         be invincible!

               He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.

               Evelyn's eyes widen in horror. And that's when O'Connell and 
               Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.

               Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.

</b>                         Shut-up and get me off of here!

               O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand, 
               jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.

               The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.

               Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial 
               knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests 
               stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.

                         him!

               O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies, 
               fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly 
               SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan fumbles 
               with the book, struggling to open it, -- he can't.

               O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his 
               sword down at Evelyn, -- CLANG! One chain breaks free.

               Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS along 
               the binder. It hits him like lightning --

               Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain 
               around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket 
               He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.

               O'Connell swings his sword down again, -- CLANG! Evelyn now 
               has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell 
               force him back.

               Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription, 
               but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.

</b>                         Keetash-something, naraba-something.

               Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching 
               the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

               Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.

               O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding 
               Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.

<b>                                     JONATHAN

               Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.

               And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES 
               through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen. Only better.

               The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares 
               angrily down. Jonathan stares back.

</b>                         Oh boy.

               O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.

</b>                         This just keeps gettin, better and 
                         better.

               Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.

               O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, 
               frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, 
               forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to 
               head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her 
               around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.

               Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in 
               ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for 
               O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus 
               moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.

               Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best 
               she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on 
               the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure --

               Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis 
               corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's 
               MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares 
               at the inscription, slightly oblivious.

                         a stork! on either side.

               Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun.

</b>                         Yes,... I see.

               The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.

</b>                         Hootash im Ahmenophus!

               The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks 
               and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell 
               slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, 
               Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream 
               just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to 
               powder and DRIVING her into the ground.

               Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily 
               heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly 
               backpedals on his hands and heels.

               O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for 
               Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden 
               Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall.

               O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP!

               SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still 
               clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and 
               spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.

                         are without your right arm.

               Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him 
               half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a 
               gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes 
               it off.

               Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up 
               his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.

               Evelyn runs for Jonathan.

               O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten 
               flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep 
               looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.

               Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.

               O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS 
               him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,

               SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage 
               in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS 
               into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in 
               the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with 
               him.

               He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.

               Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.

               Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed 
               hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn 
               yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working 
               the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.

               Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, 
               swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES 
               through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.

               No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and 
               casually flings it away.

               The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan 
               holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages 
               looking for something.

               O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat 
               and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed 
               mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, 
               then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About 
               to die.

               Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:

<b>                                     EVELYN
</b>                         Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! 
<b>                         PARED OOS!!
</b>
               Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror 
               on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which 
               starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.

               And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out 
               of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The 
               mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits 
               attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.

               Imhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.

               Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, 
               Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of 
               The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden 
               book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like 
               he's about to cry.

               Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's 
               body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.

               Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the 
               beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One 
               last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep 
               is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, 
               he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.

               O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword 
               scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across 
               Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the 
               blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.

               O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him 
               backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus 
               bog. The sword still in his stomach.

               Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as 
               Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And 
               then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at 
               them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

               Evelyn translates:

<b>                                     EVELYN
</b>                         Death is only the beginning.

               Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile.

<b>               STAFF CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight 
               of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large, 
               ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag 
               over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.

               A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF 
               DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.

               Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.

               ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons 
               of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber.

<b>               CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls 
               start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         C'mon!

               He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking 
               pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.

<b>               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</b>
               Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower 
               and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick 
               the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees.

<b>               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure 
               chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the 
               treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again 
               and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards 
               a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of 
               the sinking walls is deafening.

               Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn 
               and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a 
               staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already 
               half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet 
               high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.

               Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives, 
               but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.

               O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of 
               time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --

<b>                                     BENI
</b><b>                         O'CONNELL!!
</b>
               O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand 
               back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.

               Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as 
               the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks 
               around with his diminishing torch.

               All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's 
               trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over 
               in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.

               Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.

<b>                                     BENI
</b>                         Go away.

               He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens 
               upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.

               Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.

               And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.

               And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.

               And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.

<b>               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY
</b>
               The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a 
               pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE 
               DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the 
               front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.

               They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind 
               them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the 
               wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels 
               race out into the desert...

<b>               EXT. PLATEAU - DAY
</b>
               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the 
               plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the 
               sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

<b>                                     JONATHAN
</b>                         Well,... I guess we go home empty 
                         handed.

               O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL
</b>                         Wouldn't say that.

               Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms 
               around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.

               Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs 
               up onto a camel.

               When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, 
               then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs 
               Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her 
               arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.

<b>                                     O'CONNELL/JONATHAN

               The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag 
               behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can 
               see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.

               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.
