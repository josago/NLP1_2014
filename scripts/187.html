<br>
<br>1   EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN SKYLINE - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING    1
<br>    RUSH HOUR
<br>
<br>    ON a pair of black Dexter penny loafers diligently
<br>    pedaling an old Schwinn mountain bike. ADJUST ANGLE now
<br>    to meet the bicyclist...
<br>
<br>    He's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears
<br>    wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased
<br>    slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at
<br>    once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass
<br>    on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD.
<br>
<br>    ADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade
<br>    bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind
<br>    him. Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers.
<br>
<br>    Trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft.
<br>    above the East River.
<br>
<br>    A fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks
<br>    back and forth as he pumps the pedals.
<br>
<br>    FROM ABOVE now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the
<br>    bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour
<br>    traffic on the bridge below.
<br>
<br>
<br>2   EXT. ATLANTIC AVENUE (BEDFORD STUYVESANT) - MORNING         2
<br>
<br>    A wrought-iron train trestle covered with graffiti shakes
<br>    as an "EL" TRAIN ROARS overhead. Trevor races parallel
<br>    with it along Atlantic Avenue. Every city block becomes
<br>    more and more rundown.
<br>
<br>
<br>3   EXT. ROOSEVELT WHITNEY HIGH SCHOOL (BEDFORD                 3
<br>    STUYVESANT) - MORNING
<br>
<br>    A cyclone fence frames the stalwart face of the old
<br>    three-story administration building. Ubiquitous gray
<br>    patches of paint fail to cover where taggers have most
<br>    recently left their marks. The ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, a
<br>    black man with a booming voice, barks at late-comers who
<br>    are about to be tardy...
<br>
<br>                            ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL
<br>                     (clapping his hands)
<br>              ... Let's go, people! Tardy lock-
<br>              out starts in one minute! Get
<br>              your butts in gear! One minute,
<br>              people! Move it!

<br>     SUPERIMPOSE:    ROOSEVELT WHITNEY HIGH SCHOOL -
<br>                     OCTOBER 1994
<br>
<br>     The Assistant Principal, attention diverted, doesn't even
<br>     notice Trevor as he enters on his bike and races down the
<br>     sidewalk in front of the school. With all the prompting,
<br>     students still don't seem to be in much of a hurry.

<br>     ... as Trevor squeezes through the doorway past students
<br>     being processed through card readers and metal detectors
<br>     and turns down the main hall.

<br>
<br>6    INT. RWHS - MAIN FLOOR                                          6
<br>
<br>     With a glance over his shoulder, Trevor hops back onto
<br>     his bike and pedals it down the middle of the corridor.
<br>     STRAGGLING STUDENTS either ignore him or look at him
<br>     like he's insane.
<br>
<br>                                STRAGGLING STUDENT
<br>                         (as Trevor passes)
<br>                  ... No ridin' bikes in 'a hallway,

<br>     As Trevor reaches the end of the main corridor... and
<br>     steers his bike down the stairs.

<br>
<br>7    INT. RWHS - BOTTOM FLOOR                                        7
<br>
<br>     Trevor coasts skillfully down the stairs and emerges
<br>     onto the bottom floor of the school. He pedals away
<br>     toward the other end of the corridor.
<br>
<br>
<br>7A   EXT. TREVOR'S CLASSROOM                                         7A
<br>
<br>     A crowd of 10th graders loiter outside Trevor's room.
<br>     Seeing him coming, they stir to life with a flurry of
<br>     taunts. Trevor chooses to face all dissension with a
<br>     smile.
<br>

<br>
<br>     As Trevor hops off his bike and unlocks the classroom
<br>     door, he notices two lovers making out in the hallway...
<br>
<br>                                VOICE IN CROWD
<br>                  ... Yuh late, Garfield.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                         (catching his breath)
<br>                  ... No, bell hasn't rung yet.
<br>                  Okay, let's get inside. C'mon.
<br>                         (as they file
<br>                          into the room)
<br>                  ... Morning, morning. Rise and
<br>                  shine.
<br>
<br>     TWO STUDENTS make passing comments...
<br>
<br>                                AUGGIE
<br>                         (shaking his head)
<br>                  ... You one crazy-ass nigga, G.
<br>
<br>                                TYWAN
<br>                         (a quarter stuck
<br>                          in one ear)
<br>                  ... Damn skippy.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  Thank you for sharing, Auggie.
<br>
<br>                                TYWAN
<br>                         (provoking Auggie)
<br>                  ... Auggie doggie.
<br>
<br>                                AUGGIE (O.S.)
<br>                  Fuck you, Tywan. Yer mama's a
<br>                  gangsta-rapper.
<br>
<br>     Trevor offers a pleasant greeting to the two lovers.
<br>

<br>                  'Scuse me, you two... this isn't
<br>                  the Playboy Channel.
<br>
<br>     Trevor enters the room, but ducks his head back into
<br>     the hall.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR

<br>
<br>     Walls are covered with assorted science posters.
<br>     Styrofoam nuclei dangle from the ceiling. Trevor
<br>     unstraps the fat briefcase from his bicycle and sets
<br>     it on a metal stool next to his desk...

<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                        (enthusiastically)
<br>                 Let's get started. August and
<br>                 Tywan, you pass out the books.
<br>                 Thank you, gentlemen.
<br>
<br>    Auggie and Tywan don't budge.
<br>
<br>                                TYWAN
<br>                 Whas up wit' your car, G?   Yer
<br>                 Pinto blow up?
<br>
<br>    The majority of students aren't even paying attention.          A
<br>    group in the back is already starting a card game.
<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                        (good-natured smile)
<br>                 No, I don't own a Pinto, Tywan.
<br>                        (addressing the class)
<br>                 Okay, can I have everyone's
<br>                 attention?
<br>
<br>    No response, but it doesn't phase Trevor.         He removes
<br>    the front wheels from his bike.
<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                 The purpose of the bicycle is to
<br>                 demonstrate the principle of
<br>                 centripetal force. That's the
<br>                 opposite of the force we studied
<br>                 yesterday, which was...
<br>
<br>                                 VOICE IN THE CROWD
<br>                 Magnum force.
<br>
<br>    Hoots and laughter.
<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                 Centrifugal force... Centripetal
<br>                 force is where the acceleration of
<br>                 a body moving in circular motion
<br>                 is directed toward its center by an
<br>                 opposing force, thus creating
<br>                 momentum that constrains the body to
<br>                 its circular path. Like a gyroscope.
<br>                        (sees nothing
<br>                         but yawns)
<br>                 It's better if I show you. Here,
<br>                 Tywan, you be my helper.
<br>
<br>    Tywan and Auggie are busy talking in the corner.        They
<br>    still haven't passed out the books.
<br>

<br>                 Tywan?   Come on.
<br>
<br>    Tywan, solidly built like a Rodin bronze, saunters over.
<br>
<br>                               TYWAN
<br>                 Whad-up, G?
<br>                        (to rest of class)
<br>                 Hey, shut up! Y'all too damn
<br>                 loud, man!
<br>
<br>    Class quiets but only marginally.
<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                 I need you to demonstrate
<br>                 centripetal force.
<br>                        (removes briefcase
<br>                         from stool)
<br>                 Here, have a seat.
<br>
<br>    Tywan sits and Trevor hands him the upside-down bicycle.
<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                 Okay, hold the bike steady with
<br>                 your knees. That's it. Seat
<br>                 positioned against your chest.
<br>
<br>    Tywan glances over at Auggie and starts to laugh.
<br>
<br>                               TYWAN
<br>                        (to Auggie)
<br>                 Shut up, foo.
<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                 Okay, now crank the pedals and get
<br>                 that back wheel spinning about
<br>                 180 R.P.M.
<br>
<br>                               TYWAN
<br>                 Whas up wit' dat?

<br>                        (coaxing him along)
<br>                 You'll see. Be patient.
<br>
<br>    A skeptical Tywan starts to crank the pedals, but he's
<br>    not pedaling hard enough.
<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                 ... Put some muscle into it.
<br>
<br>    Tywan cranks the pedals harder now. Trevor back-pedals
<br>    over to the textbook shelf and randomly selects a
<br>    physical science book (but doesn't open it).

<br>                 ... Keep pedaling. Harder.
<br>
<br>    A paper airplane sails past an oblivious Tywan. He
<br>    cranks harder and harder until he's sweating ham juice.
<br>    Now, he impales Trevor with a befuddled squint.
<br>
<br>                               TYWAN
<br>                        (incredulous)
<br>                 Whas up? I tol' you you was
<br>                 crazy, man.
<br>
<br>    A thin smile of confidence from Trevor now...
<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                 Now tilt the wheel to your right.
<br>
<br>    Tywan does and immediately the wheel pulls him to the
<br>    right, causing the stool to slowly spin on its axis.
<br>
<br>                               TYWAN
<br>                        (eyes wide like
<br>                         a little kid)
<br>                 Aw, damn. I'm spinnin'.   Lookit
<br>                 me, Auggie!
<br>
<br>    Trevor flickers a smile as Tywan's spinning starts to
<br>    draw the attention of the rest of the class.
<br>
<br>    Now Trevor refers to the physical science book in his
<br>    hand. Smile on his face immediately fades.
<br>
<br>    INSERT: Physical science textbook. In magic marker.
<br>    The large number 187 has been scrawled across every
<br>    page. Trevor flips through the book. He checks the
<br>    front page to see who it belongs to.
<br>
<br>    Juxtaposed to Trevor's distracted state, the class is now
<br>    focused on Tywan's achievement...

<br>    One of the fluorescent lights overhead flickers. The
<br>    place is deserted except for a custodian who pushes a
<br>    cresting wave of trash ahead of his broom. Now Trevor
<br>    heads up the north stairwell at the far end of the
<br>    corridor. He clutches the desecrated physical science
<br>    book. A student slides down the banister past him.
<br>

<br>11   INT. COUNSELING OFFICES - WAITING AREA                       11
<br>
<br>     A PUERTO RICAN WOMAN prods a group of gangbanger wanna-
<br>     bes. Two of the teens hover over a Sony Walkman, sharing
<br>     the earphones.
<br>
<br>                             SECRETARY
<br>               Okay, fellas, off the table. Put
<br>               the Walkman away. I said put it
<br>               away...
<br>
<br>     A 10th grade counselor's office opens and a student
<br>     emerges. Trevor walks directly in.
<br>
<br>                             TREVOR
<br>               Walter, I need to speak with you.
<br>
<br>     WALTER (Anglo; 52) is a disheveled middle-aged counselor.
<br>     A lifer. He chews on an empty smoking pipe as he glances
<br>     through a student "cum" (cue-mm).
<br>
<br>                             WALTER
<br>                      (preoccupied)
<br>               I'm pretty busy right now,
<br>               Garfield. What is it?
<br>
<br>     Trevor sets the book down on Walter's desk and nervously
<br>     adjusts his glasses.
<br>
<br>                             TREVOR
<br>               Could you open it, please?
<br>
<br>     Walter opens the book.
<br>
<br>                             WALTER
<br>                      (a weary look
<br>                       of disgust)
<br>               Don't suppose this kid cares about
<br>               our budget crisis?
<br>                      (shuts the book)
<br>               Have the textbook room charge him
<br>               for the book.
<br>
<br>     Walter snaps the book shut and looks up at Trevor.
<br>     That's all?
<br>
<br>                             TREVOR
<br>               One-Eight-Seven is a penal code
<br>               number for murder, Walter.
<br>               Means the same thing as T-O-S.
<br>               'Terminate On the Spot.'
<br>
<br>                                                    (CONTINUED)

<br>                                 WALTER
<br>                         (piqued)
<br>                  For chrissake, I know what it
<br>                  stands for. Look, kid probably
<br>                  heard it in a rap song. Doesn't
<br>                  mean anything.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  ... The book belongs to Dennis
<br>                  Broadway. He's a known gangster,
<br>                  Walter -- a 'Five Percenter.'
<br>
<br>                                WALTER
<br>                  Garfield, if I had a dollar for
<br>                  every time a student threatened
<br>                  faculty... Don't you think you're
<br>                  overreacting a little?
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                         (suppressing
<br>                          trepidation)
<br>                  Did you tell Dennis Broadway he
<br>                  was getting a fail from me?
<br>
<br>                                WALTER
<br>                         (stymied)
<br>                  I have legal access to those
<br>                  files.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  He's a transfer from Nixon High
<br>                  School, isn't he?
<br>
<br>                                WALTER
<br>                         (becoming defensive)
<br>                  Look, I'm not obligated to track
<br>                  you down every time a transfer
<br>                  student comes through here. You
<br>                  want confidential information
<br>                  like that, come look it up in his
<br>                  cum (cue-mm).
<br>
<br>     Trevor exhales a sigh of resignation.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  Do you have him on a contract?
<br>
<br>                                WALTER
<br>                  If he gets through the semester
<br>                  without a fail then he gets to go
<br>                  back to Nixon, so what?
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  ... and be with his homeboys.

<br>
<br>     Walter's caught between a rock and a hard place.   His
<br>     instincts lean toward self-preservation.
<br>
<br>                                WALTER
<br>                  So he blew his opportunity. Now
<br>                  he has to learn to live with the
<br>                  consequences.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  I don't think this kid's ready to
<br>                  deal with the consequences. I
<br>                  think he wants me dead.
<br>
<br>                                WALTER
<br>                  Relax, has nothin' to do with you.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  I should have been told, Walter.
<br>
<br>                                WALTER
<br>                  Hey, I'm on your side, Garfield,
<br>                  but my hands are tied. Kid has a
<br>                  right to his privacy... Know what
<br>                  your problem is? You're an
<br>                  idealist.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  What's wrong with that?
<br>
<br>                                WALTER
<br>                  You only see what you wanna see,
<br>                  that's what's wrong. On one hand
<br>                  you think someone's trying to kill
<br>                  you. On the other hand you
<br>                  actually believe kids are paying
<br>                  attention in your classes.
<br>
<br>     Trevor resigns himself to the fact that he's come to
<br>     the wrong person for support.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                         (collecting himself)
<br>                  Never mind. It's not a problem.
<br>
<br>                                WALTER
<br>                         (an empty promise)
<br>                  Tell you what, as soon as I get a
<br>                  chance I'll summons the kid.
<br>                  Promise.
<br>
<br>     Trevor's bemusement holds us.

<br>
<br>12   INT. RWHS "A" BUILDING - MAIN CORRIDOR - MORNING            12
<br>
<br>     Trevor retraces his steps back up the empty corridor as
<br>     the passing BELL RINGS. Within seconds the corridor is
<br>     teeming with teenagers.
<br>
<br>     Into SLOW MOTION now. MANEUVERING THROUGH the crowd to
<br>     DISCOVER DENNIS BROADWAY (16). About ten paces behind.
<br>     His Snoop-Dogg Afro frames a gold earring and a pair of
<br>     deep-set eyes filled with vitriol. Oblivious of Dennis,
<br>     Trevor presses on toward the north stairwell.
<br>
<br>     VARIOUS SHOTS OVERHEAD and THROUGH crowd as the gap
<br>     between Dennis and Trevor narrows. Every facial
<br>     expression, every blink of an eye, all magnified a
<br>     hundred times.
<br>
<br>     Broadway's right hand is wrapped in a dirty white
<br>     handkerchief as he reaches into the front pocket of his
<br>     baggie Solos and pulls out a block of wood with a
<br>     ten-penny nail imbedded in it.
<br>
<br>
<br>13   INT. RWHS - AT NORTH STAIRWELL                              13
<br>
<br>     Trevor's heavy eyelids blink as he slowly glances up into
<br>     a parabolic mirror on the wall. A silent, paroxysmal
<br>     terror registers on his face.
<br>
<br>     In a parabolic mirror, the blurred image of Dennis
<br>     Broadway, pushing hard toward a conclusion now.
<br>
<br>     BACK TO SPEED as Dennis explodes forward, body blocking
<br>     Trevor from behind, pinning him against a wall and
<br>     sending the "187" textbook flying.
<br>
<br>     He rams his weapon into Trevor's back.
<br>
<br>     In a SERIES OF RAPID-FIRE CUTS, filtered sunlight
<br>     shimmers off the sharpened nail as it slashes downward.
<br>     A barrage of stabbing motions, tearing at cloth and
<br>     flesh. Trevor's backward flailing arms are ineffective
<br>     in blocking the frenzied stabfest. Downward slashing,
<br>     again and again... 10 times.
<br>
<br>     Aftermath. As quickly as it began it's over. Dennis
<br>     Broadway slams open an exit door and is gone. Students
<br>     scatter like cockroaches. An eerie stillness lingers.
<br>
<br>     Trevor Garfield is lying on his back now in a pool of
<br>     blood; black plastic framed glasses in pieces on the
<br>     floor; lifeless arms spread out at his sides.   His
<br>     rheumy, unblinking eyes stare upward into infinite space.
<br>     Breathing is the major focus of his concentration now as
<br>     we SLOWLY MOVE IN ON his face. HOLD and now...
<br>
<br>                                                               11.

<br>     SEVENTEEN MONTHS LATER
<br>
<br>     It's a tiny one bedroom house in the East San Fernando
<br>     Valley. A chain-link fence surrounds the perimeter and a
<br>     large olive tree shades the neatly-mowed front lawn.
<br>     And in the back there's a wooden tool shed that borders
<br>     a narrow alley.

<br>
<br>     Stillness. Now the PHONE RINGS. A shape in the bed
<br>     stirs. A desk lamp flickers on, illuminating the phone.
<br>     Trevor's hand reaches for the receiver.
<br>
<br>                                 TREVOR
<br>                   Morning...

<br>                   'Morning, Mr. Garfield. This is

<br>                   There's a science class in the
<br>                   Valley at John Quincy Adams. It's

<br>     A)   IN SHOWER
<br>
<br>          Trevor hangs his head under a torrent of soothing
<br>          water.
<br>
<br>     B)   TREVOR
<br>
<br>          Ceremoniously, he irons a shirt... and polishes his
<br>          shoes, a broad scar shows across the back of his hand.

<br>
<br>           His pressed slacks and tie hang meticulously over a
<br>           chair as he gets dressed.
<br>
<br>      D)   CRUCIFIX
<br>
<br>           Now Jesus Christ looks down on Trevor from his crucifix

<br>
<br>      Traffic bottle-necks as students cross in front of cars,
<br>      and big yellow L.A.U.S.D. buses pull in. The green lawn
<br>      is scattered with students (about 65% Hispanic).
<br>      Compared to the scarred, institutional look of Roosevelt
<br>      Whitney, the face of John Quincy Adams is unblemished.
<br>      (This is your own backyard, not the inner city)

<br>      Sagging pants (Dickies, Ben Davis) and oversized jackets

<br>     MINUTES LATER
<br>
<br>     Trevor, fat briefcase in hand, crosses the front lawn.
<br>     He's not the same Trevor we met back in Bedford-
<br>     Stuvyesant. Withdrawn, guarded, he manufactures a
<br>     cautious smile at students in passing.
<br>
<br>     Trevor now approaches VICTOR SIFUENTES, a young plain-
<br>     clothes narc, who intermittently wands students with a
<br>     metal detector at the front doors. FAVOR a kid now who
<br>     wears a baseball cap with an emblem on the crown that
<br>     says "Fucd."

<br>     Trevor wanders up the crowded corridor. Along with his
<br>     briefcase he now carries a sub folder that contains a
<br>     homeroom roster, lesson plans and seating charts.
<br>
<br>     A sporadic row of teachers, like weary sentinels, stand
<br>     outside their classrooms.

<br>     TEACHER #1 is an insipid woman in her mid-forties.   She's

<br>     Now we see her through the doorway. ELLEN HENRY (TEACHER
<br>     #3). She's thirty, Anglo, and non-tenured. At the front
<br>     of the class ten students stand linked together, arm-in-
<br>     arm, in a human chain. WILLIAM (15) sits behind a computer
<br>     in the front row struggling to decipher the problem...
<br>
<br>                                ELLEN

<br>                  How 'bout Binary search.
<br>
<br>     William remains puzzled. The chain of students delight
<br>     in chiding him. "C'mon, Beavis!"...

<br>     Ellen attempts to bisect the impulsive chain of students
<br>     with a double-handed karate chop. Fickle chain that they
<br>     are, they resist.

<br>     Increasing evidence of tagging, and bands of wandering
<br>     students, indicate a higher degree of disorder the
<br>     further one gets from the Main Office.
<br>
<br>     FROM ABOVE NOW, like Algernon and his maze, Trevor
<br>     negotiates his own path deeper and deeper into the
<br>     configuration of bungalows.
<br>
<br>     ... And Trevor's trepidation. Eyes discerning every

<br>     SHIFTING INTO SLOW MOTION AGAIN... And the reverberating
<br>     SOUND of a SPRAY PAINT MARBLE as Trevor rounds a corner
<br>     and comes face to face with three tag-bangers concealing
<br>     spray paint cans inside their oversized jackets. One of
<br>     the taggers locks eyes with Trevor as he passes, a slow
<br>     premonitory burn. The tagger has a "skin tight" (pelon)
<br>     hair cut and a string of black rosary beads around his

<br>     fies BENNY.

<br>     The residual effects of a hangover linger as he sneaks a
<br>     cigarette before first period. He wears a faded Hawaiian
<br>     shirt and Huarache sandals. An old military tattoo
<br>     emblazons his left forearm. As he crushes out his

<br>
<br>     Homeboys scatter in all directions, some hop the chain-
<br>     link fence, others scurry out a narrow gate behind the
<br>     shed. Childress weighs an amused smirk. Now out of
<br>     nowhere a gangbanger lurches from the shed, buttoning
<br>     his sagging Dickies and tripping over his own feet. He
<br>     scrambles out the back gate and is gone.
<br>
<br>     Childress, curiosity piqued, now enters the compound
<br>     through a tear in the fence.

<br>     shirt on over her head. Glances up at Childress. Masks

<br>     walls and closed venetian blinds. His breathing's
<br>     slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase. His back
<br>     faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes
<br>     a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. Almost instantly his
<br>     breathing returns to normal.
<br>
<br>     Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the
<br>     dormant enthusiasm he used to have. Takes a deep
<br>     cathartic breath. Now he digs a file folder out of his
<br>     briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches
<br>     the blackboard.
<br>
<br>     BELL RINGS as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins.
<br>     First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard.

<br>
<br>     Before Trevor can finish writing the question, an
<br>     unidentified voice blurts out, "He plimped a Ho."
<br>     Scattered laughter. Trevor grimaces, shakes his head.
<br>     Now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the
<br>     sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension.
<br>

<br>
<br>     Trevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers.     A
<br>     startling discovery abruptly halts his search...
<br>
<br>     CLOSER now INTO a brown paper bag Trevor has opened.
<br>     Inside the bag is a .357 Magnum.
<br>
<br>     OFF Trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice
<br>     interrupts...

<br>
<br>     Trevor lifts his head to see Dave Childress standing in
<br>     the doorway of the bungalow. Trevor shuts the desk
<br>     drawer. You can hear a pin drop.
<br>
<br>     Childress piston-chews a wad of gum as he approaches
<br>     Trevor.

<br>
<br>     The bungalow was originally designed for lab science:
<br>     glass-encased cupboards, a caged white lab rat on a side
<br>     counter, an 8' by 3' counter top (island) at the front of
<br>     the room, including a built-in sink and butane gas valve.
<br>
<br>     Students crowd the opened windows on the far side of the
<br>     room. The chaotic atmosphere centers around one
<br>     student... Benny Chacon (18), the tagger we met earlier.
<br>
<br>     Trevor's back to square one. He struggles with
<br>     trepidation as he steps into the doorway of the bungalow
<br>     and hesitates.
<br>
<br>     A young black girl, LAKESIA STEWART (16), stands near the
<br>     doorway. She cradles a realistic looking E.N.A.B.L. baby
<br>     (Education Now And Babies Later).
<br>
<br>                                LAKESIA
<br>                 You our sub?
<br>
<br>     Trevor takes a peek at the doll.

<br>                               LAKESIA
<br>                 It's not real. We're studying
<br>                 teen parenting in home-ec.' It's
<br>                 computerized, so it cries and shit.
<br>
<br>     Crowd at the windows begins to disperse now, finding
<br>     their seats, except for Benny who doesn't budge. Trevor
<br>     approaches, gazes out the window, eyes sizing up the
<br>     situation.

<br>     Benny now finds a seat.      Trevor follows him.

<br>     Class laughs. Trevor refers to the seating chart (inside

<br>     Suddenly three students across from Benny (the other
<br>     three taggers we saw earlier, Cesar Sanchez, Stevie
<br>     Littleton and Paco) stand with bold impunity. All are
<br>     17. Cesar has a buzz-cut, Stevie's an Anglo speed freak

<br>                          empty palms)
<br>                  I don't think so.
<br>
<br>     Trevor looks down at the tagging on Cesar's desktop. In
<br>     one corner are the letters K-O-S, and below that the word
<br>     "cartoon."
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  K-O-S, what's that? That a
<br>                  tagging crew?
<br>
<br>     Cesar shrugs with a big grin.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  Cartoon... Is that you, Cesar?
<br>                         (off no response)
<br>                  'K-O-S' has something to do with
<br>                  your friend Benny?
<br>
<br>                                CESAR
<br>                  ... Dawg. You're a sucker. K-O-S
<br>                  stands for 'Kappin' Off Suckers.'
<br>                  Don't disrespect my homeboy, Benny.
<br>                  He don't like it. He don't like
<br>                  you.
<br>
<br>     Trevor dismisses Cesar's comments.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  Do me a favor, Cesar. Go get a
<br>                  paper towel from the counter and
<br>                  wipe off your desk.
<br>                         (beat)
<br>                  And Mr. Littleton, please oblige
<br>                  me and turn that tagger shirt
<br>                  inside-out.

<br>
<br>     Neither of them budge. Momentous deliberation. Now the
<br>     BELL RINGS and the classroom empties in a matter of
<br>     seconds. Cesar stares daggers at Trevor as he exits.
<br>
<br>     Rita hangs back, the last one to leave.      She doesn't want
<br>     anyone to see her talking to Trevor.

<br>     broken by a BASKETBALL smashing against the side of the
<br>     bungalow.
<br>

<br>     POV - OUT THE WINDOW
<br>
<br>     A group of boys grin mischieviously at the reaction they
<br>     get from Trevor... continue smashing the ball against
<br>     bungalows.
<br>
<br>
<br>     TREVOR

<br>     shifts his gaze from them to the venetian blinds framing
<br>     the window... to the clock over his desk.

<br>     as they open -- revealing the clock -- and just as
<br>     suddenly close. TILT DOWN to find Trevor working the
<br>     cords to the blinds he's rigged over the timeplace.
<br>
<br>     A FAINT KNOCK breaks his spell as he glances up to
<br>     discover Ellen Henry standing in the open doorway.

<br>     Impressed, Ellen peruses the room now with a benign gaze.

<br>     Ellen flickers a grin, point taken.

<br>                                ELLEN
<br>                  I think it takes a lot of

<br>                  classroom after something like
<br>                  that.

<br>     window where the boys play a rough game of BASKETBALL.

<br>                                ELLEN
<br>                  I assume you've met Benny Chacon?

<br>                  Last week Benny and his tagging
<br>                  crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in
<br>                  the corner over there.
<br>                         (pointing)
<br>                  ... She's seven months pregnant
<br>                  and he's tormenting her with a
<br>                  broom handle... Can I help you
<br>                  with those?
<br>
<br>     Trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf,
<br>     but he's having trouble raising his arm high enough.
<br>     Ellen sees he's in pain.

<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  No thanks.

<br>     She watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.
<br>
<br>                                ELLEN
<br>                  So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny...
<br>                  and if the district construes it
<br>                  as assault and battery on a
<br>                  student, she's gone.

<br>                                TREVOR

<br>                  In a heart beat. She's non-
<br>                  tenured, they don't want to get
<br>                  sued...
<br>                          (with resignation)

<br>                  In less than a year he's been
<br>                  convicted of felony assault and
<br>                  suspended twice. I even testified
<br>                  against him as a character witness.
<br>                  Now I get to see him every day in
<br>                  homeroom. I'm stuck with him.
<br>                  Condition of his probation is
<br>                  that he stay in school.

<br>                  weeks ago, my car was broken into...

<br>
<br>     ... Trace the cold underbelly of the overpass. The glare
<br>     of oncoming headlights flash overhead as we DISCOVER a
<br>     tagging wall.
<br>
<br>     CLOSER now...
<br>
<br>     ... The wall is completely covered with graffiti. The
<br>     centerpiece of the wall is a 5' by 10' multi-color
<br>     "placa" that reads...
<br>
<br>                                      K.O.S.
<br>
<br>     ANGLING TO DISCOVER an Anglo tagger now as he defaces
<br>     the "S" in K-O-S, covering it with his own piece.

<br>
<br>     Suddenly the lone tagger feels a presence at his back.
<br>     He freezes. Now slowly turns to see...
<br>
<br>     ... Benny, Cesar and Paco.
<br>
<br>     Merely shadows. Benny lights a blunt, illuminating his
<br>     face. Passes it to Cesar...
<br>
<br>                                   TAGGER
<br>                  Do I know you?
<br>
<br>                                BENNY
<br>                         (indicates tagging)
<br>                  You should. You're fuckin' with
<br>                  my piece, puto.
<br>
<br>                                TAGGER
<br>                         (nervously)
<br>                  ... You from K.O.S.? No shit?
<br>
<br>     Cesar and Paco burst into hysterical laughter which
<br>     only manages to get Benny piqued.
<br>
<br>                                TAGGER
<br>                         (panicking)
<br>                  Look, I didn't mean nothin'. Lemme
<br>                  fix it. I can fix it. Okay?
<br>
<br>     Cesar and Paco laugh harder.
<br>
<br>                                BENNY
<br>                         (to Cesar)
<br>                  Eh, shut up, mojado!
<br>                         (to Tagger now)
<br>                  Don't mess wit' me, whiteboy.    I'll
<br>                  cap yer ass.
<br>
<br>     He pulls a .380 or a .25 automatic out of his pocket.
<br>     Brandishes it at Cesar and Paco...
<br>
<br>                                BENNY
<br>                  I said shut up! Shut the fuck up!
<br>
<br>     A BEEPER hooked on Benny's pants pocket BEEPS. Benny
<br>     shuts it off. The Tagger sees his opportunity and makes
<br>     a break for it. Without a second thought, Benny SHOOTS
<br>     him in the leg. Tagger crumbles to the ground. Benny's
<br>     really pissed now. Checks his beeper's glow-in-the-dark
<br>     face for the message.
<br>
<br>                                BENNY
<br>                         (reacting to message)

<br>     Cesar and Paco attempt to subdue their laughter but
<br>     fail...
<br>
<br>                                BENNY
<br>                  You think it's funny?!
<br>
<br>     Benny lifts a pant leg.    Indicates his ankle monitor with
<br>     the barrel of his gun.
<br>
<br>                                BENNY
<br>                  I don't call my P.O. in 15
<br>                  minutes, I'm fucked.
<br>
<br>     Venting rage, Benny walks up the wounded Tagger and
<br>     STARTS SHOOTING (one hand high near his face, shooting
<br>     downward). Now he kisses the crucifix on his rosary like
<br>     a sick, distorted affectation.
<br>
<br>                                BENNY
<br>                  Dis is K.O.S.' neighborhood.
<br>
<br>     Cesar and Paco laugh even harder now, falling all
<br>     over each other. Benny storms off. He marches past a
<br>     street lamp and is swallowed up by the night.

<br>     SUBJECT CAMERA FOLLOWING Benny. Oblivious that he's

<br>     An eight-year-old Hispanic kid pulls a red Flexi-Flyer
<br>     wagon (laden with pop bottles and aluminum cans) across
<br>     weeds and cracked earth.
<br>
<br>     He suddenly stops and stares at something in the weeds.
<br>     Snatches it up, studies it, and tosses it with everything
<br>     else.
<br>
<br>     SLOWLY MOVING IN ON the wagon now...
<br>
<br>     ... thru a thin shroud of dust as it bangs and bumps
<br>     along.
<br>

<br>     Benny's ankle monitor.

<br>     Trevor emerges from Assistant Principal Ford's office and
<br>     walks up the empty corridor, without breaking stride.

<br>               ... Trevor.
<br>
<br>     Trevor retraces his steps back to the door of Ellen's
<br>     plant-filled, personalized computer lab. Over the
<br>     CLACKING of COMPUTER KEYS...
<br>
<br>                             TREVOR
<br>                      (quietly)
<br>               Eskander filed for stress leave.
<br>               They want me to finish out the

<br>               It's only 'til the end of the

<br>               Listen, I never thanked you
<br>               for letting me cry on your
<br>               shoulder.

<br>     Trevor flickers a conciliatory nod, now he averts his
<br>     eyes.

<br>                  Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
<br>                         (as Trevor shrugs)
<br>                  Ford told me he hasn't phoned
<br>                  his P.O. in four days.
<br>                         (weighs guilt;
<br>                          whispering)
<br>                  You know what they say. Be
<br>                  careful what you pray for. Don't
<br>                  get me wrong, Benny's made my life
<br>                  a living hell. I even moved back
<br>                  in with my mother because of him.
<br>                  I love my mother, but if I eat one
<br>                  more dinner off a TV tray or watch
<br>                  one more rerun of 'Wheel of
<br>                  Fortune,' I think I'll lose my
<br>                  fucking mind.
<br>
<br>     Now an EGG TIMER RINGS O.S. on Ellen's desk.      Back into

<br>                  Time's up. Everyone stop working.
<br>
<br>     Realizing now that all the CLACKING COMPUTER KEYS have

<br>     Trevor, tie loosened. Ellen, in nylon stocking feet,
<br>     leaning back against a couch. On the coffee table before
<br>     them are dirty dishes and half-full wine glasses.
<br>     Trevor's lost in a thin introspective smile.

<br>                  Sometimes. There's this passage
<br>                  in God's Lonely Man by Thomas
<br>                  Wolfe where he says, '... The
<br>                  whole conviction of my life rests
<br>                  upon the belief that loneliness is
<br>                  the central and inevitable fact of
<br>                  human existence.' I believe that.

<br>                  Terrazas. This was last year
<br>                  sometime. Kid was failing miserably
<br>                  ... But he was the best Salsa dancer
<br>                  in the whole school.

<br>                  Male teachers can't do things like

<br>                                ELLEN
<br>                  Yep, double standard... By the way,
<br>                  did you know Cesar Sanchez was

<br>                  Yep, he never should've been
<br>                  mainstreamed. His I.E.P. says he's

<br>     left hand.
<br>
<br>                                ELLEN
<br>                  Come on, Garfield -- on your feet.

<br>
<br>     Ellen spins the tuner on the STEREO to a LATIN STATION
<br>     and practically yanks Trevor to his feet.
<br>
<br>                                 ELLEN
<br>                  Let's go.   Don't play shy with me,
<br>                  homeboy.

<br>     Trevor grimaces, awkwardly relinquishes, as Ellen walks
<br>     him through it.

<br>
<br>     Trevor concentrates. Up to speed now. Technically he's
<br>     got it, he just needs to loosen up. Ellen suppresses a
<br>     gleeful snicker. Now, Trevor attempts to cut loose.
<br>     He spins Ellen once, into a tango step, one-two-three.
<br>     Now an awkward dip, causing her glass to spill wine down
<br>     the back of his shirt...

<br>                  Grab the baking soda outta the
<br>                  fridge.
<br>
<br>     In a flurry, Ellen rushes into the kitchen. Flips on the
<br>     kitchen light, jerks open the refrigerator and locates
<br>     the baking soda.

<br>     Trevor is bent over, scrubbing his shirt in the sink.
<br>     His bare back and shoulders are scattered with brutal

<br>
<br>     A tract house in the central San Fernando Valley.
<br>     Trevor's Rambler is parked at the curb. The house is dark
<br>     except for a porch light.
<br>
<br>     Trevor and Ellen are greeted by Ellen's golden retriever
<br>     Jack, who's chained to the front porch. JACK WHIMPERS,
<br>     ready to bark.
<br>
<br>                             ELLEN
<br>               Don't start barking, Jack.
<br>
<br>                             TREVOR
<br>                      (petting him)
<br>               Hey there, boy. You're a good
<br>               dog. Yes, you are.
<br>
<br>     Jack nuzzles up to Trevor, tail wagging furiously, no
<br>     barking. Now Trevor stands and faces Ellen...
<br>
<br>                             ELLEN
<br>               Sorry for reacting the way I did
<br>               back there.
<br>
<br>                             TREVOR
<br>               Don't apologize. That's how most
<br>               people react.
<br>
<br>                             ELLEN
<br>               Didn't scare me. It just
<br>               surprised me.
<br>
<br>                             ELLEN
<br>               ... Thanks for dinner.   I had a
<br>               good time.
<br>
<br>                             TREVOR
<br>               You're welcome.
<br>
<br>     Awkward silence. Trevor struggles with the urge to kiss
<br>     her good night. They look at each other timidly for a
<br>     moment. Now he moves to kiss her and she inadvertently
<br>     adjusts her stance. The result is a kiss that doesn't
<br>     quite hit her mouth. It's an awkward moment. Ellen
<br>     feels horrible for him, desperately picks up a strange
<br>     little plant by her feet.
<br>
<br>                             ELLEN
<br>               Here... you need a little life in
<br>               that place of yours.
<br>
<br>     Trevor takes it, smiles "thanks"...
<br>

<br>      sheets are twisted and damp. We TILT UP to see a digital

<br>      madly pedaling TOWARD us on a bike. He wears running
<br>      shoes, shorts and a Morehouse College sweat shirt and his
<br>      face is contorted from the effort. He wipes sweat from
<br>      his head, takes a gasping hit from his inhaler as CAMERA

<br>      back yard of his house, rapidly going nowhere.

<br>      His sleepless night continues. Planted at his desk.
<br>      Trevor corrects a stack of science papers, like a fervent
<br>      prayer. Sun peeks through the window above his desk.

<br>      It's sweltering.    A single fan stirs the air.

<br>      Amidst growing disorder, Trevor stands behind the front

<br>                  Rita, would you bring me a sugar
<br>                  cube from the shelf over there?
<br>
<br>     She does. Trevor now removes a small amber bottle
<br>     (with an eye-dropper top) from his briefcase. The
<br>     class starts to settle down now as Trevor pre-measures
<br>     water in a pipette and adds it to the petri dish.

<br>                  Forget it.

<br>     Cesar heaves the book across the room: Class erupts,
<br>     "Refer 'im," "Send 'im tuh Hyland." Trevor walks over

<br>     Cesar grudgingly watches as Trevor places a measured drop
<br>     of the liquid demeral into the petri dish and stirs the

<br>                  Demeral is a morphine sulphate...
<br>                  and is soluble in water.

<br>     Using the pipette, Trevor administers two drops of the
<br>     demeral and water solution to the sugar cube, which he

<br>     Snowball isn't moving. HOLD for an uncomfortably long
<br>     moment ON the class, clustered around Trevor's desk.
<br>
<br>     The class, for once, is completely silent. Beads of
<br>     perspiration form on Trevor's upper lip as he

<br>
<br>     A wall air conditioner...
<br>
<br>     blows on Stevie and Cesar's sweaty backs. Trevor enters,
<br>     shirt equally drenched in sweat. The dead silence is
<br>     like that of a courtroom. MR. GARCIA, late forties,
<br>     drawn, sits behind his desk...
<br>
<br>     MR. HYLAND, stands in the outer office behind a glass
<br>     partition, head lowered. Hyland flashes Trevor a
<br>     defeated smile as we...
<br>
<br>     Trevor coolly deciphers the situation.
<br>
<br>     Garcia reaches down, switches on a portable tape recorder.
<br>
<br>                                MR. GARCIA
<br>                  You don't mind if I tape record
<br>                  our conversation. Matter of
<br>                  record. You understand.
<br>                         (indicating
<br>                          Mr. Hyland)
<br>                  Of course, you know Mr. Hyland.
<br>
<br>     Trevor weighs the situation.    Nods.

<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  Am I being questioned?

<br>                                MR. GARCIA
<br>                         (beat)
<br>                  Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Littleton tell
<br>                  me you've accused them of stealing
<br>                  your watch. If that's the case, I
<br>                  need to address the accusation.

<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  ... For the record, I primarily
<br>                  suspect Mr. Sanchez. Although I
<br>                  wouldn't be surprised if Stevie
<br>                  was an accomplice.
<br>                         (glances over at
<br>                          Cesar and Stevie)
<br>                  Beginning of sixth period, Cesar
<br>                  admired the watch. I believe his
<br>                  exact words were, 'Can I have it?'
<br>                         (looks back to Garcia)
<br>                  Either way, I'd like my watch back.
<br>
<br>                                   MR. GARCIA
<br>                  Anything else?

<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  When I asked him to empty his
<br>                  pockets, Cesar refused.
<br>
<br>                                MR. GARCIA
<br>                  Is that true, Mr. Sanchez?
<br>
<br>                                CESAR
<br>                  No way. He never asked me nothin'
<br>                  like that! I don't go 'round
<br>                  taxing no teachers...
<br>
<br>                                 MR. GARCIA
<br>                  Okay.   Calm down.
<br>
<br>     With fervor now, Cesar turns his pockets inside out,
<br>     emptying the contents (house keys and two dollars in
<br>     change) onto Garcia's desk.
<br>
<br>                                CESAR
<br>                  ... I ain't got no watch, man.
<br>
<br>                                MR. GARCIA
<br>                  Mr. Littleton, may we see your
<br>                  pockets too?
<br>
<br>     Stevie empties his pockets now. Nothing but a twenty
<br>     dollar bill and an empty pack of Marlboros.
<br>
<br>     Trevor just stares at him.
<br>

<br>                  You're excused, gentlemen.   Take
<br>                  your things. Thank you.

<br>     The boys collect their belongings off Garcia's desk and
<br>     shoot looks at Trevor as they exit. Now Garcia turns
<br>     back to Trevor...
<br>
<br>                                MR. GARCIA
<br>                         (unflinching pragmatism)
<br>                  ... Let me try and explain
<br>                  something. I try and think of
<br>                  our students here at John Quincy
<br>                  Adams like they're my clients.
<br>                  I can't accuse anybody just on
<br>                  your hunches. I need more than
<br>                  that. I need facts.
<br>                         (looking at Hyland)
<br>                  I won't have another law suit like
<br>                  we did with that Blackwell case.
<br>                         (now to Trevor)
<br>                  Boy's mother spent $400 that she
<br>                  couldn't afford on new clothes for
<br>                  her son. Unfortunately we
<br>                  considered the clothing gang
<br>                  attire and sent the boy home.
<br>                  That cost the district a quarter
<br>                  of a million dollars.
<br>                         (beat)
<br>                  So I want you to be straight with
<br>                  me, Mr. Garfield. Did you
<br>                  physically see Cesar take your
<br>                  watch?
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  No, I didn't...
<br>
<br>                                MR. GARCIA
<br>                  Do you have any witnesses who saw
<br>                  him take it?

<br>                                MR. GARCIA
<br>                  Unless there's reasonable cause to
<br>                  show that Cesar, or Mr. Littleton
<br>                  took your watch then I can't
<br>                  authorize a locker search. I'm
<br>                  sorry. Any concerns regarding my
<br>                  decision, you can look up in the

<br>
<br>     At a right angle to Lankershim, down Magnolia Blvd., Rita
<br>     Nartinez sits alone on a bus stop bench.
<br>
<br>                                ELLEN (V.O.)
<br>                  Oh, you should go sometime,
<br>                  Trevor. I think you'd like it.
<br>                  Really. It's only an hour by air.
<br>                  Maybe five or six by car.
<br>                  Completely different attitude
<br>                  from L.A. Much more like a real
<br>                  city... like Chicago or New
<br>                  York...
<br>
<br>     As Ellen continues talking we see a lowered blue Nissan
<br>     mini-truck (with matching shell) pull up next to the bus
<br>     stop. A cholo from the utility shed hangs out the
<br>     passenger window and taunts Rita. Rita immediately
<br>     stands and walks back down Magnolia.
<br>
<br>     The mini-truck follows her in reverse. Rita halts and
<br>     begins ranting at the cholo, waving her arms all around.
<br>     Now she stomps away and the mini-truck drives away with a
<br>     lurch.

<br>
<br>     Trevor's conference period. He stands atop a ladder in
<br>     the front of the room, drilling holes in the wall for a
<br>     jerry-rigged camera mount. As he climbs down, Rita
<br>     enters. Paces back and forth, wringing a clenched spiral
<br>     notebook, English Comp. essay tucked inside...
<br>
<br>                               TREVOR
<br>                        (continues working)

<br>                 somethin' wit' my life.
<br>
<br>     A POLAROID PHOTO drops out of her notebook.     Trevor
<br>     reaches down and scoops it up.
<br>
<br>
<br>     INSERT - POLAROID PHOTO/DEAD GANG MEMBER IN CASKET

<br>                 ... You know this guy?

<br>     Rita takes the photo back.    She doesn't want to talk
<br>     about it.

<br>     Rita collapses into a desk.
<br>
<br>                                  TREVOR
<br>                  Who's Quinn?    What's she teach?

<br>     Trevor tentatively picks up Rita's essay (branded with a
<br>     big red "F") and begins reading it.
<br>
<br>                                RITA
<br>                  'Bitch say I don't talk right.

<br>     Trevor scrutinizes her with a glance.        Now back to Rita's
<br>     essay.

<br>                                  RITA
<br>                  She hates me.    She's racist
<br>                  against me.
<br>
<br>     Trevor sets the essay down on Rita's desk.        Regards her
<br>     with genuine candor...
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  Just cause you're a Latina doesn't

<br>                  else. You're too smart for that.
<br>                         (as Rita's rocked
<br>                          back)
<br>                  And every mistake in that essay is
<br>                  fixable, okay? So relax, it's not
<br>                  the end of the world.
<br>
<br>     Rita collects herself, wipes the streaks of mascara
<br>     running down her cheeks with her sleeve. Trevor studies
<br>     her for a moment.

<br>                  You don't need it.
<br>
<br>     She grabs a handful of tissues, dabs at her smeared
<br>     mascara. Now her hair falls forward, exposing the back
<br>     of her neck... and a tattoo that reads "Puppet" in
<br>     a scrawling signature. She tosses her hair back and it
<br>     disappears.

<br>                  I don't think so. I'd say we're

<br>     as Trevor approaches the couch, eyes focused on Rita's
<br>     soda.

<br>                         (preoccupied)
<br>                  Ask yourself this question. Is
<br>                  pride really that important?
<br>
<br>     Now he looks up and freezes.    Quickly turns away.
<br>
<br>     Rita, lying on the couch, completely naked.        Not sexual in
<br>     the least. More like a distorted offering.         Or a patient,
<br>     placidly waiting for her doctor.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                         (plainly)
<br>                  Put your clothes on, Rita.
<br>
<br>     An awkward moment. Chagrin becomes repressed sobs as
<br>     Rita picks up her pile of clothes off the floor and gets
<br>     dressed. This is one fucked-up little girl.
<br>

<br>                  No harm done... Don't cry now.
<br>
<br>     Fully dressed again, remotely staring, Rita holds back
<br>     tears. Trevor sits down on the couch next to her. Opens
<br>     textbook.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                  Why don't you go ahead and copy
<br>                  the first rule there for the verb

<br>                  You don't have to thank me, I'm
<br>                  your teacher.
<br>
<br>     Rita opens her notebook and begins to copy the rule. She
<br>     wipes at the tears with the sleeve of her baggy sweat
<br>     shirt. Trevor resists the urge to comfort her.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR

<br>     Trevor kneels at the foot of his bed. Fully dressed,
<br>     shirt and loosened tie. Glimpses up at the crucifix on

<br>     their arguing as Cesar watches first the "Animaniacs" and
<br>     switches channels to "The Deer Hunter," while his BABY
<br>     SISTER CRIES in her high chair.

<br>                                  CHILDRESS
<br>                  Get out!!
<br>
<br>     And now Snowball... as Barsek discovers him... Lifeless.
<br>     Impaled by a pair of scissors on the front counter.
<br>
<br>                                BARSEK
<br>                         (an incredulous,

<br>
<br>     OFF Trevor's stricken gaze...
<br>
<br>     Childress snaps. He grabs Barsek by the throat. The
<br>     crowd scatters, students tripping over each other to get
<br>     out of the bungalow.
<br>
<br>                                CHILDRESS
<br>                  Think it's funny?! Huh?!       Yuh
<br>                  little fuck!

<br>                  Nooo...
<br>
<br>     Trevor pries them apart. Barsek crumbles to the floor,
<br>     gulping for air and scurrying out of the bungalow on his
<br>     hands and knees.

<br>     Feature PACO (16) as they take quick hits off a blunt.
<br>
<br>     Now Cesar extinguishes the blunt with his fingertips and
<br>     hides it as Trevor wanders into their midst.

<br>                  talkin' about.
<br>
<br>     Trevor maintains his fervent demeanor. Now he notices
<br>     the ring on Cesar's right index finger.
<br>
<br>
<br>     INSERT - CESAR'S RING
<br>
<br>     emblazoned with a green marijuana leaf.

<br>     Cesar dramatically jerks back his finger.

<br>                  It's inappropriate attire...

<br>
<br>     Cesar starts to laugh.    A crowd begins to gather.
<br>
<br>                                CESAR
<br>                  What? Finished with what?   Don't

<br>
<br>     Ellen sits on Trevor's bed, fighting back tears.
<br>
<br>     Trevor enters with a glass of water and a pill.     Sits
<br>     down on the edge of the bed.
<br>
<br>                                TREVOR
<br>                         (offering pill)
<br>                  It's aspirin...
<br>
<br>                                ELLEN
<br>                         (refuses it)
<br>                  ... I can't talk to you right now,
<br>                  Trevor. Please. I'm so upset I
<br>                  can't even drive. I just need some
<br>                  time alone.
<br>
<br>     Trevor acquiesces. Steps over to his desk and sets the
<br>     glass of water down. A key protrudes from one of the desk
<br>     drawers. He leans over, removes the key and plays with it
<br>     for a moment.

<br>                  I know about what's not fair. I
<br>                  left part of my lung in a damn
<br>                  hospital because some gangbanger
<br>                  didn't like the grade I gave him.

<br>                         (eyes flicker)
<br>                  I'm so sorry, Ellen.

<br>     A thorough investigation now at the foot of Jack's
<br>     wall...
<br>
<br>     ... Trevor's flashlight fixes on a faint set of shoe prints
<br>     in the dirt.
<br>
<br>     Waffle-soled Doc Martens.    He follows their trail, down
<br>     the alley.
<br>
<br>     Hesitating at the wall again. He now focuses his
<br>     flashlight beam on a smattering of graffiti... and
<br>     discovers a fresh tag...
<br>
<br>     In black spray paint, the letters K.O.S. Trevor reaches
<br>     out and touches a coagulated trickle of paint. As he
<br>     inspects the faint residue on his fingertip...

<br>     About 2 a.m.    The street's empty.
<br>
<br>     Cesar's darkened apartment is tucked away in the
<br>     distance. Now a lone figure emerges and beats a path
<br>     through the projects... CLOSER now... it's Cesar. White
<br>     T-shirt, sagging gray dickies...
<br>
<br>     FOLLOWING HIM now... as he crosses the edge of a dirt
<br>     lot. FOCUSING ON his Doc Marten boots and their waffle-
<br>     soled print...

<br>     corridor. Lighting a blunt off his Zippo lighter...

<br>
<br>     Cesar spray paints a wall with a can of black enamel paint.
<br>     He takes another hit. Chokes down a shit-eating grin. And
<br>     admires his work... a goofy dog smoking a blunt.
<br>
<br>     ... below the dog he scrawls the word, "CARTOON." Above
<br>     it, "K.O.S. As he slips the spray can into his front
<br>     pocket, he senses a presence..

<br>                               CESAR
<br>                 ... 'At you, Stevie?
<br>
<br>     Profound silence. Grin dissolves. Riveted, Cesar takes
<br>     another slow hit off his blunt. Suddenly a coyote darts
<br>     past him.
<br>
<br>                               CESAR
<br>                        (startled)
<br>                 ... Hells, man. Stupit dog.
<br>
<br>     His sick smirk returns. But only momentarily. Now a
<br>     premonitory flicker registers on his face. He blinks as
<br>     a Masai arrow splits the darkness and pierces his left
<br>     pectoral muscle.
<br>
<br>     Exhaling a stunned breath, Cesar looks down at the arrow.
<br>     An incredulous, stupefied laugh escapes him as he pulls
<br>     the arrow out of his chest and studies it...
<br>
<br>     The normal length of the arrow's been shortened by half
<br>     and the tip has been fitted with a modified hypodermic
<br>     needle. (The needle extends from a rubber stopper which has
<br>     retracted into the hypodermic casing, causing the
<br>     solution in the hypo to jettison through the needle and
<br>     into Cesar).
<br>
<br>                               CESAR
<br>                 ... Mutha fuck.
<br>
<br>     Now back-pedaling, stumbling, dropping the arrow, he
<br>     turns and runs off.

<br>
<br>     Now blackness...

<br>      Ellen awakens with a start.
<br>
<br>      She glances about, momentarily disoriented.      Now she
<br>      remembers where she is and what happened.

<br>                                 ELLEN

<br>      desk. Bravely collects herself. Crosses over to the
<br>      desk and sits down.

<br>                   ... Where'd you put the aspirin?
<br>
<br>      Like an involuntary reflex she tugs on the center drawer
<br>      of the desk, but it's locked. Now she pulls on one of
<br>      the side drawers and it slides open. Ellen stops at what
<br>      she sees...
<br>
<br>      ... a treasure-trove of homemade shivs, Bic lighters,
<br>      Walkmen, pagers... and Benny Chacon's black rosary beads.
<br>
<br>      BACK TO Ellen and her curious, sobered look.      Now she slowly
<br>      shuts the drawer.

<br>      Cesar's beaten gaze remains riveted to his book. Now he
<br>      slides a look at the "R-U-DUN" tatt on his right index
<br>      finger. The severed finger has been sewn back on,
<br>      supported by a finger brace.

<br>
<br>      Trevor and Rita at a table near the back of the library.
<br>      Trevor gazes blankly at Rita's essay. Rita revises one
<br>      of the pages.
<br>
<br>      INTERCUT Dave Childress at the front counter as the
<br>      librarian (late fifties) photocopies a page from a
<br>      history book for him. Childress scrutinizes Trevor and
<br>      Rita as he waits.
<br>
<br>      Satisfied now, Rita slides the page to Trevor...

<br>
<br>      The message read:    TEACHER FUCKS NIGGERS
<br>
<br>      Class is dumbstruck. Ellen's riveted. Now she turns.
<br>      Without losing her temper, she scours the class with
<br>      a narrow gaze.
<br>
<br>      Class starts to buzz.    Now a clicking frenzy to retrieve
<br>      the same message.
<br>
<br>      The anonymous message pops up on computer screens all
<br>      around the classroom.
<br>
<br>      Ellen's POV of students (and Stevie). Deciphering
<br>      reactions. LINGERING ON Stevie's poker face.

<br>                   Whoever sent that message isn't
<br>                   as anonymous as they think.
<br>
<br>      Ellen turns to her console, clicks the REPLY button.    A
<br>      new mail message window opens up. It's addressed to
<br>      the anonymous sender, STUDENT #00. Ellen types in:
<br>
<br>                                 GO TO THE OFFICE
<br>
<br>      All the while anticipation builds on Stevie's face.    He
<br>      glances around, starting to get nervous.
<br>
<br>      Ellen now clicks the SEND button...
<br>
<br>      Stevie's COMPUTER BEEPS...    COMPUTER VOICE:   "You've got
<br>      mail..."
<br>
<br>      ... A window opens in the middle of Stevie's monitor
<br>      revealing Ellen's return message.
<br>
<br>      Class erupts and Stevie springs out of his seat...
<br>
<br>                                 STEVIE
<br>                   'Dat's bullshit, man!
<br>
<br>      He rushes up to the front of the class.
<br>
<br>                                 STEVIE
<br>                   You best step off, Ms. H. Cuz
<br>                   you can't prove nuthin'. And I
<br>                   know you can't afford to lose
<br>                   'dis minimum wage job 'a yers.
<br>
<br>                                  ELLEN
<br>                           (beat and)
<br>                   You're right, Stevie. I can't
<br>                   afford to live in a big house
<br>                   south of the boulevard. Like
<br>                   you do.
<br>
<br>      Class erupts again, coming down on Stevie and his wanna-be
<br>      poor boy from the streets image. They're laughing at him
<br>      now, not with him. In a rage, Stevie kicks open the
<br>      hallway door and exits the classroom.

<br>      Teacher #1, the insipid woman, checks her mail slot.    It's
<br>      her conference period.
<br>
<br>                                 TEACHER #1
<br>                          (appalled)
<br>                   You're not supposed to leave

<br>                   Sue me.
<br>
<br>      Teacher #1 exits in a flurry. Ellen now glances to her
<br>      right. Seated there in rigid silence is BENNY CHACON'S
<br>      MOTHER (51).
<br>

<br>                   She been saying some pretty
<br>                   crazy things.
<br>
<br>      Mrs. Chacon begins speaking Spanish in plaintive spurts.
<br>      Ellen can't decipher what she is saying...
<br>
<br>                                 ELLEN
<br>                          (to Mrs. Chacon)

<br>                   Mrs. Chacon... you have to slow down.
<br>                          (back to Iris)
<br>                   What's she saying?

<br>                   You heard 'bout that body they foun'

<br>
<br>118   INT. ASSISTANT CORONER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION            118
<br>
<br>      Ellen and Mrs. Chacon sit stiffly in front of the
<br>      ASSISTANT CORONER (mid-forties). Desk cluttered. Half-
<br>      eaten sandwich in front of him. He nurses a Styrofoam
<br>      cup of coffee as he flips through a John Doe folder.
<br>
<br>                              ASST. CORONER
<br>                You say he's been missing
<br>                approximately four weeks?
<br>
<br>                              ELLEN
<br>                ... Four, almost five weeks.
<br>
<br>                              ASST. CORONER
<br>                That's a long time. Lots a
<br>                things happen to a body after
<br>                four or five weeks. Makes it
<br>                difficult to I.D.
<br>
<br>      A faint, incongruous smile.
<br>
<br>                              ELLEN
<br>                       (indicating John Doe)
<br>                So he just sits here?
<br>
<br>                              ASST. CORONER
<br>                We keep 'um up to thirty days.
<br>                Lady, we get 80, sometimes 90 Does
<br>                a month. Floaters, gangbangers,
<br>                illegals, junkies. Most of 'um
<br>                cheap homicides. Nobody's even
<br>                lookin' for 'em.
<br>                       (indicating folder)
<br>                This guy here, has a dent in his
<br>                head. Could be post-mortem
<br>                trauma. Probably hit a retaining
<br>                wall on his way down river after
<br>                that rain we had. Who knows.
<br>                       (beat)
<br>                Yuh ask me, this kid was dead
<br>                before he got his head caved in.
<br>                Overdose by morphine. That's what
<br>                it looks like t'me.
<br>
<br>      Ellen weighs it. Assistant Coroner now refers to some
<br>      sort of questionnaire.
<br>
<br>                              ASST. CORONER
<br>                On the phone you said the mother
<br>                mentioned some identifying marks.
<br>
<br>      Ellen refocuses a far-off, introspective gaze.

<br>                   She said he has some pockmarks on
<br>                   his chest; from a bad case of
<br>                   chicken pox. And there's a bar-
<br>                   code tattoo on his neck.

<br>      down his coffee...

<br>119   INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - EVENING                                     119
<br>
<br>      The acrid fecal smell causes Ellen to flinch. Averting
<br>      her eyes, she holds onto Mrs. Chacon's arm as they stand
<br>      next to the autopsy table. A plastic diaphanous sheet
<br>      covers the body.
<br>
<br>      Now the Assistant Coroner raises the sheet...
<br>
<br>      Mrs. Chacon's traumatic gaze confirms her worst fears.
<br>      She raises a hand to her mouth. Now the tears come...
<br>
<br>                                 MRS. CHACON

<br>      Trevor sleeps. HOLD for a portentous moment. Now the
<br>      stillness is broken by a CLATTER at the front door.

<br>                   What?

<br>      places them in a drawer in the credenza.

<br>                   about that 'fore we shed any tears.
<br>
<br>      Ellen just looks at him.

<br>                                 TREVOR

<br>                                 ELLEN
<br>                   That's a horrible thing to say.
<br>
<br>      Trevor accepts that it is.

<br>                   Do you believe for every troubled
<br>                   kid like Benny there's one or two
<br>                   others just waiting to take his
<br>                   place? Like Cesar... or his
<br>                   friend Stevie.
<br>
<br>      An awkward moment of silence...

<br>                   Sometimes a person just runs out
<br>                   of bad choices. Then he's gotta
<br>                   pay a price. What happened to
<br>                   Cesar was inevitable.
<br>
<br>      Ellen flickers a terrified smile.

<br>      from outside in the quad.
<br>
<br>      At the same time, Steve follows him into the rest room.
<br>      They're all alone.

<br>      Bracing himself with a fixed, straight-ahead look.

<br>
<br>      Trevor's head begins to swim. His life's falling apart.
<br>      Like a trapped animal, he back-pedals a step to escape...
<br>      but then suddenly snaps.
<br>
<br>      He explodes into Stevie, crushing him against the bath-
<br>      room wall.
<br>
<br>      Trevor impales Stevie with a look that says it all.
<br>
<br>      Stevie immediately shrinks. Trevor now blinks. Cooling
<br>      himself down. Slowing his breathing. Stevie slips out
<br>      from under his hold and bolts for the exit.

<br>      Rita... Makeup subdued, wearing a cotton button-down blouse.
<br>      She watches the Quebradita from behind a tree. A desire

<br>      news. Eyes penetrating. Now galvanized. On a rampage,
<br>      he shoves his way through the crowd.
<br>
<br>      Victor Sifuentes... on the opposite side of the patio,
<br>      snapping a look, spotting Cesar moving in for the kill.
<br>      With a start, Victor barks something into his walkie-
<br>      talkie and squeezes his way into the Quebradita crowd...
<br>
<br>      Cesar shoves Rita to the ground.

<br>      On stage the discipline committee, including Trevor,
<br>      Childress, Hyland and Quinn sit at the dais. Garcia
<br>      stands at the podium, waiting for silence. MRS. FORD,
<br>      the assistant principal, a full-figured black woman in
<br>      her mid-fifties, stands alongside him, gesturing for
<br>      the crowd to settle down.

<br>                          (too noisy)
<br>                   The death of Benito Chacon is not
<br>                   gang-related.

<br>                   That's something you heard on
<br>                   the news. It's wrong. It's

<br>                   aren't even sure if it's a case of
<br>                   murder. The reason we're having
<br>                   this meeting tonight is to quash
<br>                   all the rumors floating around out
<br>                   there. Okay. Here's what we do
<br>                   know. Benny Chacon ultimately died
<br>                   from a drug overdose, technically
<br>                   it was morphine.
<br>                           (volume rising again)

<br>
<br>      Up at the dais, Trevor notices her.

<br>                   It's not the gangbangers y'gotta

<br>                   know he did it. He fucked up
<br>                   Cesar and he killed Benny.

<br>                   Yer dead, G! Yer a dead man!
<br>
<br>      With that Stevie shoves Victor aside and bolts for the

<br>      All traces of a smile fade from Dave's face.      Trevor

<br>      Awkward glint of admiration in Childress's eye.     Leans
<br>      forward, hangs a hand on Trevor's shoulder.

<br>      Rita, back to her chola look, heavy makeup, black (right)
<br>      eye where Cesar punched her, watches her two younger
<br>      brothers as they fight over a toy truck. Her
<br>      three-year-old baby sister, Maricella (too big to be

<br>      Garcia holds up a handful of phone messages.

<br>                   Cesar's mother told me how you
<br>                   tried to help him. You're evidently
<br>                   a good teacher. You should be
<br>                   commended on your efforts. However...
<br>                          (pause)
<br>                   I'm going to have to let you go.

<br>                   As much as I'd like to have you
<br>                   stay until the end of the year, I
<br>                   can't overlook the seriousness of
<br>                   certain accusations.
<br>
<br>      Mr. Garcia waits for a response but none is forthcoming.
<br>
<br>                                 MR. GARCIA
<br>                          (for example)
<br>                   ... Is it true you had meetings with
<br>                   a female student at your house?
<br>
<br>                                 TREVOR
<br>                   I was trying to help her.
<br>
<br>                                  MR. GARCIA
<br>                   The implications are still there,
<br>                   Mr. Garfield. I can't afford to
<br>                   open the door for another lawsuit.
<br>                   Sure you can appreciate my position.
<br>                          (pause)
<br>                   You can stay until Friday. I hope
<br>                   that will be sufficient.

<br>                   This guy's been through a lot,
<br>                   Ellen. The system failed him.
<br>                   I don't think any of us can really

<br>      Cherokee.

<br>      She deciphers Trevor with mixed emotions.        Trevor adjusts

<br>                  my finger... Say it.
<br>
<br>      Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.
<br>
<br>                                   TREVOR
<br>                  Yeah.   I did.

<br>                  No.   This nigga's mine.
<br>
<br>      Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes
<br>      ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.
<br>
<br>      Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a
<br>      fist to reveal six bullets.
<br>
<br>                                CESAR

<br>      ANOTHER ANGLE
<br>
<br>      In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room
<br>      table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the
<br>      other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets
<br>      into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor
<br>      as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.
<br>
<br>                                 CESAR
<br>                   You gon' do yourself, mayate.
<br>                   Put it to your head and pull the
<br>                   trigger.
<br>
<br>      Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to
<br>      his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.
<br>      He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.
<br>      A crazed, watery glint in his eye.
<br>
<br>                                 TREVOR

<br>      All three tag-bangers are taken aback.

<br>                   homeboy. Yeah, my body... but
<br>                   what I am, who I was? That's

<br>      Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun
<br>      on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.
<br>
<br>                                 PACO
