<b>               EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT TO DAWN
</b>
               Thundering north through the glass canyons of the Loop, the 
               elevated train SCREECHES through the city awakening. As it 
               races north across the river past ancient factories giving 
               way to high rise splendor, lights glistening against the 
               dawn, we see the complex business of bringing a city to life 
               in the morning.

               On the Near North Side an assortment of revelers are winding 
               up their night on the town.

               The pressmen loiter outside the Tribune loading docks, and 
               fishing boats are outbound through the Chicago River locks.

               A streetsweeping crew moves through the Fulton Market, 
               Chicago's central meat and produce distribution center.

               At the Merchandise Mart platform the elevated train picks up 
               two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</b>
               The el train RUMBLES north past the aging tenements of Uptown 
               into the Belmont Avenue Station.

               And down below, a garbage truck is slowly working its way up 
               the alley. A garbage man in city overalls WHISTLES to the 
               driver and the truck stops. He rolls a can to the grinding 
               jaw as the driver sits, tense and alert, scanning the street.

               There's something odd about this driver. And the garbage man 
               too, for that matter.

<b>               EXT. EL PLATFORM - DAY
</b>
               SPIDER, a nervous looking black man, steps out onto the 
               platform. As the train pulls away we see him reach into his 
               shirt pocket and CLICKS his ball point pen a couple of times. 
               He WHISPERS into it. It is a concealed radio transmitter.

<b>                                     SPIDER
</b>                         Say, hey, Cub fans, I hope to hell 
                         y'all down there cause we got a big 
                         game today.

               He heads for the stairs and the street below.

<b>               INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY
</b>
               The truck cab is equipped with a police radio. The driver, 
               RICH DONATO, adjusts the volume. Over the SPEAKER, HEAVY 
               WITH STATIC, we can hear the SOUND of the RECEDING EL TRAIN.

               Donato motions for the garbage man.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</b>
               EDDIE CUSACK jumps up on the truck's running board and sticks 
               his head in. On the seat beside Donato is a sledgehammer and 
               a sawed off automatic rifle. The two men stare at each other 
               as they concentrate on the CRACKLING RADIO.

<b>               EXT. EL STATION - DAY
</b>
               DOC is at the wheel of a late model Cadillac. Spider gets in 
               and they pull slowly away from the curb.

<b>               EXT. EL STATION - DAY
</b>
               At the corner in a beat up Pontiac are officers MUSIC and 
               BRENNAN. The two rough looking detectives follow Doc's car 
               through half closed eyes.

               They also HEAR Spider's TRANSMITTER. The quality of the 
               reception improves as Spider and his antennae clear the steel 
               support structure of the el platform.

                         me.

               Doc and Spider talk in a nervous false bravado.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               Eddie nods to Donato who grabs a walkie-talkie from the seat.

<b>               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
               Two cops are against the wall separating the cemetery from 
               the El. CRAGIE, a weathered twenty-five year veteran; and 
               NICK KOSALAS, the new kid on the team. Cragie sits on a crate 
               with a styrofoam cup of coffee.

               Kosalas is trying to maneuver his cup lid off, and still 
               hold on to his walkie-talkie.

<b>                                     DONATO (V.O.)

                         Ready sir. Left Field in position.

               Cragie pulls a pint of whiskey from his pocket and sweetens 
               his coffee with a healthy shot. He notices Kosalas, who has 
               set down the thermos and is nervously moving from leg to 
               leg.

               Cragie grins and raises his cup to drink. His hand shakes 
               and he has to steady it with the other.

               The RADIO CRACKLES.

               A spotter, KOBAS, covers the scene from an abandoned building

</b>
               Eddie wrestles another garbage can into the truck's hopper 
               as Doc's car cruises slowly past.

               Eddie and Spider LOCK EYES for a split second.

               The car moves on and stops at the far end of the alley. The 
               lights switch off. After a moment, Spider and Doc leave the 
               car and check out the scene. Doc carries a satchel.

                         know? Ain't no big thing.

               The two men slip into the back gate of an old tenement. They 
               pass through a gangway to the front of the building, and 
               climb the front stairs.

               Though we can no longer see them, we HEAR a DOOR OPENING, a 
               GREETING in Spanish, and FEET FOUNDING up the steps.

               The garbage truck GRINDS forward and halts again. Eddie comes 
               up to the cab. He is wearing a gun under his overalls. He 
               and Donato listen on the RADIO to the CONVERSATION coming 
               from inside the building.

<b>               INT. COMACHO FRONT STAIRS - DAY
</b>
               A muscular Latino, POMPAS COMACHO, leads Spider and Doc down 
               the paint-peeling corridor. The SOUND of BABIES CRYING and 
               FAMILIES WAKING gives a sense of teeming humanity behind 
               every door.

               The Latino knocks at a door heavily fortified with burglar 
               bars. The door opens. The bars are unlocked.

               Pompas leaves the two men and heads down the stairs toward 
               the front door.

               Doc and Spider enter. They're patted down.

               A sleepy eyed Latino woman comes to stand in the bedroom 
               doorway. VICTOR COMACHO barks at her in Spanish, and she 
               disappears into the bedroom.

               Comachos are heavily armed. There is plenty of tension all 
               around, but Doc seems a little more nervous than the rest.

               This is an enormous buy. Doc has placed a bowling satchel 
               full of bundled $20's, $50's, and $100's on the table. Victor 
               is counting it rapidly.

               Doc slices into one of the bags and with the tip of his knife

               and enter a vacant apartment.

               A door opens in the corridor, and a naked toddler steps out. 
               A Latino teenager comes out to retrieve the child. He sees

               Vito turns on a radio to a Latino station to cover the SOUND 
               of their preparations. They remove the whole window from its

               Three feet away is the window of the adjacent building and 
               silhouetted against the shade we can SEE the drug deal.

               The struggle on the landing is brief. Efren's size is no

               Eddie starts to leave again. Kates picks up the phone, and 
               puts a hand over the mouthpiece.

               Eddie exits.

<b>               INT. HEADQUARTERS OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               Kosalas, without an attorney, is being interviewed by Partida. 
               A court stenographer is silently typing.

<b>                                     PARTIDA

<b>               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY
</b>
               Eddie and Kosalas are parked on an airport access road, 
               watching private planes land and take off. Eddie's car, a 
               five-year old Chevy, is wreckage. The quarter panels are 
               rusted, the radio antenna is a coathanger, and when Kosalas 
               pushes a tape into the cassette player, the windshield wipers 
               start moving.

               Kosalas pops the cassette out, the windshield wipers stop; 
               he throws the cassette into the glove compartment. But now 
               he can't get the door to stay closed.

<b>                                     EDDIE
</b>                         I'm going to have to fix that.

               Eddie has to shout to be heard over the sound of an airplane 
               passing directly overhead.

               Eddie glances at Kosalas who looks uncomfortable.

<b>                                     EDDIE
</b>                         You know, it's kind of interesting. 
                         That 16 year old in the hallway with 
                         the gun? Partida told me he doesn't 
                         have a record. The kid's never been 
                         arrested.

<b>                                     KOSALAS
</b>                         Yeah, well, you know, if you read 
                         the papers, cops only shoot honor 
                         students. Sole support of the family 
                         and all that.

<b>               EXT. AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
               The airport bristles with corporate jets departing and 
               arriving.

<b>                                     TOWER (V.O.)

                         landing -- wind south 20, altimeter 
                         two-niner-niner-two...

               And now comes a mystery jet, wearing no company colors, 
               banking in over Lake Point Tower and WHISTLING low over the 
               Planetarium to a touchdown.

               The white Learjet taxis to a halt at the far end of the field 
               as an undistinguished Buick rolls down the ramp to meet it.

               Eddie and Kosalas stand by their car, parked across the runway 
               from the Learjet.

               The jet's engines shut down, the door opens, and a grim but 
               handsome man emerges. LUIS COMACHO, a cruel and uncompromising 
               survivor, has arrived. With him is an incredibly beautiful 
               exotic woman.

               He is met by Pompas and Efren Comacho, the two lookouts who 
               survived the raid. And Victor Comacho, who was wounded in 
               the raid, is here with his shoulder bandaged.

<b>               EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY
</b>
               From where Eddie and Kosalas are standing it is impossible 
               to hear the conversation at the Learjet, but it is clear 
               that Luis Comacho is upset. They see Luis slap Pompas and 
               Efren. Then he grabs Victor by both arms, ignoring his wound, 
               and screams at him.

<b>                                     KOSALAS
</b>                         Nice fellow this Luis Comacho. Donato 
                         says they call him the Angel-of-Death.

               Victor grimaces, in great pain, and his knees buckle.

</b>
               In the dining room DIANA LUNA, a pretty 19 year old, helps 
               her 80 year old grandmother THERESA decorate a "HAPPY 
               BIRTHDAY" banner, some red and green crepe paper.

               Diana and her grandmother grin at each other. They are done. 
               Theresa stands back to admire their work.

               Diana rushes into the kitchen and comes right out with a 
               birthday cake, and sets it on the table next to some presents.

<b>                                     THERESA

               Diana goes to the stairs where her mother sits with her hands 
               over her eyes.

</b>                         O.K., open 'em.

               MOLLY LUNA opens her eyes. Theresa and Diana beam. Diana 
               kisses her mother who almost cries.

                         Happy birthday, Molly.

               Diana hands Molly a card from the table. Molly starts to 
               open it.

               Tony Luna burst in from another room.

               Molly heads for the stairs, leaving behind the half opened 
               card.

               Molly goes upstairs. Diana is pissed.

               Tony goes to the phone, dials, gets a busy signal, and slams 
               it down.

               Theresa sits down watching sadly.

               Diana goes to stand in front of her father.

               Tony sorts through the closet looking for a jacket.

               Gamiani comes in puffing with a clumsily wrapped present 
               under his arm.

               He slaps her. She slaps him back, turns, grabs her purse, 
               and runs out.

               Tony watches her go and turns to Gamiani.

               Molly comes down with the bag. Tony takes it from her and 
               starts out the door. Suddenly he turns back, snatches 
               Gamiani's present from his hands, and thrust it at his wife.

               Eddie comes back into the living room, hands a beer and a 
               soda to Odell, and flops back on the sofa with his own beer.

               Pirelli reaches for his drink and Odell hands him the soda. 
               Pirelli grabs the beer before Odell can drink and switches.

               Pirelli and Odell turn to Eddie who tries to look innocent -- 
               but fails. Eddie purposefully studies the answering machine 
               on the coffee table in front of him.

               The machine in question looks like a miniature tank. This is 
               the "Prowler," a robot anti-terrorist vehicle that is being 
               maneuvered around various obstacles in a demonstration for 
               the city's law enforcement agencies.

               The "Prowler" is amazingly agile. And its BULLHORN VOICE 
               breaks everybody up.

               The machine's three video eyes, searching the crowd 
               independently, give it the appearance of an extra-industrial 
               bug. One camera is mounted on a telescoping mast which extends 
               to give it the perspective of a giraffe. The thing seems 
               almost alive.

               Commander Kates is here, leading a contingent of departmental 
               brass. With them are several dozen officers and a gaggle of 
               city councilmen.

               The Prowler is being put through its paces by the FACTORY 
               ENGINEER. He controls the machine with a pistol-grip device 
               that looks like a small TV camera.

                         duplicated by the 'Prowler.'

               He turns his hand to the right and the Prowler, 50 yards 
               away, sweeps its turret to the right, aiming the twin 30 
               calibre machineguns at the politicians. They move aside.

                         operate the unit with a minimum of

               Standing with Chief Kates, Eddie watches the demonstration

               Kates is about to say something when the demonstrator 
               interrupts.

                         show how our various target 
                         acquisition systems function.

               Kates points to Eddie, and smiles.

               Instantly the turret sweeps the horizon and locks on Eddie 
               as he walks across the astro turf.

               CLOSE-UP of the Prowler's hand controller.

               The MONITOR SCREEN shows the crosshairs on the back of Eddie's

               Eddie keeps walking, seemingly oblivious to the Prowler. 
               Suddenly he whirls and ducks behind a wall out of the 
               Prowler's sight.

               He pops up with his gun pointed at the Prowler's controller.

               The controller, scared shitless, drops the hand control.

               Eddie smiles at Kates, and exits.

               Luis, hatred oozing from his eyes. And Eddie, without slowing,

               Eddie freezes, makes a slow turn, and meets Luis' eyes.

               Suddenly Eddie moves, faster than anyone else can react to, 
               and he has Luis pinned to the wall, choking him.

               Gamiani shrugs, his pal Tito seems embarrassed, but they 
               don't move.

               The CHILDREN SCREAM, and LULU, the half-ton baboon flies 
               into frame, swinging down from the artificial branches of an 
               iron tree in the three story central cage. The children clutch 
               at Diana in delightful terror. The gorilla, inches away, 
               kisses the thick glass that separates them.

               Lulu swings to the upper branches and sits, arms crossed, 
               staring eyeball-to-eyeball at her human counterpart, Gamiani. 
               Tito eats popcorn.

               Eddie and Kosalas walk behind a mother and child, each holding 
               a balloon.

               Diana is on the front steps of the library saying good-bye 
               to two of the children from the zoo. She hands them over to 
               their mothers, and goes up the steps into the building.

               Gamiani and Tito pull over and park down the street.

               Eddie comes around the corner, and follows her in.

               The sign on the door tells us this is the city's Special 
               Education Program office. Diana enters the office and confers 
               briefly with another staff member.

               Through the open door of the Special Education Program office, 
               Eddie observes Diana chatting with her co-workers.

               Eddie follows as Diana walks through the great hall past 
               long tables and out the other door.

               Diana comes down the steps, wading through the swarm of 
               homebound commuters, and catches a cab.

               And head and shoulders above the crowd, scanning the tops of 
               heads, is Lou Gamiani.

               Tito comes around the corner in his car, and pulls up to the 
               curb. Gamiani jumps in, and they take off after Diana's cab.

               Eddie and Kosalas follow in Eddie's car.

</b>
               By the time Diana exits it is dark. She is with a friend, 
               and both are in some kind of Halloween costume. They catch a 
               cab.

<b>               EXT. PARTY STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               The taxi stops in front of an ancient brick loft building. 
               Diana and her friend get out and hit the buzzer at an unmarked 
               door. The door opens and they disappears inside.

               Gamiani's car cruises past. It pulls up at the corner and 
               it's lights switch off.

               Eddie's car pulls up. Eddie hops out. Kosalas slides behind 
               the wheel.

               Eddie leans down to the open drivers window.

               Eddie goes to the back of the car, and Kosalas follows him 
               in the rearview mirror, losing sight when Eddie pops open 
               the trunk.

               Kosalas watches the party goers enter the building.

               There is a tapping at the window.

               Eddie has donned a baseball uniform, matching cap, and now 
               carries a baseball bat with a pair of cleats hanging from 
               it.

               Eddie tosses the keys back to Kosalas, and heads to the 
               building. Kosalas calls to him.

               In the darkened stairway Eddie joins a group of outrageously 
               dressed characters. The door at the top of the stairs bursts 
               open on a punk-funk art student Halloween party.

<b>               INT. PARTY - NIGHT

               A hundred people are jammed into the studio. It feels like 
               the Star Wars Saloon. The LIVE MUSICIANS match the look of 
               the party. The costumes are outrageous. Everyone is dancing.

               Eddie looks the place over. He spots Diana.

               Eddie walks over to her, grabbing a drink along the way. He 
               sidles up to Diana.

               She is angry now, and walks away from him.

               Eddie watches her go, and is about to follow. He sets his 
               drink down, and turns to find a girl, luscious as hell, 
               dressed like a Frederick's wet dream, making eyes at him. 
               She takes his bat, and gives it a long, lascivious lick.

               get to Diana who is tensely by herself.

               She walks away angrily. Eddie watches her leave, and then 
               steps over a few of the wasted witches to get to the phone 
               on the drug laden coffee table. He dials.

                         him in.

               The dope-smoking party-goers stare at this cop in shock. One 
               of the ladies tries to casually cover the cocaine with a 
               magazine. Eddie hangs up the phone, and pushes past them to

               toward the immense old warehouse along the river's edge. The 
               city seems to have abandoned this remote industrial area; 
               giant grain elevators, rusting freighters and vast scrapyards

               On the floor; a woman's legs, a housecoat, slippers. A 
               silhouette of a Comacho in the hallway RAKING one of Tony's 
               guards.

               A family photo on the mantle which includes Diana and her 
               father is BLASTED to bits.

               One of Tony's men tries to escape through the back of the 
               house. He is pursued by a Comacho who guns him down.

<b>               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY
</b>
               Luis Comacho sits in a car in the next block surveying the 
               scene. The cousins are walking briskly out. They jump in a 
               car and drive off.

               The street is QUIET again. Next door, a neighbor, wearing 
               only his underpants and carrying an old pistol, stands 
               trembling in disbelief.

<b>               EXT. LAKE - DAY
</b>
               Pines reflect in the dappled lake as Tony Luna rows slowly 
               for shore. He ties up at the dock. He's taking his tackle 
               out of the boat when one of his boys comes running down to 
               the dock.

               We cannot hear the conversation but we can see Tony drop the 
               tackle box and we can hear his SCREAM echo across the water.

<b>               EXT. EDDIE'S STREET - DAY
</b>
               Eddie runs down the rear stairs to Kosalas' unmarked car. He 
               opens the driver's door, pushes Kosalas across the seat, and 
               gets behind the wheel. He PEELS OUT.

                         mid-to-late forties. The other a 
                         grandmother.

               With the SIREN full out, LEANING ON the HORN, he simply puts 
               his foot on the floor and sends the car into a four wheel 
               drift that slides into a neat U-turn.

               Eddie leaves the car running, and burst through the main

               Eddie races through the corridors and reading rooms searching,

               Three Comachos; Pompas, Efren, and ANGEL, search for Diana.

<b>               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
               Lou Gamiani emerges from the building with Diana. She is 
               terrified.

               He checks out the scene, then descends the crowded steps and 
               crosses the street, keeping a sharp lookout.

<b>               EXT. FLOWER SHOP - DAY
</b>
               Luis and Victor Comacho loiter by the outdoor flower stand 
               next to the library. They watch the activity on the library 
               steps.

<b>               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
               Distracted for an instant by a cluster of conventioneers, 
               Lou fails to notice the two Comachos who have fallen in step 
               behind them. He goes down with a gasp, almost silently, a 
               knife sticking from his back. A Comacho grabs Diana's arm. 
               She jabs him in the eyes, and runs.

               Diana disappears into the crowd.

               Hysterical citizens scatter in all directions. A woman stands 
               in horror unable to keep from looking at Gamiani's body lying 
               on the sidewalk. She SCREAMS.

               Eddie and Kosalas come crashing out of the entrance of the 
               museum.

               The girl isn't here.

               Eddie spots a commotion at the end of the block, under the 
               el station.

               He dashes down the steps and across the street with traffic 
               screeching to a halt.

               Kosalas flags down a blue and white, and barks for backup, 
               then tears out after Eddie.

<b>               EXT. WABASH AVENUE - DAY
</b>
               In the shadow of the el tracks, Diana runs for her life, 
               racing north on Wabash through crowds of shoppers with the 
               Comachos moving relentlessly a half block behind.

               Opposite Marshall Field's, she abruptly cuts across traffic 
               and runs into an alley between the giant men's and women's 
               stores.

               With terror in her eyes, Diana runs, searching frantically 
               for a guard, a policeman, somebody with a gun. But the 
               Comachos are closing in on her.

               She dives through a revolving door into the building.

<b>               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
</b>
               Diana runs past the perfume displays, notions, and lingerie, 
               and out the Randolph Street exit.

<b>               EXT. RANDOLPH STREET - DAY
</b>
               Two Camachos, who stayed on the street, spot her as she 
               leaves.

               Racing through the alley, Eddie spots them running in the 
               next block.

<b>               EXT. LAKE STREET - DAY
</b>
               Running east on Lake Street, she glances over her shoulder. 
               She doesn't see them. She ducks into the alley. But the 
               Comachos round the corner just in time to catch a glimpse of 
               her.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</b>
               This alley leads to the lower level of Michigan Avenue. She 
               turns back to find the exit blocked by the Comachos. She 
               flees downward.

<b>               INT. LOWER MICHIGAN - DAY
</b>
               The green flourescents of the "Emerald City" give a deathly 
               cast to the underground street as Diana rounds the corner, 
               and collapses against the wall. Her heart pounding like a 
               frightened deer, she has run as far as she can.

               Pompas Comacho and two of his colleagues come racing around 
               the corner. They spot her crouched against the wall.

               She starts to SCREAM but Angel grabs her by the collar and 
               pulls her up to his face and she stops, wide-eyed with terror 
               as he touches her throat with his knife.

                         fun. You gonna take us to your father.

               We hear a loud metallic CLICK. We see the barrel of a huge 
               revolver. They wheel to see Eddie crouched, gun drawn, in 
               the alley entrance.

<b>                                     EDDIE

                         pain in the ass.

               The boys put their hands up, but Eddie doesn't see the third, 
               SAMO, coming up behind him.

               Angel grabs Diana by the hair, shielding himself, and starts 
               backing up the stairs that lead to the street.

<b>                                     EDDIE
</b>                         Let her go, pooch.

               Samo jumps Eddie, and the gun goes flying. It hits the 
               pavement and bounces off the high curb into the street.

               In a staggering blur Eddie takes out the Comachos, kicking 
               the last one end over end. But Angel and the girl have 
               disappeared to the street above.

               Eddie retrieves his gun and runs up the steps.

<b>               EXT. STATE LAKE EL STATION - DAY
</b>
               With a knife at her side, Angel Comacho leads Diana up the 
               steps of the old el station. They pass through the turnstyle 
               out onto the platform just as the train pulls to in. Angel 
               forces her onto the train.

               Eddie comes pounding up the steps and onto the platform just 
               in time to stop the closing train door with his foot.

<b>               INT. EL TRAIN - DAY
</b>
               Eddie wedges his way aboard and the train pulls out. The 
               passengers looks at him like he's crazy.

               Eddie works his way through the cars toward the rear.

               Angel spots him. Knife still in hand, he pulls Diana from 
               car to car past the terrified passengers until finally he is 
               cornered at the end of the train. Angel searches frantically 
               for a way out.

               Eddie enters. Diana sees him.

</b>                         You don't have the balls.

               Eddie takes another step.

               Diana slams her elbow into Angel's groin, and breaks free.

               Angel jumps back. He breaks open the rear door and climbs 
               out.

<b>               EXT. EL TRAIN - DAY
</b>
               Angel climbs up the back of the car onto the roof.

               Eddie's right behind him.

               The spectacular pursuit from car to car on the roof of the 
               speeding el train is witnessed by startled second-floor 
               secretaries whose desks look directly out at the roof of the 
               passing cars.

<b>               VERY HIGH ANGLE

               Angel and Eddie's figures appear as specks, roaring through 
               the canyon of skyscrapers.

<b>               ON TRAIN ROOF
</b>
               A low bridge forces both men to hug the roof of the train. 
               Eddie recovers first and grabs Angel, pulling him down. They 
               roll from side to side on the roof, nearly slipping over the 
               side. With a desperate shove, Angel breaks free. Eddie points 
               his gun at him. The train is now over the Chicago River. 
               Angel dives into the water.

               Eddie reholsters his gun and dives in after him.

               We see Diana's looking out the window of the train. She 
               follows Eddie's decent with her eyes.

</b>
               Dozens of startled pedestrians line the bridge railing as 
               Eddie swims toward Angel, bobbing in the middle of the stream.

               A hotdogger in a speedboat is racing up the river and Angel 
               is directly in his path. The skipper, showing off for his 
               passengers, doesn't notice him until he hears the sickening 
               THUNK under the keel. The boat's wake is suddenly red with 
               blood.

<b>               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

               Eddie is helped from the water by a couple of passersby.

               He stands there, soaking wet, looking around.

               A crowd is gathering. We hear SIRENS in the background. Then 
               he spots her.

               Diana is standing on the bridge watching him.

               Eddie, now in dry clothes, and Diana walk along the lagoon.

               by two girls, foot up on a chair, entertains a small crowd.

               A group laughs at the story. There is a stillness at the 
               front door. One of the hoods from outside steps in. He wears 
               a leather coat.

               The heads at the bar turn.

               He walks the length of the bar and enters the john. He is 
               obviously out of place in this saloon. Nobody has both hands 
               on the bar.

               The front door opens. The other hood steps in, walks up to 
               the bar, and orders.

               The First Hood comes out of the bathroom and walks up to the

               The room is frozen. Only the JUKEBOX makes a sound. The two 
               hoods, eyes fixed on the array of iron pointed at them, can't

               The cops swarm the hoods and in an instant they are on the

               Eddie leans back in his seat. A couple of people get up and

               Across the hall, Pirelli's door opens, and Pirelli, holding 
               his pistol steps into the hall.

               The Comachos turn and fire, blasting Pirelli back into his

               Eddie squeals to a stop, hops out of the car, starts for the

               Eddie enters the poolhall.

               The place is busy. Everybody in sight is either mean or ugly. 
               Eddie enters and a dozen pair of eyes are on him.

               The pool players not connected with this confrontation take 
               one look at him, hang up their cues, and split.

               Eddie heads for the back of the room. A pair of heavyweights 
               fall in behind him. One of them grabs Eddie.

               Eddie spins with deadly precision and catches them in mid-
               step and they go down like gut-shot rhinos.

               He heads for the rear hallway and everybody clears a path.

               He steps up to the door in back and kicks it in.

               Eddie grabs Degas by the hair and starts slamming his face 
               into the mirror which shatters with every blow.

                         for a right.

               He holds up Degas' head to look him in the eye. Blood and 
               cocaine stain the man's face.

               Eddie lifts the head once and gives Degas one punch in the 
               face that sends him ass over teakettle across the floor.

               Eddie opens the door and emerges from the back room. A dozen 
               Comacho goons have gathered. Behind them are another two 
               dozen hostile spectators. But no sign of the backup.

               He pulls out his gun. The remaining innocent bystanders split 
               for the exit. Eddie walks forward into the room. The Comachos 
               and their soldiers stand around him. Several have guns.

               Eddie keeps them under the point of his gun. He gets to the 
               door and has to turn his back on it to keep the gang in his 
               sights.

               A gun is pressed into Eddie's back. He drops his gun.

               Luis kicks Eddie across the room. Eddie lands at the feet of 
               the gang.

               Eddie springs to his feet, and in the same motion decks his 
               nearest attacker. The battle is on. Hardwood pool cues crack 
               around him.

               The first four or five never get a chance to lay a finger on 
               him. Battered and broken, they litter the billiard tables 
               and floor. But Eddie is outnumbered 20 to 1.

               Coming at Eddie now from all sides, the Comachos wear into 
               him. Finally they begin to connect. Blind-sided, he goes 
               down and they are on him like jackals.

               They drag him to the top of the rear stairs, and kick him 
               down to the alley.

               It seems like they are about to finish him off when suddenly 
               all is quiet. The crowd parts. Eddie looks up through swollen 
               eyes to see Luis Comacho standing above him, cool as ice. 
               Luis reaches down and pulls Eddie's head up by the ear.

</b>
               The Cadillac zooms up from below, crosses the intersection, 
               and immediately takes the next down-ramp. Eddie flies up 
               from below, briefly airborne, barreling after them into the

               A block later the Cadillac heads topside again. Eddie takes 
               a gamble and goes straight ahead.

               find themselves doing 70 knots side by side with Eddie in 
               the other lane.

               In the narrow concrete tunnel, the two cars battle each other 
               like bulls in a chute, each one trying to cut the other off, 
               bouncing from each other into the walls and back again.

               Tony sees his chance and he lunges for the gun. In the 
               struggle, the gun goes off and drills Rocco, the driver, 
               through the side of the head.

               The Cadillac ROARS out of control, its dead driver's foot

               Eddie is all over the road trying to avoid them. The river 
               and the curve are ahead.

               Scalese's car hits the median at high speed, rolls, and slides 
               SCREAMING into a concrete pillar and EXPLODES.

               Eddie stands on the brakes as his car slides alongside the

               With the flames still lighting his face, Eddie is making a 
               call.

               Diana is in bad shape. She is tied up. Numb with terror she 
               listens, not comprehending, as the Comachos discuss their 
               plans for her in Spanish.

               Luis comes over to her, and with his knife begins cutting 
               off part of her clothes.

               Eddie's car is totally ablaze. He walks past the streaming 
               hoses and slips into a parked blue and white, it's mars lights 
               still flashing. He roars off.

               The giant door opens, and a lone blue and white pulls in and 
               parks.

               The place is deserted except for the duty officer who sits 
               in his tiny office watching television with his half-naked 
               girlfriend.

               Eddie enters silently, glances into the duty office, and 
               heads to the other end of the large hall.

               In the background we see the practice apartment set, the 
               boxing ring, and several special task force undercover 
               vehicles seen before.

</b>
               Eddie opens his locker and takes out his sawed-off automatic 
               shotgun. He checks the action. He loads it. He fills a duffle 
               bag with ammo and drops in another gun. He closes the locker 
               and heads out.

               The duty officer is still occupied. Eddie eases past him and 
               checks the key-board at the desk. He finds what he's looking 
               for. He lifts a set of keys from the hook.

               This city garbage van, an immense blue semi-trailer, is moving 
               south on the Dan Ryan at incredible speed, pushing traffic 
               out of the way like a battleship slicing through Sunday

               Among the dockside ruins of the old facility, Luis carefully 
               checks his snipers and lookouts. Shouting in Spanish, he 
               directs them into position.

               From the distance we see a signal from the Comacho stationed 
               at the top of a huge grain elevator overlooking the Calumet 
               Harbor.

               Kosalas enters. The place is in chaos. He joins the crowd

               are here. So is Music. Commander Kates has just arrived.

               Kosalas wanders through the wreckage. He is stunned. He is 
               starting to wake up.

               The men all look at him silently.

               Kosalas turns on them.

               Cragie jumps at Kosalas, but Kosalas is ready for him, and 
               braces Cragie against the wall.

               With one hand Kosalas slams Cragie again, and reaches down 
               with his free hand, lifting Cragie's pants leg and extracting 
               a drop-gun from it's concealed holster.

               Diana, now hanging from her wrists like a slab of beef, is

               From the lookout's POV atop the towering grain elevator, WE 
               SEE several garbage trucks moving in and out of an adjacent 
               dump.

               One of them seems familiar to us.

               Eddie's eyes search the harbour as he maneuvers slowly

               Eddie opens the rear of the truck and lowers a ramp.

               He picks up his gun and a duffle bag from the cab and heads 
               out.

               The Comachos are ready and waiting. Luis walks through the 
               middle of the vast empty plant toward the front, checking on 
               his troops one last time.

<b>               EXT. DOCK - DAY

               Against the grotesque shapes of the surrounding scrapyards, 
               Eddie moves quickly from one concealment to the next, crouched 
               low, advancing on the abandoned factory at the end of the 
               dock.

               He lays down his duffle and pulls out a Halliburton case. He 
               opens it.

<b>               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               From inside the garbage truck WE HEAR an ENGINE STARTING. It 
               REVS a couple of times. And from within the container 
               compartment of the truck emerges the Prowler. It clatters 
               down the ramp.

<b>               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY

               The lookout spots the Prowler moving down the dock. He can't 
               believe his eyes.

               He sights on the machine and FIRES.

               And in the distance, the Prowler senses the insult and 
               immediately turns its camera eye up to him.

               The lookout FIRES again. Immediately, the turret swivels and 
               the twin MACHINEGUNS ROAR.

               It's a long way down.

               The SOUND of MACHINEGUN FIRE from outside galvanizes the 
               Comachos. Luis runs through the long building toward the 
               front with half a dozen of his men, all SHOUTING.

               Eddies eyes watch the miniature monitor of the Prowler's 
               hand controller. On the monitor WE CAN SEE the Comachos 
               running out in the front of the factory from the camera on 
               top of the Prowler.

               Eddie gets up and moves toward the factory. He looks up at 
               several high broken windows.

<b>               EXT. DOCK - DAY

               The Prowler is having a field day. It's electronic sensors 
               trace the source of every hostile shot and immediately return 
               a withering stream of hot lead that chews the surrounding 
               scenery -- and several Comachos -- to pieces.

               But Eddie has not figured out how to control the Prowler's 
               BULLHORN VOICE command system. It continues to BARK ORDERS 
               to the dead hoodlums in three languages.

               Diana, tied to the chair, is momentarily alone as the guards 
               rush out to the floor of the factory to see what's happening.

               The two guards, their guns flying from their hands, are 
               hammered back into the room by Eddie who blasts through the

               The "Prowler" rolls around the corner, its brutal turret 
               bristling with firepower. It is driving Luis and the other 
               stupefied Comachos further back into the building.

               Eddie guides his deadly partner with the hand controller.

               The Comachos dive for cover and spray the miniature tank 
               with AUTOMATIC FIRE. But they are no match. Two continuous 
               streams of hot lead chew up the place, splintering the loading 
               dock and the catwalk hiding places and disintegrating the 
               structure, churning the Comachos to hamburger.

<b>               COMACHO SHOT RINGS OUT

               Eddie goes down and the Prowler hand controller falls to the 
               ground, shattered.

               The Prowler goes berserk, SPRAYING DEATH in a 360 degree 
               circle until all the ammo is gone.

               Then SILENCE.

               Eddie touches the blood on the side of his leg. It's not 
               serious.

               It appears everyone is out of ammunition. But a few Comachos 
               are still hidden in the factory.

               Eddie is after them like a tiger. Victor, shoulder still 
               bandaged, never has a chance. He goes down, battered and 
               broken.

               But Luis has crept up behind Eddie. He jumps over a steel 
               plate. He's going for Diana, a long knife in his hand.

               Eddie reaches for a reload. Puts it in his magnum. Aims, and 
               blows Luis away just as he reaches for Diana.

               Across the littered battlefield, Eddie escorts Diana toward

               The bodies of the Comachos lying everywhere astound the

               Officer Kosalas screeches to a halt and jumps from his car.

               Eddie hands Diana over to the waiting medics, who put her in 
               the ambulance.

               We pull back further and further until we see the rest of 
               the Home Team. The ambulance, carrying Diana, pulls away 
               with it's lights flashing.

               Eddie walks down the pier alone.
