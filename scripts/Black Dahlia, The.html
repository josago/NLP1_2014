<b>     CREDITS ROLL OVER
</b>
     Black and white newsreel footage from the 1930s. Clips from
     prize fights featuring two different boxers against various
     opponents. One a light heavyweight--pure finesse, a
     counterpunches; the other, stouter and stronger, a
     headhunting puncher.

     The intercutting of the two fighters suggests a possible
     showdown at the end of the newsreel. No such luck.

<b>     END CREDITS

<b>     CLOSE UP ON:
</b>
     A TRIPLE CARBON LAPD "INCIDENT REPORT" FORM trapped in an old
     Corona typewriter. The keys pound letters into the blank
     spaces.

<b>     INCIDENT: THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTS...JUNE 10, 1943...
</b><b>     REPORTING OFFICER...DWIGHT "BUCKY" BLEICHERT
</b>
<b>     EXT. BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK
</b>
     A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent
     LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The
     sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop
     for their arrival.

     We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT, 26, (The counterpuncher from
     the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier.

     Bucky's minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three
     pound truncheon.

<b>     BUCKY'S POV:
</b>
     Hundreds of in-uniform GI's use baseball bats and two-by-
     fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans.

     Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and
     hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol who've chosen
     to "restore order" by cheering on their countrymen against
     the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters.

     Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows. Darkness falls
     quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos.

     Suddenly Bucky's RUNNING--

     away from the action...

     down a side street and onto a

<b>     QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK.
</b>
     He slows to a jog, trying to gather his thoughts. And then a
     voice:

<b>                          VOICE
</b>               Bleichert! Bleichert!

<b>     EXT. A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME
</b>
     A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE
     ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway.

     The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by-
     fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet,
     dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               I already knew him by reputation, had our
               respective records down pat: Lee
               Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight,
               formerly a regular attraction at the
               Hollywood Legion Stadium.

     The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard,
     trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the
     marines' blows with his own truncheon.

<b>                          LEE BLANCHARD
</b>               Code three, Bleichert!

     Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in,
     fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light-
               heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring
               magazine in 1937 fighting no-name
               opponents in no-man's-land division.

     On instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the
     marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft
     midsections.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               In our first year at Central we'd never
               spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions
               about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard
               fight, and who would win.

     And now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows
     to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into
     a heap.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by
               early KO; Bleichert by decision;
               Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but
               Bleichert by knockout.

     The marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his
     attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads
     him away. He motions for Bucky to follow.

     Lee turns back to the marines:

<b>                          LEE
</b>               To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.

     One of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest
     as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing.

     The three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be
     heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night.

                          LEE (cont'd)
                   (re the Zooter)
               Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos
               Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive
               warrant for manslaughter committed during
               the commission of a Class B Felony.

               keeled of a heart attack.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          LEE
</b>                   (smiling)
               I came all the way down here same as you
               did.
                   (jerks a finger to the riots)
               Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see
               those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--
                   (nudging Dos Santos)
               Habla Ingles, Tomas?

     The man shakes his head "no".

                          LEE (cont'd)
               He's dead meat. Manslaughter Two's a gas
               chamber jolt for spics. Hepcat here's
               about six weeks away from the Big Adios.
               Been better off getting a couple cracked
               ribs from our Privates First Class back
               there.

     Blanchard spies a home with newspapers stacked on the front
     porch.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               We'll never get him booked tonight.

<b>     INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER
</b>
     Tomas Dos Santos cuffed by his ankles to a radiator. The
     three men are on their second fifth of Cutty Sark swiped from
     the kitchen cupboard.

     Dos Santos sings a drunken Spanish version of "The
     Chattanooga Choo Choo" before slumping to his side and
     passing out.

     Bucky covers him with a blanket.

<b>                          LEE

               Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there
               wets his pants for fighters. Promised me
               the next spot he can wangle.

<b>                          BUCKY

               Impressive.

<b>                          LEE
</b>                   (not impressed either)
               Wanna hear something more impressive? My
               first twenty fights were stumblebums
               handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend
               saw you fight a couple times over at the
               Olympic. Says maybe you could take me.

     Lee gets up and wanders into the living room. From the
     kitchen Bucky watches Lee stare out at the flames.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Whatta we do about the Mex?

<b>                          LEE

     screaming in silence.

<b>     AS WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
     Tomas Dos Santos dying in a large Plexiglas GAS CHAMBER.
     Bucky stands in the back of the room, forcing himself to
     watch. He can't stand it and leaves.

<b>     IN THE FRONT ROW
</b>
     Lee also watches, elbows on knees and chin in hands. He can't
     stand it, either. He stays.

<b>     IN THE HALLWAY AFTERWARDS
</b>
     Bucky watches from afar as men in suits shake Lee's hand and
     brush imaginary lint off of his BRAND NEW SERGEANT'S STRIPES.
     Their eyes meet briefly as Bucky retreats to daylight.

     An extremely bored Bucky Bleichert gives a man a speeding
     ticket and sends him on his way.

<b>     EXT./INT. RADIO PATROL CAR - MOVING

     Bucky drives as a ROOKIE COP chatters in the seat next to
     him.

<b>                          ROOKIE
</b>               Yep, three years in the Canal Zone.
               Nothin' but skeeter bites and drunk
               fights over three-dollar skank tail...

<b>     INT. THE CENTRAL MUSTER ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Bucky sits at his desk filling out a form as the rookie cop
     prattles on in the background.

<b>                          ROOKIE
</b>               ...fights over three-dollar skank tail...

<b>     AN OLDER OFFICER
</b>
     walks by the rookie and rolls his eyes. Catching Bucky's
     look, the cop throws him a shadow punching one-two. Bucky
     smiles thinly. Returns to his paperwork. Then another cop
     passes by and breaks into a bob-and-weave. Bucky looks
     puzzled and annoyed.

     He grabs a third cop walking by (TOM JOSLIN).

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Somethin' up, Tommy?

<b>                          TOM
</b>               You, that's what.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               You know Lee Blanchard over at Central
               Warrants?

     Bucky nods.

<b>                          TOM
</b>               His partner's toppin' his twenty and
               goin' for early retirement. Word is the

               fill the spot. Christ knows why but it's
               down to you and Johnny Vogel for the
               spot.

     Bucky takes a surreptitious peek across the room at JOHNNY
     VOGEL, fat, slick-hair and bad skin.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               His old man Fritzie's a Central Dick.

<b>                          TOM
</b>                   (chucking Bucky on the chin)
               But who'd look better when they bring back
               the boxing team, eh Buckaroo?

     Bucky shakes his head, dismissing the whole thing.

<b>     INT. THE RADIO PATROL CAR - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
     Bucky drives on as the rookie talks and talks...

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               Warrants was local celebrity as a cop.
               Warrants was plainclothes without a coat
               and tie, romance and a mileage per diem
               on your civilian car. Warrants was going
               after the real bad guys and not rousting
               winos and wienie waggers in front of the
               Midnight Mission.

<b>     INT. BUCKY'S GARAGE - NIGHT

     Bucky hits a speed-bag, building up a sweat.

<b>                          VOICE OVER

     He hits the bag faster and faster.

     A desk officer hands Bucky a note.

     Inside the office: Lee Blanchard, ASST. D.A. ELLIS LOEW, and
     CHIEF THAD GREEN. They all sit in matched leather chairs.

<b>                          SECRETARY
</b>               Officer Bleichert.

     She exits. An awkward silence.

               Gentlemen, Bucky Bleichert. Bucky, Chief
               Thad Green, Deputy DA Ellis Loew.

     Bucky shakes their hands, nodding to each.  Chief Green
     gestures for him to sit.

<b>                          CHIEF GREEN
</b>               Read this aloud, Officer. It's running in

</b>               "Before the war, the City of the Angels
               was graced with two local fighters, born
               and raised a scant five miles apart,
               pugilists with styles as different as
               fire and ice. Lee Blanchard was a
               bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger--

<b>                          CHIEF GREEN
</b>               Skip down to the fire and ice part.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>                   (searching, finding)
               "Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each
               other, but a sense of duty brought them
               together in spirit, and both joined the
               Los Angeles Police Department." Blanchard
               cracked the baffling Boulevard-Citizens
               bank robbery case in 1939 and captured
               thrill-killer Tomas Dos Santos; Bleichert
               served with distinction during the '43

     A glance to Lee...

<b>                          CHIEF GREEN

<b>                          BUCKY

</b>               It's not like you'll last the ten rounds
               anyway.

     Bucky eyes Lee quickly, assessing his larger but slightly
     softer physique.

     All the remaining eyes are on him.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>     EXT. THE CITY HALL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATEER

     Bucky exits and sees Lee leaning against an unmarked car
     talking with a striking woman in an auburn pageboy cut.

     Lee waves Bucky over.

<b>                          LEE

     Lee puts his arm around her.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't
               want me doin' the "vegetable shuffle."

     He staggers around like a punch-drunk fighter.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I'll try not to hurt you.

     A flicker of anger in her eyes.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Sure make Loew happy.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               He's got money on me, I gather?

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Seems that way.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               And if I win I get Warrants?

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Seems that way.

     Bucky shakes his head. Turns to Kay.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               What do you think of all this, Miss Lake?

<b>                          KAY
</b>               For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets
               ridiculed for perpetrating this farce.
               For financial reasons I hope Lee wins.
               And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both
               look good with your shirts off.

     Bucky and Lee break into laughter. Bucky sticks out his hand.
     Lee takes it.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Luck short of winning.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               You, too.

     Bucky tips his hat to Kay and turns to go.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Luck, Dwight.

     He stops at hearing his real name. But he knows she's waiting
     to see his reaction so he keeps walking...

<b>     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - LINCOLN HEIGHTS - DAY
</b>
     Bucky pulls up in front of a small ugly house in a tired
     neighborhood. He exits the car carrying a cardboard box full
     of canned goods and old girlie magazines.

<b>     ON THE PORCH OF THE HOUSE
</b>
     a bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a BB pistol at
     some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard.

<b>     ON BUCKY'S FACE
</b>
     disgust and sadness.

     This is DOLPH BLEICHERT, Bucky's father. Bucky approaches,
     pulling a chair up next to his father. Up close it's even
     worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow
     rimming his rheumy eyes. Flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy
     shirt.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Papa?

<b>                          DOLPH
</b>               Guten tag, Dwight.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Speak English, papa.

<b>                          DOLPH
</b>               Englisch Schiesser! Amerikan Schiesser!

     He aims the BB gun and fires at an airplane: the gun's empty.

     Bucky enters the house. Half-eaten cans of beans on the
     dining room table, an entire legion of broken balsa wood
     airplane kits. Alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen,
     nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans...

<b>     BACK ON THE PORCH
</b>
     Dolph leans on the porch rail. Bucky returns.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me
               how you can fuck this place up so bad in
               one month.

<b>                          DOLPH

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Speak...English. Papa, please.

     He searches his father's eyes for a response and gets none.

     He surveys the house again. Somewhere in the corner of his
     eye we see the glint of an idea...

<b>     INSIDE THE HOUSE

     Bucky on the phone.

     Mentally fighting the sparring partner's fight.

     Bucky sits at a desk with an assistant manager and fills out

     Bucky slides him the forms. The manager slides him the cash.

     --scar tissue over Lee's right eye

     --Lee dropping his left when throwing the right hook

     --Lee tucking his elbows too tight and opening up his ribcage

     An armored truck idles in front of the Boulevard-Citizens

     front of the bank, an alarm keening in the background.

     Three police cars converge on the scene and a gun battle
     ensues... Two of the bank robbers are shot as the third man
     (the one carrying the money) jumps into the truck. The truck
     takes off, able to escape when someone from inside the truck
     throws open the doors and pushes the naked and bound
     legitimate guards out the back and into the line of
     pursuit...

<b>     INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - MORNING
</b>
     A door marked "DETECTIVE'S MUSTER ROOM". Bucky, wearing his
     best SPORTS COAT AND SLACKS, pushes through the door.

<b>     INSIDE THE MUSTER ROOM
</b>
     Full of the LAPD's plainclothes hotshots. All stand and give
     Bucky a standing ovation. Lee's there, too, playing to the
     crowd.

     On the blackboard at the front of the room: 8%!!!

     CAPTAIN JACK TIERNEY is at the podium.

<b>                          TIERNEY
</b>                   (as introduction)
               Officer Bleichert, the men of Central
               Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et
               cetera. I'm Captain Jack Tierney. You and
               Lee are the white men of the hour, so I
               hope you enjoyed your ovation. You won't
               get another one until you retire.

     Everyone laughs. Tierney raps the podium and speaks again.

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               Enough horseshit. This is the felony
               summary for the week ending November 14,
               1946. First, three liquor store
               stickups...

     Tierney begins the summary as Bucky's eyes wander around the
     room, taking in his new surroundings... Older men, coats and
     ties... He tunes back in...

                          TIERNEY (cont'd)
               And here's a collar'd please Cap'n Jack
               to no end. Sergeants Vogel, Koenig, have
               you read the SID memos on the Bunker Hill
               burglaries?

     FRITZ VOGEL AND BILL KOENIG, both hulking and unpleasant-
     looking (Fritzie being the elder version of his son Johnny).
     The two men shake their heads "no". Tierney disapproves.

               Set of latents at the last break-in ID's
               one Maynard Coleman, two sodomy priors. A
               surefire baby raper. Highland Park's got
               four child sodomy unsolveds. Maybe he's
               our boy, maybe not. But between that and
               the B&E's I'd put Maynard as a high
               priority lamster right now. There's a
               list of his known associates on the
               bulletin board. Let's all take a look...

<b>     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER
</b>
     The meeting's breaking up. A tall, elegant man (RUSS MILLARD)
     and a squat disheveled man (HARRY SEARS) approach Bucky.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>                   (introducing himself)
               Russ Millard, homicides. Wife and kids
               thank you for the raise, Officer.

     Bucky smiles a dumb smile, not knowing what to say.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
                   (re the other man)
               My partner, Harry Sears.

<b>                          HARRY

               Y-y-y-yes.  Th-th-thanks Officer B-B-
               Bleichert.

     Before Bucky can answer ELLIS LOEW grabs him by the elbow and
     leads him away.

<b>                          ELLIS LOEW
</b>               Officer Bleichert. Welcome to Central
               Warrants--

     When he gets him out of ear shot:

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               You shouldn't have slugged with him. You
               were ahead on all three cards.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               The proposition passed, sir.

<b>                          ELLIS LOEW
</b>               Yes but some of your patron's lost money.
               Play things smarter here. Don't blow this
               like you blew the fight.

     Bucky's about to respond when Lee saves him--

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Ready to roll, canvasback?

     He grabs Bucky and they head out the door.

<b>     INT. LEE'S CAR - LATER
</b>
     Lee cruises them through downtown, rambling about the job
     description.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Why'd you really quit fighting?

     He pulls the car into a parking lot of a Mexican restaurant.

<b>                          LEE
</b>                   (matter of fact)
               Benny Siegel bought out my contract,
               scared off my manager. Said he'd get me a
               shot at Joe Louis if I'd take two dives
               for him. I said no, joined the Department
               'cuz Jew syndicate boys won't kill cops.
               Anything else?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>                   (as they exit the car)
               One more. What are we doin' here?

<b>                          LEE
</b>               While you were dancing with Ellis at
               muster I checked Maynard Coleman's KA's
               on the bulletin and recognized the name
               of a fence. Think he tends bar here...

<b>     INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
</b>
     Lee and Bucky slide into a booth on either side of BRUNO
     ALBANESE, halfway through plate of huevos rancheros.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Bruno Albanese?

<b>                          BRUNO
</b>               Who wants to know?

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Police officers, Bruno. Let's make this
               fast so I don't have to watch you eat.

     Lee slides the Maynard Coleman mug shot to Albanese.

                          LEE (cont'd)
               We know he sells to you and we don't
               care. Where is he?

     Albanese burps.

<b>                          BRUNO
</b>               Never seen 'em before.

     Lee sighs. And then grabs Bruno by the back of the neck and
     jams his face into the hot cheese and goo of his food.
     Bruno's arms flap back and forth as Lee drowns him in his
     food.

     Finally Lee shrugs and pulls Bruno's face out of his food,
     blood from his nose mixing with the grease of the enchiladas.

<b>                          BRUNO
</b>               Versailles apartments. Sixth and St.
               Andrews.

<b>     EXT. THE VERSAILLES APARTMENTS - MINUTES LATER
</b>
     Lee and Bucky pull up and look for a parking spot just as
     MAYNARD COLEMAN trots down the front stairs and gets into a
     car.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Right there!

     They ease the car back into traffic and follow Coleman's car
     from a safe distance. Bucky picks up the two-way radio. Lee
     gestures for him to put it back:

     Coleman's pulling into the parking lot of THE POLAR PALACE,
     an ICE SKATING RINK. They follow.

     Coleman exits his car, eyeing a group of kids carrying ice
     skates and heading into the Polar Palace. He follows them
     inside...

     The two men follow...

<b>     INSIDE THE POLAR PALACE
</b>
     Children skate around on the ice with a giant polar bear
     suit. Lee and Bucky scan the area--not an adult in sight. Lee
     spots some stairs leading to the restrooms and gestures to
     Bucky, who hustles down them.

<b>     ON THE STAIRCASE
</b>
     Maynard Coleman, carrying a stuffed bunny rabbit, walks up
     the stairs toward Bucky. Just as the two men pass Bucky PULLS
     HIS GUN and puts it to Coleman's head.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Police officer. You're under arrest.

     Coleman throws his hands in the air; the bunny drops to the
     ground. Bucky cuffs Coleman and leads him up the stairs as
     Lee comes down from above.

     A small voice from below Bucky:

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               Let go of him! Let go of him!

     Bucky looks down to see A SMALL BOY pounding on his leg. The
     kid's hysterical.

<b>                          BOY
</b>               Let go a my daddy! Daddy!

     The resemblance is unmistakable. Two generations of Okie
     white trash. Bucky continues marching Coleman the elder up
     the stairs as Lee snags the kid, both the father and the son
     crying like babies.

<b>     INT. THE HALL OF JUSTICE JAIL - LATER
</b>
     Lee and Bucky fill out a release form for the desk officer.

     Bucky looks up to see BILL KOENIG and FRITZ VOGEL march by
     with barely a nod.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               They got here fast.
                   (off Bucky's look)
               The confession.

<b>     INT. CENTRAL WARRANTS - LATER
</b>
     Lee finishes typing up a report on a manual typewriter while
     Bucky talks on the phone. He hangs up as Fritz Vogel and Bill
     Koenig return.

                          LEE (cont'd)
                   (re the two meatheads)
               Play nice. They've got juice with Loew.

<b>                          KOENIG
</b>                   (stupid and proud)
               He confessed. Kiddie porks and the
               burglaries. Fritzie says we're all
               getting commendations.

     Bucky's POV: both Koenig and Vogel have small bits of
     blood spattered on their white dress shirts.

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               Ellis loves the kid angle.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               You talk to Ellis?

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               He's only "Ellis" to lieutenants on up,
               Blanchard.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Least I don't call him "kike".

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>                   (flushing)
               C'mon, Billy.

     The two men push by with barely a nod in Bucky's direction.
<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Play nice. Hm.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Shitbirds.

     HARRY SEARS approaches their cubicle. He looks a little
     drunk. (And when you get to know him you'll realize that when
     he's drunk he doesn't stutter.)

<b>                          HARRY
</b>               Russ says good collar today.

     The men nod thanks. Bucky notes the lack of stutter and the
     presence of a liquor smell.

                          HARRY (cont'd)
               And Lee--I heard something you oughta
               know--I was over at County Parole--Bobby
               DeWitt got an "A" number. He'll be
               released to LA around mid-January.

     Lee bobs his head slightly as Harry moves off. He's disturbed
     but covers quickly--

<b>                          LEE
</b>               You like pot roast?

<b>     EXT. A BEAUTIFUL DECO HOME - NIGHT
</b>
     Lee leads Bucky up the walk. Bucky's impressed with the house.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Don't say anything to Kay about DeWitt.
               It'll upset her.

<b>     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     A doll's house of Danish Modern furniture, fresh flowers and
     polished mahogany wainscoting.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Fight stash.

     Kay arrives from the kitchen, smiling broadly at Bucky. She
     takes his hand.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Hello, Dwight. Glad you could make it.

     And holds his hand about two beats than usual...

<b>     INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER
</b>
     Kay brings in the food. Bucky walks around the room, checking
     things out.

<b>                          FAY
</b>               Fairy tale come true, isn't it?

<b>                          BUCKY

</b>               The house. You and Lee partners. Fairy
               tale.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Can't say I believe in fairy tales.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Then you've never really had to. Lucky
               man. (beat) Lee! Dinner!

<b>     INT. THE DINING ROOM - LATER
</b>
     The food is finished. So is a bottle of champagne. Kay pops
     another one, hitting Lee in the chest with the cork. Everyone
     laughs hysterically. They fill the glasses again.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               A toast...To Proposition B!

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          KAY

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>                   (abruptly, drunk)
               To...us!

     He's referring to all three of them--something which doesn't
     escape or displease anyone. They clink glasses and drink.

<b>     ANOTHER LAPD TRIPLE CARBON INCIDENT REPORT:

<b>     INT. ELLIS LOEW'S OFFICE - MORNING
</b>
     Lee and Bucky enter the Loew's inner sanctum where they are
     joined by Russ Millard and Harry Sears. A stack of L.A.

     Heralds sit on the desk, the top one folded to the headline:
     "Criminal Division's DA to try for Boss's Job in '48
     Primary?"

     Bucky's look of disgust says it all just as Loew walks into
     the room--

     A montage of shots as Lee and Bucky cruise south on Crenshaw 
     Boulevard. The beginning of the post-war boom.

               and I captured a total of eleven hard
               felons, eighteen traffic warrantees and
               three parole and probation absconders...

     On Crenshaw's northern end, once grand and now dilapidated
     houses in the process of demolition, their faces replaced by
     giant billboards advertising department stores, jumbo
     shopping centers and movie theaters.

               made dinner for us, other times the three
               of us would go dancing, or see a flick.

     Southbound, older wooden structures looking more and more

     Lee pulls the car into the parking lot. Jumping out of the
     car--

<b>                          LEE
</b>               This grand tour stuff's for shit. I'm
               callin' in some favors.

     He heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it.

<b>     BACK IN THE CAR - MINUTES LATER
</b>
     Lee gets back in the car. He's pale, sweating.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Got a tip. Snitch a mine says he's
               shacking with some poon in a crib near
               Slauson and Hoover.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               We fuckin' roll.

     He pulls out.

<b>     EXT./INT. THE CAR - HOOVER AVE - MINUTES LATER
</b>
     Lee and Bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner.
     Three are black and one is white.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Hopheads. Let's shake 'em for an address
               or a name.

     As Lee and Bucky exit the car, the four men immediately start
     the slow walk to the wall, arms over their heads. The white
     guy glances at Lee:

<b>                          WHITE HOPHEAD
</b>               What the---Blanchard?

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Shut up, shitbird.

     Lee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him.
     Bucky starts with one of the other men, pulling out some
     marijuana cigarettes.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Bucky sees the black man
     closest to Lee reaches for something shiny in his belt--

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Partner!

     Bucky pulls his .38...

     THE WHITE GUY swings around and LEE SHOOTS HIM twice in the
     face--

     THE FIRST BLACK MAN pulls a SHIV free and BUCKY SHOOTS HIM in
     the neck--

     ANOTHER OF THE MEN goes for his trousers, fumbling for
     something as BUCKY SHOOTS HIM THREE TIMES.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Bucky duck!

     Bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of Lee and
     the last man drawing guns on each other--Lee's three shots
     cutting down the man before he can fire his tiny derringer.

     Bucky pulls himself to his feet, stumbling past the blood-
     covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter.

<b>     FROM THE DISTANCE: THE SOUND OF SIRENS.
</b>
     Bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket.
     Behind him, Lee is busy turning the dead men's pockets inside
     out--scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from
     the blood.

     All the while Lee cries like a baby.

<b>     INT. THE 77TH ST. DETECTIVES' STATION - LATER
</b>
     Bucky and a Detective exit a de-briefing room. Bucky looks
     worn but composed.

<b>                          DETECTIVE
</b>               Thank you for your time, Officer. And
               your police work, as well.

     They pass another de-briefing area where Lee sits with
     another Detective. Lee looks terrible, muttering and
     shivering.

                          DETECTIVE (cont'd)
               Your partner's taking this hard.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               He knew one of the guys. Baxter Fitch.
               Busted him once for loitering. Sort of
               liked the guy.

     The detective nods sympathetically.

<b>     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Lee and Bucky walk up the front steps where they're met by
     Kay. She runs to Lee and embraces him.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Oh baby. Oh babe.

     She escorts him into the house. Bucky sees a newspaper on the
     front porch railing. The evening edition of The Mirror.

     "Boxer Cops in Gun Battle. Four Crooks Dead."

     Publicity boxing photos accompany a full-page article. Bucky
     begins to read it when he hears from inside:

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Leave me alone! You'll never fucking
               understand--

     A door slam. Soon after the sound of Lee's motorcycle roaring
     off... After a beat Kay comes outside and sits down next to
     Bucky.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               He knew one of the guys.

     She nods.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               It was them or us.

     She nods again.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Tomorrow's off-duty so treat him nice--

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight.
               We're on edge. He swore at the trial he
               was going to kill Lee.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               We can take care of Bobby DeWitt.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Lee's scared. You don't know Bobby.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I know as much as I need to know.

     Kay gives him a look: that's what you think. She gets up and
     goes inside. Not knowing what to do, Bucky continues reading
     the paper.

<b>     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - LATER
</b>
     Bucky wanders inside, obviously fidgety and not wanting to go
     home. He putters around their living room. From the back of
     the house Bucky hears the sound of A SHOWER RUNNING.

     Bucky walks back to the bathroom, drawn there by the sound of
     the drumming water. The bathroom door is open, an invitation.

     He stops at the threshold of the bathroom. His POV:

     Kay stands in the shower, curtain open for Bucky's benefit.
     She faces him and he takes in the view of her nakedness.

     Her attitude is not one of seduction, however, her expression
     passive and fixed even when their eyes meet. She pirouettes
     for him, showing:

<b>     A SERIES OF OLD KNIFE SCARS CRISS-CROSSING HER BACK FROM
</b><b>     THIGH TO SPINE.
</b>
     The history of Bobby DeWitt.

     Bucky backs away, retreating as he chokes back tears.

<b>     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
     Bucky's awakened by the phone ringing. He pulls the receiver
     off the cradle but leaves it on the nightstand. From the
     receiver he barely hears:

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Rise and shine partner!

     Bucky grabs the phone.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Lee? You okay?

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Sure. Ran Mulholland at a hundred and
               ten. Played house with Kay all day
               yesterday. Feel like doing some police
               work?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Keep going.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Junior Nash's got a fuck pad on Norton
               and Coliseum.

<b>     EXT. THE CORNER OF COLISEUM AND NORTON - SOON AFTER
</b>
     Bucky and Lee pull up to a mangy apartment building.

<b>     INT. RAYMOND NASH'S ROOM - SOON AFTER
</b>
     They push the door open to reveal a filthy little flop
     littered with muscatel short dogs and used rubbers.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Okie trash.

     They poke around for a minute, finding nothing. The smell is
     awful. Bucky goes to a window and pulls it open.

<b>     HIS POV OUT THE WINDOW:
</b>
<b>     IN A VACANT LOT ACROSS THE WAY
</b>
     A cluster of uniformed cops and men in civilian clothes stare
     at something in the weeds. A CORONER'S VAN parks next to
     three black and whites and two detectives' sedans.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Lee.

     Lee goes to the window.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Is that Millard and Sears?

     An LAPD PHOTO VAN pulls up next.

     Lee and Bucky sprint out of the room.

<b>     EXT. THE VACANT LOT - 39TH AND NORTON - SECONDS LATER
</b>
     Photo men have already begun fanning out and taking photos.
     Bucky sees Harry Sears take a shot from a hip flask in full
     view of other officers. Lee and Bucky elbow their way to the
     front and see:

     The nude, mutilated body of a young woman, cut in half at the
     waist. Another wide cut down her center reveal an empty
     cavity--her organs have been removed.

     Her face has been bashed in and her mouth cut ear to ear in a
     leering smile.

     Even the experienced cops are rattled by the scene. They
     point and whisper and generally begin to fall into disbelief
     and disorder when

<b>     RUSS MILLARD
</b>
     whistles harshly with his fingers in his mouth.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Before this gets out of hand let's put
               the kibosh on something. If this gets a
               lot of publicity we're going to get a lot
               of confessions. So we keep some things
               quiet. This girl was disemboweled. You
               keep this information to yourselves. Not
               your wives, not your girlfriends, no
               other officers.

     The men all nod, coming together as Millard takes control.

                          RUSS MILLARD (cont'd)
               No reporters view the body. You photo
               men, take your pictures now. Coroner's
               men, you put a sheet on the body as soon
               as they're done. Set up a perimeter six
               feet back. Any reporter crosses it,
               arrest him.
                   (noticing Bucky)
               Bleichert. What are you doing here?
               Where's Blanchard?

     Bucky indicates Lee, crouched down by the body taking notes.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Nash is renting a room in that building
               over there.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               No. This isn't him.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               The lab'll be the judge of that.

     Millard and Bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging
     onto Norton, beelining for the commotion. Reporters and
     photographers begin pouring out of their cars, quickly coming
     up against a line of cops keeping them from the body.

     Bucky makes his way over to Lee, unable to stop staring at
     the body.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Hey. Junior Nash, remember?

<b>                          LEE

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               No. He beat an old woman to death. That's
               why he's our priority warrantee.

<b>                          LEE

     Too sheet-covered stretchers are shoved into the coroner's

     Bucky gets out of his car and finds Lee standing inside the
     crime scene rope watching lab techs poke around in the weeds.
     The entire area is lit up by arclights, illuminating the two
     quicklime outlines of the body parts.

     Lee points to the body outline. His hand shakes a bit and
     maybe for the first time we sense he's wired on something.

     headline: "Hunt Werewolf's Den in Torture Slaying"

     Along a bench, five derelict-looking men are manacled to a

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Is it...all right to smoke, doctor?

<b>                          CORONER
</b>               She's not going to mind.

     Both Russ and Harry light up.

                          CORONER (cont'd)
               Lower half of the cadaver reveals removal
               of reproductive organs...Both legs broken
               at the knee, and healing, light lash
               marks on the upper back and shoulders...

     The door opens and a police officer enters, handing a sheet
     of paper to Millard and speaking to him briefly. Millard
     reads the sheet and hands it to Harry, who then hands it to
     Lee.

<b>                          LEE
</b>                   (reading)
               Bingo.

     He hands it to Bucky.

     The note: "Girl ID'd as Elizabeth Ann Short, DOB
     7/29/24, Medford, Mass."

     The coroner steps back from the table.

<b>                          CORONER
</b>               Questions?

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               What's your best guess?

<b>                          CORONER
</b>               Here's what she wasn't. She wasn't raped,
               she wasn't pregnant, dried semen
               indicates voluntary intercourse within
               the last week...She took what I'd call a
               gentle whipping in the last ten days...In
               terms of the nitty-gritty...She was
               probably tortured with a knife for thirty-
               six to forty-eight hours before death.
               The cause of which is either the mouth
               wound or more likely she was beaten to
               death with something like a baseball bat.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               What about her insides?

<b>                          CORONER
</b>               They came out after death. Then I'd say
               he drained the blood from the body and
               washed it clean, probably in a bathtub.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Did the guy know anything about medicine
               or anatomy?

<b>                          CORONER
</b>               Maybe. Probably not a surgeon type--but
               that doesn't rule out veterinary
               training, biological training, or my
               Pathology for Beginners class at UCLA.
               Has she got a name yet?

     The cops look to each other, hesitant to speak her name.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Elizabeth Short.

<b>                          CORONER
</b>                   (saluting heaven)
               God love you, Elizabeth.
                   (to Millard)
               Russell, when you get the son of a bitch
               who did this to her, give him a kick in
               the balls and tell him it's from
               Frederick D. Newbarr, M.D. Now all of you
               get out of here, I've got a date with a
               jumper suicide in ten minutes.

<b>     INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - LATER
</b>
     Jack Tierney posts mug shots of Elizabeth Short as Russ,
     Harry, Lee and Bucky look over his shoulder. (In the
     background we can hear the by-now constant droning of Ellis
     Loew to reporters, both in person and over the phone)

               clean. Four sisters. Parents divorced.
               Father's here in LA. Hear he sold some
               old portrait photos of her to the Herald.

     Russ makes a noise of disgust.

</b>               Too much publicity is a hindrance, Ellis.
               If you were a policeman you'd know that.

     Tierney looks to Millard. The second in command shakes his
     head ever so slightly. We understand that even though he's
     second in command to Jack he's in charge.

<b>     EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DUSK
</b>
     A garage apartment at the rear of a big Victorian house. Lee
     and Bucky amble up and ring the buzzer.

     A skinny man (CLEO SHORT) in his fifties opens the door,
     eyeing them narrowly.

<b>                          CLEO SHORT
</b>               Cops, huh?

     He leads them inside. The apartment resembles its resident,
     soiled, worn and ugly.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               I've got an alibi, just in case you think
               I did it. Tighter than a crab's ass, and
               that is air tight.

     The two cops sit down, sizing up his hostility.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I'm Detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This

<b>                          CLEO SHORT
</b>               I know who you are. Neither of you'da

               Jeffries.
               (beat) As for Betty, c'est la vie. She
               called the tune, she paid the piper.
               (beat) You wanna hear my alibi?

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Since you're so anxious to tell it.

<b>                          CLEO SHORT

               daughter?

<b>                          CLEO SHORT
</b>               Betty came west in '43 with stars in her
               eyes. I promised her three squares and a
               five-spot if she kept the house tidy.

     The cops look around at the squalor.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Gave her the boot in July. She moved to
               Santa Barbara. Sent me a postcard couple
               weeks later. Some soldier beat her up
               bad. Last I heard from her.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Was that soldier her boyfriend?

     The old man lets out a hoot.

<b>                          CLEO SHORT
</b>               They were all her boyfriends! Not so ugly
               and wearing a uniform, can't go wrong
               there. Betty believed in quantity before
               quality.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               You calling your own daughter a tramp?

<b>                          CLEO SHORT
</b>               Got five daughters. One bad apple ain't
               so bad.

     Lee's about to burst. Bucky motions for him to take a walk.
     Lee goes through the den into the bathroom. From his view
     Bucky can see Lee chase a couple pills with a glass of
     water...

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Any names, Mr. Short?

<b>                          CLEO SHORT
</b>               Tom, Dick, Harry. Don't matter.
                   (he drifts for a moment)
               Said she was looking for movie work
               but...just paraded the Boulevard in those
               black get-ups of hers.

     Lee returns to the room.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               I'm staking Nash's pad for the night. See
               if we get any strange drive-bys at the
               murder sight. Do me a favor and drop in
               on Kay. She's worried about me.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               She's a smart woman.

<b>     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky opens the front door to find Kay reading a book on the
     couch. She doesn't even look up.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Hi, Dwight.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Lee stomps, you tread lightly.

               probably on Benzedrine again--working
               that poor girl's murder--

                   (beat)
               But who's worried about you? Is that left
               for me?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               No need for that.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               For such a cautious man you're quite a
               hardcase.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               It's just...He's done a lot for me.

     Kay smiles, sweeps her arms around the perfect living room as
     if to reinforce to Bucky all Lee's done for her.

     The point is not lost on him.

     She crosses to him and kisses him softly on the cheek.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Good night.

<b>     INT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky sits at their kitchen table, eating a ham sandwich with
     a glass of milk and filling out the police reports.

<b>     INT. THE HOMICIDE BULLPEN - MORNING
</b>
     Bucky walks in reading the Herald front page: A picture of
     Elizabeth Short in a striking black dress. Underneath:"The
     Black Dahlia".

     He stops at a room where two detectives are sorting through
     a steamer trunk full of letters and assorted personal effects.

     his piece of paper. He stops at "S. Saddon".

<b>     INT. THE HALLWAY UPSTAIRS - LATER

     Bucky knocks on the door.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          SHERYL

     Two men lounge on the stoop. Koenig gives them the eye as he

     Bucky checks his piece of paper against the doorbells again.
     Finds "M. Graham" but no Linda Martin.

<b>                          KOENIG

<b>     INT. A COMMUNAL SITTING ROOM - LATER

     Marjorie Graham sits on a couch with a dog-eared back issue
     of Photoplay in her hands. She's mild but well-traveled.

<b>                          MARJORIE
</b>               ...Betty had this gift, you see. She was
               so sweet and eager to please...a bit
               dumb, maybe. But she'd do anything to be
               liked, become whatever you wanted her to
               be. She'd walk like you, or talk like
               you...but she wasn't...she was still her.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Did she ever tell you she was in a movie?
               Sometime around November?

<b>                          MARJORIE
</b>               Sure. She had this viewfinder and showed
               it around to all the guys. Said it was
               from the director. A co-starring role.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Did she say what it was?

<b>                          MARJORIE
</b>               Once she said it was for Fox. Another
               time Paramount. I think she was just

</b>               Don and Harold--sitting outside. She
               dated both of 'em once or twice. Other
               than that...I just...didn't really pay
               attention to who she was with.

     Marjorie looks down, fidgeting.

</b>               What is it? You can tell me.

<b>                          MARJORIE
</b>               Well...Right before she moved out...l saw
               her and Linda...

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          MARJORIE
</b>               Yeah. Her and Linda Martin--talking to
               this older woman up on the Boulevard. She
               had a man's suit and short hair like a
               man...Only that one time...

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Are you saying the woman was a lesbian?

     Marjorie nods yes.

     Bucky's about to press her for more when Bill Koenig barges
     in, all sweaty.

<b>                          KOENIG

               zipped cuz it don't look as good.

     Bucky looks at Marjorie. Back to Koenig.

</b>               Take their statements, Bill. I've got a
               little more here.

     Bill disappears back to the porch.

               Linda Martin's room?

<b>     INT. LINDA MARTIN'S ROOM - LATER

     Bucky pushes open the room and finds it empty. He checks the
     closet. Empty.

     Bucky runs his hand under the bed. Finds something and pulls
     it out. A small red vinyl purse. He opens the purse. Inside
     is an ID. He shows it to Marjorie.

<b>                          MARJORIE
</b>               This morning. I told her I'd called the
               police to come talk to us about Betty.
               Was that the wrong thing to do?

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>     EXT. THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - LATER
</b>
     Bucky emerges. Koenig stands on the stoop with the two men,
     both of whom look like they might have seen the wrong end of
     Koenig's less-than-subtle interrogation style.

<b>                          KOENIG
</b>                   (re the men)
               They didn't do it.

<b>     INT. AN ANONYMOUS CASTING OFFICE - DAY

     Clapsticks come down in front of the camera: "Elizabeth
     Short...Screen Test #1."

     Elizabeth Short sits on a tiny chair in a cheap office. She's
     dressed for an audition, overly made up and nervous.

<b>                          MAN (O.S.)

               To be honest, I'd pretty much overdosed
               on Betty Short's low-rent last months on

<b>     EXT. 39TH AND NORTON - DUSK - LATER

     Bucky cruises by the crime scene. Rubberneckers gawk around
     the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap
     portrait glossies of the Dahlia in a black dress.

<b>     INT. CENTRAL DIVISION BULLPEN - BUCKY'S DESK - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky sits at his desk staring at RAYMOND NASH'S MUGSHOT.

<b>     HIS EYES DRIFT TO:
</b>
     A WAGER POOL SIGN-UP LIST POSTED ON THE WALL: a crude felt
     craps table with various betting spaces: "Solved--2 to 1",
     "Random Sex Job--4 to 1", "Uhsolved--Even Money",
     "Boyfriend(s)--l to 4"...

     Next to it are TWO HALVES OF A BLACK DRESS on separate
     hangers...a crude joke.

     Bucky opens up his desk drawer and drops the Nash mugshot
     inside. He dials the phone:

     A dimly lit LESBIAN BAR. Butch women in GI khakis mix with
     soft girls in cashmere skirt suits.

     Bucky approaches a bartender. The woman sizes him up and
     slides him a whiskey.

<b>                          BARTENDER

     This time an Olde English motif. Bucky sips another free
     whiskey as a dozen more women pass the photos around. Bucky
     watches their reactions closely but doesn't see anything out
     of the ordinary.

     He takes another shot of whiskey and heads out the door.

     A bit buzzed and embarrassed to have to go booth to booth and
     break up couples, Bucky slowly makes his way around the bar
     with the two photos. More of the same...

     He approaches a woman polishing glasses at the bar. Slides
     over the photos.

     The bartender picks up the card and squints at it. Bucky sees
     a flicker of recognition in her eyes. She hesitates--

<b>                          BARTENDER

     He leans over the counter.

</b>               Don't you fuckin' lie to me. She's

               servin' raisinjack to bulldykes in

               though. She liked boys, I'm sure. And not
               the Dahlia. Never.

     Out of his peripheral vision Bucky sees another woman just
     starting to sit down on a bar stool but at the last minute,
     change her mind and make for the door.

     A baby spotlight catches her face; a fleeting resemblance to 
     Elizabeth Short.

     Bucky takes a deep breath, counts to ten and then goes out
     after the woman.

     figure in a sharkskin suit. He watches her walk up the
     enormous lawn and into the home.

     when the tune is interrupted by a feverish voice:

<b>                          ANNOUNCER
</b>               We interrupt our regular broadcast to
               bring you a bulletin. A major suspect in
               the investigation of Elizabeth Short, the
               raven-haired beauty known as the Black
               Dahlia, has been captured! Red Manley, a
               Huntington Park hardware salesman and one
               of the last men to be seen with the
               Dahlia, was captured early this morning.
               Currently being held at Hollenback
               Station--

     Bucky takes a quick left down another street.

     Bucky runs into Lee as he enters the station.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Dahlia left San Diego six days before we
               found her. Dago cops got a witness puts
               her in a tan Dodge with a partial plate
               ident. Finally got a cross-check that
               matched on Red here.

<b>     INT. OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - CONT.
</b>
     Seems like every cop in town has jammed themselves into a
     small corridor, watching Russ Millard interrogate RED MANLEY
     through a one way mirror. Manley is carrot-topped, 25, and
     scared shitless.

     Millard's soothing voice can be heard through speakers.

<b>                          MILLARD
</b>               Like I said, Robert. We're doing this
               because you didn't come forward.

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               I've told it three times now. I didn't
               want my wife to know I was chipping her.

<b>                          MILLARD
</b>               But you said you didn't chip on her.
               Betty wouldn't put out. That's no reason
               to hide from the police.

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               I dated her down in Dago. I slow-danced
               with her. It's the same thing as
               chipping.

<b>                          MILLARD
</b>               And you wanted to fuck her, didn't you?

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               I wanted...to test my loyalty to my wife.

<b>                          MILLARD
</b>               Come on, son!

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               I wanted to fuck her. Yes.

<b>                          MILLARD
</b>               But she cock-teased you.

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               She said she had her period--

     All of the cops outside laugh.

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               Said the father of her child would be a
               combat veteran--

<b>                          MILLARD
</b>               And you were in the Army band. You get
               angry?

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               I told you. I didn't kill her.

<b>                          MILLARD
</b>               You drove her back to LA with you
               on...December tenth? And dropped her at
               the Biltmore Hotel?

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               I've told it how many ways? How many more
               ways do you went to hear it?

     Millard straightens up and turns to the one-way mirror. He
     tugs at the knot of his tie. Soon after he slips out of the
     room and Harry Sears slips in.

     Bucky turns to Lee.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Welcome back to earth, partner.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Your fault, really. After you left Kay
               slipped me a Mickey. Slept for seventeen
               hours.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Your fault for buying her all those
               chemistry classes.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Learn anything interesting?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               No.

<b>                          LEE
</b>                   (re the interrogation)
               Now you'll see why Russ keeps Harry
               around.

<b>     INT. THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME
</b>
     Harry circles Red Manley, lightly tapping a metal-studded sap
     in his hand.

<b>                          LEE
</b>                   (re the sap)
               Russ's only rule. No actual hitting.

<b>     BACK INSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME
</b>
     Harry leans close to Red, tapping the sap on the table. His
     stutter completely gone.

<b>                          HARRY SEARS
</b>               You wanted some fresh gash, and you
               thought Betty was easy. You came on
               strong and that didn't work. You offered
               her money. She told you she was on the
               rag, and that was the final straw. You
               wanted to make her bleed for real--

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               No no no. Not Betty--

     Harry SMASHES the sap onto a glass ashtray, shattering it.
     Red bites down on his lip, cutting it.

<b>                          HARRY SEARS
</b>               You plied Betty with drinks, got her to
               talk about her old boyfriends and came on
               like a pal, like the nice little corporal
               willing to leave Betty to the real men,
               the men who saw combat--

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               No--

     Harry SMASHES the table again.

<b>                          HARRY SEARS
</b>               You took her to a toolshed, maybe one of
               those abandoned warehouses out by the old
               Ford plant in Pico-Rivera. There was some
               twine and lots of cutting tools lying
               around, and you got a hard-on...

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               No no no--

     Again Harry smashes the table. Red almost topples his chair
     backwards out of fear, only Harry's hand an the back slats
     keeping it from going over...

<b>                          HARRY SEARS
</b>               Yes, Reddy, yes. You thought of every
               girl who said "I don't suck", every time
               your mommy spanked you, every evil eye
               you got from real soldiers when you
               played your trombone in the army band.

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               No--

                          HARRY SEARS (cont'd)
               Goldbrick, needle-nick, pussy-whipped--

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               No--

<b>                          HARRY SEARS
</b>               That's what Betty had to pay for wasn't
               it?

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               No, please! God as my witness!

<b>                          HARRY SEARS
</b>               God hates liars!

     Smash!

                          HARRY SEARS (cont'd)
               Tell me, Red! Tell Betty! Tell God!

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               I didn't hurt her--

<b>                          HARRY SEARS
</b>               Tell God!

     Harry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls
     the whole thing over onto its side.

     Red fumbles out of the chair onto his knees. He clasps his
     hands together--

<b>                          RED MANLEY
</b>               The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
               want...

     He begins to weep. Completely broken.

     Harry turns to the one way mirror, looking straight out at
     his audience: self-loathing etched into his flabby,
     juicehound face.

     He gives the thumbs-down sign and walks out of the room.

<b>     OUTSIDE IN THE HALLWAY
</b>
     Russ Millard meets him at the door and leads him away from
     the general crowd of officers.

<b>     BACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM
</b>
     Bucky watches as Lee and another officer handcuff Red and
     take him outside. Lee has his hand on Red's shoulder like a
     kindly uncle.

<b>     OUTSIDE THE STATION
</b>
     Bucky stands on the steps, taking fresh air. Russ steps out.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Good report yesterday, Bleichert.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You send me back to Warrants?

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Wrong again. But keep going.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red
               dropped her off there on the tenth maybe
               we can start reconstructing the last days
               before she got snatched.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Bright penny. You're doing well, Bucky.
               Run with the ball.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               All I know is you should keep an eye on
               Loew and his boys.
               I didn't put it in my report, but Betty
               sold it outright when she needed money
               bad enough, and Loew's been trying to
               keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if
               he ever takes it to trial.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD

               You calling your boss an evidence

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          MILLARD
</b>               Keep an eye on the evidence suppressor

               sure they don't try to coerce a
               confession out of that innocent man in
               the holding tank.

     He pats Bucky on the shoulder and walks inside.

               believed to be a glamorous siren headed
               for Hollywood stardom...

     Bucky cruises in his car into Lee and Kay's neighborhood.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               It was as if they would have traded their
               own lives for a juicy front-page death.

               words: "All bullshit".

<b>     IN FRONT OF LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Bucky pulls up just as Kay storms out the door and down the
     steps, hurling an armful of paper onto the lawn. Lee storms
     beside her, shouting and waving his arms as they go back
     inside.

     Bucky walks over and kneels down besides the papers: carbons
     of LAPD report forms, tip sheets, evidence tickets, the
     autopsy...all with "E. Short" typed at the top.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Oh Jesus.

     Kay and Lee come back out again, Kay tossing out more files.

               three misdemeanors here. It's out of

                   (to Kay)

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes.

     She turns on them both and goes back inside. Before Lee can
     make a wisecrack Bucky kicks his way through the LAPD papers
     back to his car...

<b>     INT. LAVERNE'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky sits low in his car, watching THE WHITE PACKARD parked
     near the front of LaVerne's. He's been there awhile...

     Finally the woman from the night before exits and heads for
     her car. He jumps out and walks quickly to intercept her
     while she's fumbling for her keys.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Slumming, Miss Sprague?

     She sighs, exasperated.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               I am now. Daddy spying on me again?

     She pulls a wad of cash out of her purse. Switching to a very
     deft imitation of a Scotchman's burr:

                          MADELEINE (cont'd)
               Maddy, girl, ye shouldn't be congregatin'
               in such unsuitable places--

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Well that's a new one--

     She peels off another bill. Hands it to Bucky. He counts it
     out. Over a hundred dollars.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Homicide.

     He hands the money back.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Let's try Elizabeth Short. Linda Martin.

     All of her bravado drops. Bucky sees it immediately. He grabs
     her purse and keys and tosses them on the hood of her car.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Here or downtown? I know you knew her so
               don't jerk me off on that or it's
               downtown and a whole lot of publicity.

     She opens the door to her car and slides in. Bucky gets in
     next to her. By the roof light he can see that her similarity
     to the Dahlia is more in her clothes and hair, but the
     resemblance is still there nonetheless.

               Betty maybe one time. Linda a couple.
               She'd come in to cadge a drink or a meal
               off a sister.

<b>                          BUCKY

     Lee listens to the call, not saying anything. It goes on for

     Both Martha and Ramona stand up. Martha is 19, plain and
     serious, with a tenacious resemblance to Emmett. (Neither of
     whom look much like Madeleine.)

     Ramona, on the other hand, possesses a pushing-fifty
     resemblance to Madeleine combined with the flaccid face and
     unfocused features of a booze or drug addict.

</b>               A great people, the Germans. Hitler was a

</b>               An old friend stuffed him. We were in the
               Scots regiment together. Georgie Tilden.
               He wanted to work in the flickers.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               So when did you come here?

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               1920. Hollywood was a cow pasture, but
               the silent flickers was booming. Georgie
               got work as a lighting man, and me
               building houses.
               Georgie got me introduced to Mack Sennett
               and I helped him build that housing
               project he was putting up--Hollywoodland--
               underneath that godawful sign.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I always loved the Keystone Kops.

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               Old Mack knew how to squeeze a dollar
               dry, he did. He had extras moonlighting
               as laborers and vice versa. I used to
               drive 'em over to Hollywoodland after
               twelve hours on a Keystone Cops flicker
               and put in another six hours by
               torchlight. Even gave me as assistant
               director credit a couple times, so
               grateful he was for the way I squeezed
               his slaves--

     A SCREECH interrupts Emmett's monologue. Bucky looks across
     the table to see Ramona trying to corral a potato with her
     fork (the source of the sound).

                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (cont'd)
               Mother? Are you feeling well? Would you
               like to contribute to the conversation?

     Ramona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily.

<b>                          RAMONA
</b>               Did you know, Mr. Bleichert, that Ramona
               Boulevard was named after me?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               No Mrs. Sprague, I didn't.

<b>                          RAMONA
</b>               When Emmett married me for my father's
               money he promised my family that he would
               use his influence with the City Zoning
               Board to have a street named after me.
               But all he could manage was a dead-end
               block in a red light district in Lincoln
               Heights. Are you familiar with the
               neighborhood, Mr. Bleichert?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I grew up there.

<b>                          RAMONA
</b>               Then you know that the Mexican
               prostitutes expose themselves out of
               windows to attract customers. I hear many
               of them know Mr. Sprague by name--

     Emmett Sprague SLAMS the table. Plates rattle. Silence. Bucky
     stares into his lap as Madeleine grabs his knee tightly.

               I'll sing for my supper when Mayor Bowron
               comes to dinner, but not for Madeleine's
               male whores. A common policeman. My God,
               Emmett. How little you think of me.

     She struggles to her feet and leaves the room. Her husband
     follows.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               How?

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               He bought rotten lumber and abandoned
               movie facades from Mack Sennett and built
               houses out of them. He's got firetraps
               all over LA registered to phony
               corporations...His "good friend" George?
               Disfigured in a car crash while running
               Daddy some errands. Daddy throws him
               scraps now--odd jobs tending some rental
               property--

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You don't have to tell me this--

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               I want to. I like you Bucky.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I like you, too.

     She looks at him earnestly.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Bucky, I didn't tell you all about Betty
               Short.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Jesus--

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Don't be mad at me. It's nothing. I just
               don't want to lie to you.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               What is it?

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Last summer I was bar-hopping a lot.
               Straight bars. I heard about a girl who
               looked like me. I got curious and left
               notes at a couple places: "Your lookalike
               wants to meet you", things like that. I
               left my number. She called. That's how I
               met her at LaVerne's with Linda.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               And that's all of it?

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Yes. That's all of it.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Then be prepared, babe. There's fifty
               cops out there combing every bar in town
               looking for Dahlia info. You could be
               headed for the papers no matter what.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Serve my family right.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You don't mean that.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               No. I don't.

     He strokes her dark hair.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Tell me something. Why'd you want to meet
               Betty Short?

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               I've worked pretty hard to be loose and
               free. But the way people described Betty.
               It sounded like she was a natural.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               How do you mean?

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Hmmm...She was this poor girl...Came from
               nothing...But then she carried nothing
               with her, either. I don't know...when
               you're rich sometimes you romanticize the
               poor...

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I wouldn't know.

     An awkward silence as she considers her foot in her mouth. He
     studies her for a moment. Pulls her close, kisses her
     mouth...the arch of her neck...They begin to move together
     again...

     Another LAPD FORM: "Witness Report: Lorna
     Martikova...aka Linda Martin..."

<b>     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - MOVING
</b>
     Bucky weaves fast through traffic. He whips a right turn...

<b>     EXT. THE CALEDONIA LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Bucky's car screeches into the parking lot just as LINDA
     MARTIN bursts through the doors and takes off running.

     Bucky jumps from the car and sprints after her, the girl
     clutching an oversized purse to her chest as she dashes in
     and out of busy traffic.

     The girl runs like a fucking antelope as Bucky barely misses
     being hit by a large BEER TRUCK and gets to the other side of
     the street just as Linda stumbles over a curb--sending her
     sprawling on the sidewalk.

     Bucky jumps on her, grabbing her tiny fists as she kicks and
     screams like a hell cat.

     He cuffs her and pulls her up, dragging her to where she
     spilled her purse.

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>               I'm an emancipated minor and if you touch
               me without a matron present I'll sue you!

     He picks it up her purse. Surprised by the heft, he opens it
     and pulls out A METAL FILM CAN.

     Her demeanor changes instantly to fear:

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>                   (near tears)
               Please, mister...My...my parents.

<b>     INT. JUVENILE DETENTION HALL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
</b>
     Russ, Harry and Bucky sit opposite Linda Martin. She's pretty
     and small, and about to get smaller...

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               ...and you don't recall any of the names

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>               They were just pickups.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               No one who would do her harm?

     The girl thinks hard, shakes her head "no".

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You made the casting rounds together.
               Ever get any movie work?

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>               No.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               So what about the film can?

     Her eyes go to the floor, tears begin to drop.

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>               It's...a movie.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               A dirty movie?

     She nods her head silently.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               You have to tell us the whole thing,
               sweetheart. So think it through.

     Harry pours her a paper cup of water. She takes a sip.

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>               I was...cadging at a bar in Gardena. This
               Mexican man - Raoul or Jorge or something
               - starting talking to me.
               I thought I was pregnant, and I was
               desperate wicked bad for money. He said
               he'd give me two hundred dollars to act
               in a nudie film.

     She takes a large gulp of water.

                          LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)
               He said he needed another girl so I asked
               Betty. The three of us drove down to
               Tijuana and we made the movie at this big
               house outside of town. (beat) Then he
               drove us back to LA.

     Her head bowed. Russ and Harry stare at her impassively.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Was this around Thanksgiving?

     She nods yes.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did the Mex give Betty a viewfinder?

     She raises her head in recognition and nods yes.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did he seem particularly interested in
               Betty? Did she see him again?

     She shakes her head "no".

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               But you saw him again, didn't you? How
               else could you have gotten a copy?

     Linda looks sadly at Bucky.

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>               After Betty...After I read about
               Betty...I went looking for him in
               Gardena. He was about to go back to
               Mexico and I conned him out of a print.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Where was that?

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>               I don't remember. On Aviation somewhere.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Why would you do that?

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>               A Black Dahlia stag film? I thought...I
               could sell it if I had to. (ashamed) It
               was...a collector's item.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               And he willingly gave you a copy of the
               film? For nothing?

<b>                          LINDA MARTIN
</b>               No. Not for nothing.

     She looks down again. The cops look at each other. Linda's
     harder and more desperate than they imagined.

                          LINDA MARTIN (cont'd)
               You'll let me have it back, won't you?
               You won't let people look at it?

     Now its the cops turn to look away.

<b>     EXT. THE HALLWAY - AFTER
</b>
     Russ and Bucky.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Whattya think?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I think she's covering on the Mex angle.
               Maybe she knows him and doesn't want him
               taking a smut rap. Maybe he's white. The
               TJ stuff is sound, though. I'd detach Meg
               Caulfield from Wilshire Clerical to play
               cellmate for a day.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Bleichert you are a very bright penny
               today. (beat) Well. Looks like it's blue
               movie night at City Hall.

<b>     INT. THE MUSTER ROOM - LATER
</b>
     A projector and screen has been set up. All the big-wigs are
     present: Ellis Loew, Jack Tierney, Thad Green and Chief of
     Police C.B. Horrall. Millard, Harry and Lee.

     A clerical assistant threads the projector as Bucky settles
     into a seat next to Lee. On Lee's lap is a newspaper with the 
     headline: "Boulevard-Citizen's Mastermind to be Released
     --LA Bound after 8 years of Custody"

<b>                          LEE
</b>                   (raggedy)
               Gettin' any?

     Bucky's about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred
     image hits the screen. It begins to focus.

     A title: "Slave Girls From Hell"

     The movie: A big high-ceiling room with Egyptian
     hieroglyphics on the walls. Pillars shaped like coiled
     serpents are stationed throughout the room; the camera zooms
     in for a close-up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each
     other's tails. The snakes dissolve into Betty Short, wearing
     only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance...

     An audible breath in the muster room.

     A hand reaches into frame, passing Betty a large cylindrical
     object: a dildo, scales covering the shaft, fangs extending
     from the circumcised head. Betty puts it in her mouth, sucks
     it, eyes wide open and glassy.

     An abrupt cut: Linda Martin, naked, lying on a divan. Betty
     enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between Linda's
     legs, pushing it inside her. Linda rotates her hips, trying
     her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness.

     Another cut: Betty mouthing the words "No, please" to the
     camera. A hand pushing her head down towards Linda's crotch.
     Betty tonguing next to the dildo...

<b>     BACK ON THE MUSTER ROOM
</b>
     The atmosphere is somber, but calm. The film continues...

<b>                          CHIEF HORRALL
</b>               Whattya think, Russ? This got anything to
               do with the girl's murder--

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are headed
               down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn't play
               as the killer. But maybe he showed it to
               someone--

     Suddenly Lee jumps up, standing in front of the screen.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Who gives a fuck if he didn't kill her!
               I've sent Boy Scouts to the green room
               for less than this!

     He yanks down the screen with a crash and storms out of the
     room. The movie continues on the chalked up blackboard.

<b>     INT. THE LOCKER ROOM - LATER
</b>
     Lee sits on the ground, head in his hands. Bucky enters and
     sits on a bench next to him.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               Did you see her face, Bucky? Did you see?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Yeah. I did, partner. I did.

     Bucky notices Lee's still clutching the De Witt article in
     his fist. He pries it loose.

     Ellis Loew and Russ Millard enter.

<b>                          ELLIS LOEW

     Poison hangs in the air. Ellis turns on his heels.

     Bucky sits in his cubicle searching the Dahlia files. The

</b>               Sugar, Betty and I made love once, that
               one time we met last summer. I just did

               with someone who looked like me and--

</b>               Jesus Christ.

     He jumps from the bed and pulls on his pants.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Bucky that's it, I swear. Please stay--

     He pulls on his shirt, his handcuffs and his .38. Grabs his
     jacket--

               Stay sugar stay--

     --and slams the door on the way out.

<b>     INT. THE POLICE CRUISER - LATER
</b>
     Bucky steamed in the car. He flips on the police radio,
     looking for distraction. Instead he gets:

<b>                          RADIO DISPATCHER
</b>               Code four all units at Crenshaw and
               Stocker. Two dead, suspect dead, Raymond
               Douglas Nash, warrant number--

<b>     EXT. A KOREAN GROCERY - MINUTES LATER
</b>
     RAYMOND NASH lies dead on the sidewalk. Off to one side, a
     short and wiry cop is describing for detectives how it all
     went down, pantomiming how he shot an escaping Raymond Nash.

     Bucky stands over Nash, staring at his dead features. He
     walks inside.

<b>     INT. A KOREAN GROCERY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Bucky's POV:

     A robbery gone bad. A sixty-year old Korean shopowner lies
     dead behind the counter and his teenaged son lies dead in an
     aisle. Blood and green linoleum.

<b>     INT. THE SQUAD ROOM - SOON AFTER

     Bucky bursts into the squad room, seeing red.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Blanchard!

     A cop walking through the bullpen points to the bathroom.

<b>     INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Bucky kicks in the door, finding Lee washing his hands in the
     sink. He holds his hands up to Bucky, blood oozes from Lee's
     knuckles.

<b>                          LEE
</b>               I beat up a wall. Penance for Nash.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Not good enough.

     Bucky steps into Lee with fists flying, a mad demon. He
     smashes him again and again, beating his only friend until
     Lee slides senseless to the floor...

<b>     INT. BUCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky drinks bourbon straight, his wrist heavily bandaged.

               wrist, two dislocated knuckles and the

               isn't everything got that part right.

<b>     EXT. LEE AND KAY'S HOUSE - NEXT DAY

     Bucky walks into the house and finds Kay there. She holds up
     a newspaper: The front page includes The Black Dahlia, Junior
     Nash, and Bobby De Witt.

<b>                          KAY

     Bucky looks ashamed.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               I don't blame you.

     He walks to her and she holds him.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               He's in trouble, you know.

     She nods. He strokes her hair.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               De Witt's probably in LA by now. If Lee
               doesn't show up by tonight I'll come over
               to stay with you.

               sleep an the couch again.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Kay. Lee--

     She holds up a hand, waving him off. She knows all this.

</b>               You know Dwight? Fighting, cops, guns. To
               most people--that's the scary stuff. Not
               everything else.

     She knows him to the core. She steps back, holding his hands.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Luck.

<b>                          BUCKY

     He rings off looking very disturbed as Russ and Harry arrive.

     Bucky exhales hard.

               That was County Parole. Bobby DeWitt
               bought a bus ticket at the Santa Rosa
               depot this morning. San Diego. Transfer
               Tijuana.

<b>     EXT. TIJUANA - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAWN
</b>
     Bucky cruises the Tijuana streets: child beggars dig for 
     breakfast in trash cans, taco venders stir pots of dog-meat
     stew, sailors and marines stumble out of whorehouses. Rurales
     drive prewar Chevys wearing black uniforms...

               "Mex" was actually a local named Walter
               Wellington, who copped to making the film
               but quickly provided the cops his alibi
               for the Dahlia's missing days.

     Bucky parks at a big pink Art Deco hotel (The Divisidero).

<b>     INT. THE DIVISIDERO - CONTINUOUS

     Bucky badges the desk clerk and gets a room number. He heads
     upstairs.

               becoming a farce.

     Ellis Loew, Fritz Vogel, and Bill Koenig arguing.

<b>                          ELLIS LOEW
</b>               We can't do that! Wellington told Tierney
               he made the pic--

     Bucky opens the door and the room falls quiet.

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               Bleichert.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          ELLIS LOEW
</b>               Fuck Blanchard. He's suspended.

     Bucky charges the DA but Vogel and Koenig intercept him,
     pushing him roughly back out in the hall. Loew retreats to
     the other side of the room.

<b>                          VOGEL

               I'll drive. You look like shit.

<b>     EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS
</b>
     Bucky and Fritz Vogel drive past beggars swarming tourists,
     hookers dispensing front seat blow jobs, zoot suit youths
     prowling for drunks to roll...

<b>     EXT. THE TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS
</b>
     The two men park the car in the middle of a car-choked street
     and decide to try walking. They're immediately swallowed up
     by kid beggars shoving crucifixes in their faces.

     Bucky tosses handfuls of coins into the gutters and the
     children scatter, squabbling over the coins.

<b>     IN THE BACKGROUND
</b>
     Fritz Vogel approaches a Rurale and talks to him. The Rurale
     nods yes, gesturing down an alley to a squat cinderblock
     building.

     cops walk in to face

<b>     BOBBY DEWITT

     the hatchet-faced tough of 1939 now a grizzled and bloated
     well-used piece of work. He stands up, full of con bravado.

     Vogel kicks in the balls, dropping him to his knees. Vogel
     smashes him with a thick backhand across the face.

     DeWitt's head bobs up and down.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Now Blanchard's scared of you. Why?

               know is what I read in the papers. Maybe
               I was thinkin' revenge, maybe talkin'
               trash to my cellies, but when Lee beauty
               killed them niggers--

     Vogel topples DeWitt with a right hook and then picks him
     back up by the neck, squeezing the life out of him.

     Bucky turns back to De Witt, who's much more relaxed now that
     Vogel's left the cell.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>     IN SLOW MOTION--

     Bucky leaps on De Witt, grabbing him around the neck and
     choking him. De Witt turns blue, his eyes bulging out--

     and then hands on his shoulders as Ducky is hurled backwards
     into the cell bars. And then

     which slowly becomes grey, and then back to normal as Bucky
     finds himself awakening on the floor of the cell.

     Refocusing on the scene:

     Two Rurales in jodhpur boots pick their teeth with
     matchsticks as Fritz Vogel pulls Bucky to his feet.

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               Boyo! Glad you could make it.

     He claps Bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house.

<b>     INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     The interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels,
     which is exactly what Vogel, Bucky and Ellis Loew are
     consuming. Bucky drinks with the trepidation of the King's
     food taster.

<b>                          ELLIS LOEW
</b>               I called this little meeting for a couple
               reasons, Bucky.
               We'd both like to see the Short case
               closed out and get back to normal
               business.

     Bucky looks impatient and Ellis senses this.

                          ELLIS LOEW (cont'd)
               We're both comers, Bucky. Fritzie wants
               you for his partner when he gets his
               lieutenancy, and--

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires.

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               You're too raw for him, boyo. Old Russ is
               a sob sister, and I'm much more your type.

     Bucky considers the truth in this. To Loew:

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               What do you want, Ellis?

<b>                          ELLIS LOEW
</b>               Very well, Dwight. I'll tell you. There
               are four confessors still being held at
               City Jail. They've got no alibis, weren't
               coherent when they were first questioned,
               and they're all violent, frothing-at-the-
               mouth lunatics. I want them reintegrated.
               It's a muscle job.

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               I wanted Bill Koenig--

<b>                          ELLIS LOEW
</b>               But Bill's a bit too enamored with
               violence. So it's you, Dwight. Yes or no?
               Because if it's yes, I'll make sure
               you're back on Warrants tomorrow with an
               inside track to some stripes. If not,
               it's Homicide shitwork until Russ Millard
               gets tired of you. We both know that Russ
               is a patient, forbearing man, Dwight.
               That could be a long time. Yes or no?

     A huge sawdust-covered roam, meathooks dangling from the
     ceiling. Beef dangles over half the hooks. The four men look 
     terrified.

     The camera finds the third man, CHARLIE ISSLER:

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               Charlie Issler was a pimp and a career
               confessor specializing in copping to

               beefs had netted him a year county jail
               time, his phony confessions two ninety
               day observation stints at the Camarillo
               nut farm.

     And the fourth man, PAUL ORCHARD:

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               And finally Paul Orchard. Jack roller,
               male prostitute, and a former San
               Bernardino County deputy sheriff.

     The group reaches a back wall of the warehouse where FOUR
<b>     UNUSED MEATHOOKS DANGLE OVER FOUR CHAIRS.
</b>
     Bucky studies the men's apprehensive faces as Vogel stands
     each one on a chair with their manacled hands hooked over
     their respective meathooks.

     Bucky's gaze drifts back behind a large box where he sees A
     SHEET-COVERED TABLE sticking out. Before his curiosity draws
     him over Vogel addresses the prisoners.

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               You all confessed to killing the Dahlia.
               We can't prove you did, so you're gonna
               have to convince us... Query on, Bucko.

     Bucky takes a deep breath and heads first to old man Bidwell.
     The man's palsy has him shaking and Bucky grabs the meathook
     above him to steady him.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why'd
               you kill her?

     Bidwell looks at him with beseeching eyes.

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               Don't be timid, boyo. That bird made
               little boys suck his hog.

     Bucky's hand twitches on the meathook.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Come clean, pop.

<b>                          BIDWELL
</b>               I didn't kill her mister. I just wanted a
               ticket to the honor farm. Three hots and
               a cot, that's all. Please, mister.

     The man's weakened state makes his argument for him. Bucky
     moves on to Cecil Durkin.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Tell me about it, Cecil.

               You get that line from Dick Tracy or
               Gangbusters?

     Bucky catches Vogel out of the corner of his eye. Measuring...

<b>                          BUCKY

</b>               I fucked Betty Short and I fucked your
               mama! I'm your fucking daddy!

     Bucky one-two's him in the solar plexus. His legs buckle, but
     he keeps his feet on the chair.

                          DURKIN (cont'd)
               You think you clever, don't you. You the
               bad guy, your buddy the nice guy. Older
               than vaudeville.

</b>               I'm the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in

     This shuts Durkin up. Bucky moves to Charlie Issler.

<b>                          ISSLER
</b>                   (sincere)
               Please. I didn't kill Liz. I don't know
               why I do these things, and I apologize.
               So please don't let that man hurt me.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          ISSLER

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You're a pimp. You know Betty Short?

<b>                          ISSLER

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Why'd you confess to her murder?

<b>                          ISSLER
</b>               She looked so...sweet and pretty and I
               felt so bad. I always confess to the
               pretty ones.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          ISSLER
</b>               I do such nasty things I don't know why--

     Vogel struts over, putting on brass knuckles.

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               This kid glove routine's gettin' old--

     He kicks Issler's chair out from under him, the pimp
     screaming as his wrists snap. Vogel kicks the remaining three
     chairs out, punctuating each with a declaration:

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Jack roller! Nigger! Baby fucker!

     The men scream like dying animals as Fritzie zeroes in on
     Charlie Issler. He begins punching him in the gut with the
     brass knuckles.

                          VOGEL (cont'd)
               Tell me about the Dahlia's missing days
               you whoremonger! Tell me!

<b>                          ISSLER

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               Tell me what you know!

     He punches him in the crotch.

<b>                          ISSLER
</b>               I knew you at Ad Vice!

     Vogel ignores him, rabbit punching him, cracking one rib and
     then another--

<b>     ON BUCKY'S FACE
</b>
     knowing this is getting out of control. He's mesmerized by A
     FIRE ALARM on the wall behind the men...

<b>                          VOGEL
</b>               Tell me what your girls tell you!

     Issler retches, coughing up blood. Bucky stares at the fire
     alarm as Fritz runs through his field of vision, cackling.

     Bucky refocuses on the scene as Fritzie returns, wheeling the
     sheet-covered table Bucky'd seen before. He whips off the
     sheet revealing:

<b>     A NAKED FEMALE CORPSE, CUT IN TWO AND MADE UP TO LOOK LIKE
</b><b>     THE DAHLIA.

     Vogel grabs Issler by the scruff of the neck and jerks him
     down off of the meathook.

               ticket!

     Issler bites through his lip as Fritzie pulls out a
     switchblade and pops it open.

     Bucky takes in the nightmare scene all in slow-motion, the
     men with their broken wrists, the pudgy naked corpse, Fritzie
     with the knife...

     He runs for the fire alarm and pulls the lever, a piercing
     bell ringing out as Bucky runs out of the warehouse and jumps
     into the drunk wagon, tearing off into the night.

<b>     INT. KAY AND LEE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Kay answers the door and finds Bucky sitting on the front
     porch, sobbing.

     She moves to him, touching him on the back of the neck, the
     stroke of her finger enough to make him stand and face her.

<b>     INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
     Bucky tries to talk but she puts fingers to his mouth. Mouth
     to his fingers. She undresses him. Slowly she touches him,
     easing him, bringing him back to earth, back to humanity. To
     her.

     And finally they are joined.

<b>     DOWN THE STREET
</b>
     two officers brutally herd winos into a drunk wagon. Bucky
     turns and walks the other direction, refusing to help. They
     see him and sneer.

               determined to spend my shifts trying to

     Bucky watches Fritz Vogel beats the hell out of Charles

     Short stands and screams:

     Bucky gets to his feet.

     Bucky stakes out the dark house.

     Bucky slips an oil dipstick into the narrow crack of the back
     door and flips the simple hook and eyehole lock. He slides
     into the house...

<b>     INT. FRITZ VOGEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     as Bucky creeps through the house until he gets to a closed
     door. He opens it, entering

<b>     FRITZIE'S STUDY
</b>
     He stumbles along the wall until he finds a standing
     gooseneck lamp and turns it on. The walls are covered with
     pictures of Fritzie in uniform, dating back twenty-five
     years.

     Bucky bends down in front of the small mahogany desk and
     begins rifling through its file drawers. What he finds
     surprises him:

     --carbons of official LAPD intelligence reports, lists of
     account balances, financial dealings, payments made--all 
     cross-referenced to each individual being investigated.

     A veritable how-to primer on how to extort from criminals..

     Bucky digs deeper into the files and pulls out:

     ISSLER'S AD VICE FILE complete with mug shots.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Hello, Charlie. Get lost?

     Bucky scans the file, running his finger down the list of
     names, looking for something familiar. He stops at one:
     "SALLY STINSON". Beside her name a handwritten note:
     "Biltmore Hotel".

     He writes it down and moves to another list of names: "Known 
     Associates, no Prostitution Record".

     And there it is: "Betty Short".

     walks outside and crosses into

     Crammed with blues awaiting roll call. They all stare at
     Bucky; he meets the eyes that seek his, making them look
     down. Defiant.

     As he passes he can hear the hisses: "Traitor". "Bolshevik".
     He continues towards the door, almost out when suddenly he
     hears applause.

               buying off the cops with double-saws

     north has now becoming a roadside migration march. Every

     Bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown
     he's ever seen:

     Rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the
     northbound migration line, taking money and attaching tags to
     their shoulders with staple guns; plainclothes cops sell bags
     of beef jerky and dried fruit, putting coins into dispensers
     attached to their belts.

     Two Rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless
     with the butts of their sawed-off shotguns.

     Velvet wall hangings depicting Jesus decorate the entrance
     hall. Blackshirts lounge on converted pews, a huge carved

               February. Musta talked fights for ten
               hours straight. You know Blanchard thinks
               the feathers are the best division? me,
               it's the middies for sure. La Motta,
               Graziano--

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Is he still in town?

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>               Don't think so. I own this place. He
               ain't been back. You lookin' for a
               rematch?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I'm looking to get him out of a shitload
               of trouble.

     The old pug looks him up and down.

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>               Well. I'll tell ya the little I know.
               Heard he caused a ruckus over at the Club
               Satan, had to bribe his way out big with
               Captain Vasquez. Talk to Ernie the cook.
               Tell him I said to be kosher with you.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Thank you.

<b>                          OLD MAN
</b>               You ain't been in there.

<b>     INT. CLUB SATAN - LATER
</b>
     Bucky walks into the biggest sewer you have ever seen. The
     bar is a urinal trough where marines and sailors masturbate
     while going down on nude women squatting on the bartop. Blow
     jobs are being dispensed underneath tables facing the
     bandstand.

     Up on the stage a man in a Satan costume is fucking a woman
     on a mattress. Next to him, a donkey with red velvet horns
     pinned to his head eats hay out of a bowl while drunken
     servicemen shout "Donkey! Donkey!"

     Bucky is accosted by a disgusting old woman.

<b>                          OLD WOMAN
</b>               You wan' the bar, handsome? Breakfast of
               champions, one dollar. Round the world,
               two dollars.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Ernie. I need to see Ernie.

<b>                          OLD WOMAN
</b>               Vamanos!

     And grabs him by the arm...

<b>     INT. THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     ERNIE, a half-Mexican half-Chinese man, stands next to a huge
     vat of stew. Bucky flashes Lee's photo.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I heard this man gave you some trouble a
               while back.

<b>                          ERNIE
</b>               Who wants to know?

     Bucky flashes his badge, giving him a glimpse of his gun.

<b>                          ERNIE
</b>               You his friend?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               He's my best friend.

     The chef tucks his hands into his aprons, fidgeting.

<b>                          ERNIE
</b>               Your friend drink fourteen shots of my
               best Mescal, a house record. That I like.
               He make toasts to dead women. That I don't
               mind. But he try to fuck with my donkey
               show, and that I don't take.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               What happened?

<b>                          ERNIE
</b>               Four of my guys he take, the fifth he
               don't. Rurales take him home to sleep it
               off.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               That's it?

     Ernie casually pulls a switchblade out of his apron and
     scratches the back of his neck with it.

<b>                          ERNIE
</b>               Finito.

<b>     EXT. THE CLUB SATAN - LATER
</b>
     Bucky walks outside and begins weaving his way back through
     the crowds. Out of the corner of his eye he catches a couple
     Rurales who seem to have taken an interest in him.

     He dodges down an alley and cuts down another street,
     breaking into a slow jog.

<b>     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SECONDS LATER
</b>
     Bucky walks backwards, checking the crowd. He's lost them.

<b>     INT. THE FLEABAG MOTEL - LATER
</b>
     Bucky stands in front of his door. He runs his finger up and
     down the door jamb. The hairs are gone.

     With one swift kick he breaks down the door.

<b>     INT. THE MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER
</b>
     A white man stands with his hands raised.

<b>                          MAN
</b>               Whoa, Bleichert. I'm a friend--

     Bucky gestures with his gun for the man to hit the wall. He
     frisks him, pulling out a wallet and tossing on the bed.

                          MAN (cont'd)
               Milton Dolphine, citizen of San Diego and
               a licensed private dick. I got seventy
               bucks in there but that money's jackshit
               compared to what Blanchard was holding.
               You go partners with me and it's easy
               street--

     Bucky kicks the man's legs out and pushes his to the floor.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You tell me all of it and you watch what
               you say about my partner, or it's a B&E
               roust and the Ensenada jail.

     Dolphine pulls himself up.

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               You mean Vasquez? How do you think I knew
               to follow you? He's got a vested interest
               in you not finding out about Blanchard.

     Bucky eyes the door.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Does he know I'm staying here?

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               No.

     Bucky steps back from Dolphine.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               So. Let's hear it.

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               About a month ago this Mexican woman
               shows up at my office in Dago. Chubby,
               ten tons a makeup, but dressed to the
               nines. Offers me five hundred to find
               Blanchard. Just like you I track him here
               where he's playing the rich gringo--

<b>     A FLASHBACK - LEE TEARING UP AN ENSENADA BAR
</b>
<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               I even see him beat up two spics who
               insult this Senorita--Rurales stand by
               and do nothing. So I know he's paying
               protection dough. A lot of it. Then  I
               hear he paid off two plainclothes Rurale
               to snuff a coupla guys in TJ--

<b>     A FLASHBACK - BOBBY DE WITT AND FELIX CASCO BLOWN AWAY...
</b>
<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               I leave a message in Dago for the woman
               tellin' her what I know...

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               What's her name?

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               Delores Garcia. But it was obviously a
               phony. Casco ran with some rich bimbos
               and I'm betting she's one of his. Revenge
               on Blanchard for offin' Felix.

     Bucky tightens his grip on the slats of a wooden chair. This
     is hitting him hard.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Go on.

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               I come back to Ensenada on my own,
               thinking about all that cash he was
               flashing.

     Bucky's jaw clenches.

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               You wanna hear this?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Go on.

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               Blanchard's dead. Bullet in the cabeza.
               (beat) Rumor is they never found any
               money.

     Bucky's head begins to reel...

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               Maybe the Rurales. Maybe that woman or
               friends of hers. Who knows? I figured
               Blanchard was rogue, figured someone like
               you'd come lookin' for him. Maybe have a
               line on where the cash was. You knew
               Blanchard, maybe we can--

     Bucky backhands Dolphine hard, knocking him off the chair.

                          DOLPHINE (cont'd)
               Look I didn't know it was personal! Don't
               hit me again--

     Bucky has his gun out, leveled at Dolphine.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Prove it to me. Prove it!

<b>     EXT. THE BACKROADS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT
</b>
     Dolphine drives his car while Bucky trains his gun on him.

     They come over a ridge and find themselves on a big bluff
     overlooking the ocean. A HUGE WOODEN BURNING CROSS marks the
     spot.

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               The locals keep the damn thing lit up.
               They got a lotta missing relatives.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You got a shovel?

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               Gardening tools--

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Good enough.

<b>     EXT. THE BLUFF - LATER
</b>
     Bucky scavenges a spare piece of picket fence, wraps it in a
     rag and lights a torch off of the cross. Dolphine kicks at a
     filthy American flag in the sand.

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               Here. Supposed to be near el bannero.

<b>                                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>     A SMALL SHOVEL PUSHING INTO THE GROUND
</b>
     as Dolphine digs at gun point. After a few strokes the crunch
     of the shovel hitting bone.

     Bucky terrified to look but has to know--

     --a white jumper--

<b>                          DOLPHINE
</b>               Sailor's uniform. It's a sailor...

     Bucky breathes out hard. Unbearable. Dolphine digs on,
     pushing the corpse out of the way and digging further into he
     sand.

     Bucky can't stand the suspense. He tucks his gun into his
     waistband and grabs the shovel. After a few more strokes the
     thump of something solid.

     And suddenly it's there--sunburned pink skin, blond hair and
     stitch scars on the eyebrows.

     Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard. Lee Blanchard.

     And Bucky's in Dolphine's truck while Dolphine's screaming
     for him to wait and Bucky slams the truck in reverse,
     knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out
     of the sand onto the road, heading north and leaving Dolphine
     and Lee alone at the grave...Heading north like a refugee...

<b>     EXT. KAY'S HOUSE - DAWN
</b>
     Bucky's car rolls up slowly as he kills the engine, trying
     not to make any noise.

     The sun comes up, illuminating Bucky's filthy face as he
     watches the picture-perfect house, wishing time would stand
     still. Or better yet, wishing it would go back...

     Finally he gets out of the car and begins a long walk into
     the house.

<b>                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

</b>
     But as the camera PULLS BACK we see Bucky in his dress blues
     standing next to Kay in a wedding dress.

<b>     EXT. THE BACKYARD OF KAY'S HOUSE
</b>
     Russ Millard and Harry Sears stand by as the only two guests.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               Lee and Kay had lived in sin; not because
               their shack job was against department
               regs, but because the ghosts of their
               past had forced them to choose between
               love and passion, the veneer of a "fairy
               tale" only a band-aid for a fractured
               life.

     ANOTHER LAPD TRANSFER FORM: "Officer Dwight
     Bleichert...Reassigned to: Scientific investigation
     Detail"

<b>     INT. THE LAPD SCIENCE LAB - DAY
</b>
     Bucky with plastic gloves on typing blood with an eye dropper
     and a test tube. Meticulous and boring.

     News radio plays in the background...

     A Detective pokes his head in:

<b>                          DETECTIVE
</b>               Bleichert? You got those prints for me?

     Bucky pulls a file out of a stack and gives it to him. The
     nonchalance of a man whose job has become routine.

                          DETECTIVE (cont'd)
               Thanks. We gotta hot one I think.

     Bucky smiles politely and returns to his desk. The radio:

<b>                          ANNOUNCER
</b>               ...results in the 1948 Republican primary

               Ellis Loew 64% to 36%...In county
               primaries...

     This gets a smile from Bucky as he returns to his test tubes
     and beakers.

<b>     INT. AN APARTMENT - CRIME SCENE - DAY
</b>
     Detectives comb through a murder scene as Bucky collects
     latent fingerprints off doorknobs. No one pays him any
     attention. He's been relegated to the worst kind of
     purgatory.

<b>     INT. THE KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
     Bucky and Kay drink coffee and read the morning paper. She
     absently strokes his free hand.

     Bucky intently reads the front page.

     The headline reads: "CITY COUNCIL INVESTIGATES '20s BOOM
<b>     BARONS FOR SHODDY HOME CONSTRUCTION".
</b>
     Underneath, a picture of Sprague and Mack Sennett posing in
     front of the HOLLYWOODLAND sign.

     He's startled by Kay tapping her finger on the photo.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               That reminds me of something, Dwight.

     Bucky tries to hide his panic.

<b>                          BUCKY

<b>                          KAY

     The phone rings. Bucky answers it.

               Hello...Hey Vic...

     Bucky writes something on a piece of paper. Hangs up.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Gotta go. Work-up on a probable gunshot

<b>     EXT. A COLONIAL MANSION - JUNE STREET - MORNING

     Bucky rings the bell. He's dressed plainclothes and carries a 
     technician's canvas bag.

     An attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door.

<b>                          WOMAN

</b>               Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted.
               You're the lab man?

     He nods yes. She lets him in and he follows.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS

     He notices for the first time she's dressed for gardening.

<b>     INT. THE STUDY - MORNING
</b>
     Bucky steps over the police rope and into the study. A large
     desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE
     OUTLINE OF A BODY. Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN.

     Behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains
     decorates the white wall and crown mouldings.

<b>                                                            CUT TO:

<b>     A SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
     as Bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls, scrapes
     tissue from the muzzle of the gun, dusts it for latent
     prints, etc. At the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag.

<b>     INT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     as Bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards
     the main foyer. He stops short.

<b>     ON THE OPPOSING WALL
</b>
     hangs a disturbing PAINTING: the portrait of a clown, a young
     boy done up in court jester's garb. His body is gnarled and 
     hunched. He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks
     like one continuous deep scar.

     It is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Short's death wound.

     Spooked, Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby
     family photos--two young women linked arm in arm.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               The other survivors. Pretty aren't they?

     She arrives next to him, dusty with soil.

               finished in the study?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use
               pure ammonia...
                   (looking at the two girls)
               Mrs. Chambers--

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               Jane.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha
               Sprague? The next block over?

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>                   (snorts)
               Those girls and that family. How do you
               know them?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I did a little work for them once.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               Consider it lucky if it was a brief
               encounter.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               How do you mean?

     The hallway phone rings. Jane moves to answer it.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               Back to condolences. Thank you for being
               so nice, Mr.--

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Bucky. Good-bye, Jane.

<b>     INT. THE CRIME LAB - LATER
</b>
     Bucky writes up a report. VIC pokes his head in.

<b>                          VIC
</b>               You finish working up the suicide, Bucky?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about
               the husband?

<b>                          VIC
</b>               Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was
               depressed, failing health. The terrible
               burden of all that money'll get you every
               time.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Wonder how he made it?

<b>                          VIC
</b>               No mystery there. Real estate.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Oh really?

<b>     INT. THE GARAGE - EVENING
</b>
     The garage door is open to the evening air. Bucky's heavy bag
     and speed bag hang on hooks. Bucky leans against a stool, a
     large box open on the work bench.

<b>     INSIDE THE BOX
</b>
     Bucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out A PHOTO
     ALBUM. He opens it and begins flipping through: articles and
     photos concerning Elizabeth Short. MOSTLY PHOTOS.

     It's like a man in a mid-life crisis fantasizing about his
     high school sweetheart.

<b>     OFF ONE OF THE PHOTOS WE DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>     ANOTHER ELIZABETH SHORT CASTING SESSION
</b>
     "Elizabeth Short...Screen Test #5"

     She rambles on, almost oblivious of the camera.

<b>                          ELIZABETH SHORT
</b>               ...I had a fiance, Captain Matt Durand.
               He was in a tank battalion. A Commander.
               He had...the fiercest blue eyes. Like the
               deep water you see from a fishing boat...

     She's lost in thought...we're not sure whether this is a
     scene, her real life, or just a sad lie...

<b>     THE NOISE OF A CAR APPROACHING
</b>
<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     Bucky drops the album back in the box as Kay's car pulls into
     the driveway. He covers it back up.

<b>                          KAY
</b>                   (getting out)
               What're you doing?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I'm...looking for the hammer.

     She points over his shoulder to the hammer hanging in plain
     view.

<b>     INT. THE BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
     Bucky kneels on the ground near the closet, toolbox next to
     him. He pulls on the floorboard, it flexes and squeaks.

     He uses the hammer to pull the board completely off. He
     squeezes wood glue around the edges and is about to replace
     the board when something under the floor catches his eye.

     He reaches into the hole, pulling out STACKS OF HUNDRED
<b>     DOLLAR BILLS BOUND WITH RUBBER BANDS.
</b>
     He spies another scrap of paper in the hole...

<b>     INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME
</b>
     Kay pours two scotches.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Dwight?

     She carries the scotches into the bedroom and finds Dwight
     sitting on the floor, staring at thousands of dollars in
     cash.

     He holds a paper money band inscribed: "$100...Boulevard-
     Citizens Bank..."

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Oh. I...always wondered where he kept it.

<b>     THE BOULEVARD-CITIZENS BANK HEIST - A FLASHBACK
</b>
     A SHOTGUN BLAST shatters the back window of the armored
     truck. In the front seat, LEE BLANCHARD ducks down as the
     driver hits the gas...

<b>     BACK ON THE SCENE
</b>
     as Bucky leans back against the bed.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Were you ever going to tell me?

<b>                          KAY
</b>               He'd given all his money to Ben Siegel.
               (beat) He wanted to give me a home.

<b>     A FLASHBACK - LEE'S CAR
</b>
     Lee and Bucky, their first day as partners...

<b>                          LEE
</b>               ...said I'd get a shot at Joe Louis if
               I'd take two dives for him. I said no...

<b>     BACK ON THE SCENE

     as Bucky looks straight up into the ceiling light...

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Were you ever going to tell me?

<b>                          KAY
</b>               He knew what Bobby was doing to me...How
               he'd used a razor on me...pimped me to
               his friends...

<b>     INT. DEWITT'S APARTMENT - A FLASHBACK

<b>                          KAY
</b>               ...Bobby know nothing about the bank job.
               He and Lee, they never even met. After

<b>     EXT. DEWITT'S TRIAL - FLASHBACK
</b>
     Lee leads Kay out of the courtroom.

<b>     BACK ON THE SCENE
</b>
     as Kay leans down next to Bucky, gently putting her hand on
     his shoulder...

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Then last year...the fourth man--the
               driver--he heard Bobby was getting
               paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt
               that Lee framed him. He wanted money we
               didn't have. Ten thousand dollars.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Ever. Were you ever...?

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Promise me this: Forgive him for DeWitt.
               Forgive him for the bank. It doesn't
               matter anymore. Not to us.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Who was the driver, Kay? Tell me. Tell
               me!

     He's in her face now. Okay, pal, you asked for it.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Baxter Fitch.

<b>                          BAXTER FITCH

     Chaos erupts as Lee executes Baxter Fitch and Bucky kills two
     others...

<b>     BACK TO THE SCENE

     on Bucky's anguished face:

               He used you, Dwight. He did. Forgive him
               everything else. But don't forgive him
               for that. Ever.

     She reaches for his face and he pulls away.

<b>     SLO-MO CLOSE-UP...
</b>
     as the crumpled money drops down into the hole in the floor,
     into the blackness...

<b>     WE FADE UP TO:
</b>
<b>     INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky, stripped to bare chest, attacks the heavy beg.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               Fire and Ice. The hero and the snitch.
               Bank robber and his best friend the
               bumfuck detective. Triggerman. Stooge.
               Weak point in a fairy tale triangle.

     He lashes into the heavy bag with a series of brutal left
     hooks. Kay stands in the door, watching him. Her eyes red
     from crying.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               I would forgive Lee the bank job. And I
               thought I'd forgive Kay her role in
               keeping it from me. But the basic rule of
               Homicide applied: Nothing stays buried
               forever. Corpses. Ghosts. Nothing stays
               buried forever. Nothing.

     Kay turns around and shuts the door behind her.

<b>     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S GARDEN - DAY
</b>
     Bucky and Jane drink iced tea. A glorious garden behind them.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               So. What brings you around again?
               Considering a courtin' the old rich
               widow?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You're not that old. And you're not very
               widowed.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               You either are or you aren't.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You seem to be doing all right.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               Eldridge had cancer. I half expected it.
               We weren't that close anymore...You married?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Little over a year.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               God. Newlyweds. Nothing better, is there?

     Bucky's face betrays his difficulties.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               Sorry.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               So how well do you know the Spragues?

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               Eldridge and Emmett went way back. They
               served on the California real estate
               board together. But Emmett was a bit of a
               crook. My husband got him kicked off the
               board for building dangerous buildings
               under phony corporations.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Your husband sounds like a good man.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               He had his moments. Most of it was out of
               guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro.
               When he learned he had cancer, he really
               started feeling guilty. He voted
               Democratic last year. Even went in and
               had meetings with the City Council. I'm
               sure he gave them dirt on Emmett.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I read an article in the paper.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               Same day Eldridge killed himself.
               Apropos, I guess.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Maybe your husband--

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               My husband was rich and did a mean
               Charleston. I loved him until I found out
               he was cheating on me. Now I'm starting
               to love him again. How strange.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               It's not so strange.

     They watch each other, enjoying each other's company. A
     strange emotional peace.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               You're very accepting of other people's
               frailties. You're young. You should have
               illusions.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I'm a cop. Illusions aren't standard
               issue.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               So how'd a cop get mixed up with
               Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I
               assume?

     Bucky's gut clenches.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I stopped her at a red light. One thing
               led to another. Why do you assume it was
               Madeleine?

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               Don't play dumb, Bucky. The girl's a
               roundheels. Always has been.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Jane. Don't be catty.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               I'm sorry. She can't help it I'm sure.
               She probably inherited it from her
               mother.

     Before Bucky can press Jane stands up with the tray of iced
     tea. The visit is over.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               You figure out the rest, officer.

     He follows her back inside.

<b>     INT. THE HALLWAY - SAME
</b>
     As they stop momentarily in front of the scary clown painting.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               God that is spooky.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for my
               birthday a couple years ago. I hate it.
               Want to take it with you?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               No thanks.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               Thank you, then. You were my best
               condoler.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               And you mine.

     Jane gives Bucky a warm handshake.

<b>     EXT. THE STREET - HANCOCK PARK - SOON AFTER
</b>
     Bucky pulls out of June Street, and passes Muirfield. He
     slows for a moment, squinting down the street, trying to
     discern the Sprague mansion. He drives on.

     We hang on the sign for Muirfield Avenue as the day turns to
     night...

     And down Muirfield Road, we see Bucky's car parked in the
     shadows. Watching the Sprague house. A voyeur.

<b>     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
     Bucky sleeps soundly as Kay readies herself for work. She
     watches him for a moment, considering whether to wake him.
     She decides not to and leaves.

     The minute she goes, Bucky opens his eyes...

<b>     EXT. MUIRFIELD ROAD - HANCOCK PARK - EVENING
</b>
     Bucky spies on the Spragues. He digs back into his seat as
     Madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box.
     Just for a second it looks like she sees him...maybe not...

<b>     INT. CRIME LAB - DAY
</b>
     Bucky dozes, his tie almost catching on fire in a Bunsen
     burner.

<b>     EXT. THE MUIRFIELD ROAD STAKEOUT - EVENING
</b>
     Bucky leans against the window, propping himself up.

<b>     ACROSS THE STREET
</b>
     Madeleine's Packard pulls out and roars up the street. Bucky
     guns his car to follow...

<b>     EXT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky follows the Packard into a crowded GI bar parking lot.
     He parks a distance away. But as he watches Madeleine get out
     of her car he is staggered:

     It's ELIZABETH SHORT.

     Or, more accurately, it's Madeleine dressed up exactly like
     the Dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos. Slinky black
     dress, upswept hair, down to the yellow barrette. She strides
     into the bar...

<b>     INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky ducks into a smoke-filled GI bar where a commotion is
     already taking place.

     Madeleine is surrounded by soldiers fawning all over her.
     Other men simply point and whisper--her Dahlia act isn't lost
     on anybody.
     Bucky slides into a booth in the corner to watch. He signals
     for a drink.

<b>     INT. THE ZIMBA ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
</b>
     Four bourbons later. Bucky watches as Madeleine settles into
     a more intimate conversation with one soldier. Bucky downs
     his drink as Madeleine grabs the GI's elbow and escorts him
     out of the bar.

<b>     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER
</b>
     Bucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier
     loiter outside of A motel room. Madeleine returns from the
     office with the key and lets the two of them in.

     He watches as the light goes on; and then off.

<b>     INT. KAY AND BUCKY'S BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
     Bucky comes into the bedroom to find Kay waiting up for him.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Dwight--

     He moves to her, pulling off his clothes as quickly as he
     can.

                          KAY (cont'd)
               Dwight--

     He's on top of her, his bourbon stained kisses go and down
     her neck and her breasts.

     She responds, but not quickly enough for him. He rushes into
     her before she's ready. Still, she tries to be there for him,
     hoping to catch up with his lust.

     She doesn't. And they both know it. They embrace, trying to
     cover up the hollow awkwardness with familiar affection.

     It doesn't work...

<b>     INT. THAD GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Bucky sits at Thad Green's desk, penitent.

</b>
     Bucky in his patrol car. The night a hot sweat. He listens to
     music on his radio and watches two hookers dance on the
     corner, waving at cars.

     A SCRAGGLY OLD WINO staggers up to the women, stumbling
     around them, dancing with them. They sneer at him, tell him
     to beat it.

<b>     INSIDE THE PATROL CAR

     Bucky flashes his headlights at the bum. The bum ignores him.
     Bucky flashes them again, annoyed.

     The bum looks into the glare and flips Bucky off.

     And suddenly Bucky snaps, jumping from his car. In three big
     strides he's on the bum, clobbering him with roundhouse lefts
     and rights.

     The women are screaming. The drunk is screaming.

     fair-haired Emmett...Photos of Madeleine and Martha, the

     through her almost undetectable. Almost.

<b>     EXT. KAY AND BUCKY'S HOUSE - DAY

     A moving van in the driveway and Kay's Plymouth stuffed with
     boxes. Bucky double-parks and bolts up the steps.

     The van pulls away behind him.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>                   (to the van driver)

     The van driver ignores him; Bucky turns as Kay walks out onto
     the porch.

<b>                          BUCKY

     He reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range.

<b>                          KAY
</b>               Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile.

     She spins out of his grasp and makes for her car. She guns
     the engine and disappears.

<b>     INT. THE HOUSE - SECONDS LATER
</b>
     Bucky stands in the middle of the living room, cataloguing
     the little things. No periodicals on the coffee table, half
     the record collection gone, no candlesticks.

     He picks up the largest chair (Lee's favorite) and throws it
     at the wall. Next, Kay's rocking chair shatters the glass
     cabinets. The coffee table goes through the front window.

<b>     IN THE BEDROOM
</b>
     Bucky yanks out all the drawers, turns over the bed.

<b>     IN THE BATHROOM
</b>
     he takes a pipe wrench to the sink, crushes the mirror with
     one blow...

     In a terrible ten rounder with the ghosts of his past Bucky
     demolishes the dream house, pulls his uniforms out of the
     closet and bolts out of the house, leaving the door open so
     scavengers can pick the place clean...

<b>     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky sits on the bed, his back pushed up against the wall.
     Eyeball to eyeball with Elizabeth Short, Betty, Liz, the
     Black Dahlia.

     A collage of photos and file folders...

<b>                          VOICE OVER

     No clapsticks this time. Just Betty Short sitting an the

     reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings.
     Not sexy. Empty and resigned.

<b>     EXT. WILSHIRE DISTRICT - DAY
</b>
     Bucky, unshaven and out of uniform, leans against his car on
     a working class residential street. He stares across at a
     modest Victorian house and the garage behind it. We recognize
     it hopefully; we've been here before.

<b>     EXT. A GARAGE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     It's Cleo Short's apartment. Or at least it used to be. Bucky
     peers in a window and sees it's filled with junk.

     He walks back towards the street, intent on heading back to
     his car. on a hunch, he walks up onto the porch of the
     Victorian house and rings the bell.

<b>     EXT. THE PORCH - SAME
</b>
     Footsteps at the door. It opens to reveal another identical
     twin to Elizabeth Short.

     Bucky is stunned and can't find his tongue.

<b>                          GIRL

<b>                          BUCKY

     She begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it
     back open.

     Cleo Short, Elizabeth's father.

<b>                          CLEO SHORT

<b>     INT. THE SITTING ROOM - LATER
</b>
     The two men arrange themselves in chairs while the Betty look-
     a-alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind Cleo.

     Bucky tries not to stare. He forces himself to focus on Cleo,
     who, while five years older, looks much better than last time
     Bucky saw him.

<b>                          CLEO SHORT
</b>               Came into a little change a while back,

               give a fuck what you think, you and your
               partner ain't much to look at now. I read
               the papers.

     Bucky can't deny that.

     The young woman brings in two beers for Bucky and Cleo. Bucky
     checks her out again. Cleo knows why.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               My youngest, Christine.

     He squeezes her hand affectionately.

               forgot...Anything she might have said...

     Cleo studies him, knows Bucky's a lost soul. He softens for
     the first time. Leans forward, elbows on knees. Almost
     looking like a father who'd lost a daughter.

<b>                          CLEO SHORT
</b>               She was a terrible actress. I'm sure

               front of the john mirror.
               Once or twice she got me in on
               it...Reading parts with her for some
               audition. She stunk. Even a parent could
               tell. What Beth was good at was writing.
               All her teachers used to say that. Not
               that a grease like me'd know the
               difference. Maybe she coulda written for
               the pictures. But she wanted to be an
               actress like every other silly girl.

     His gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter.

               maybe he thought you'd end up champ?

     Bucky shrugs off any talk of his father. Cleo gets it.

<b>                          CLEO SHORT
</b>               Your momma?

<b>                          BUCKY

     Cleo follows Bucky out onto the porch. Christine reads a copy
     of Photoplay. The cover touts the current Mack Sennett
     Revival in honor of the revised Hollywoodland sign...

               You, too. Get me a sandwich.

     He snatches away the Photoplay and slaps it into Bucky's
     hands.

                          CLEO SHORT (cont'd)
               Clean up some dog shit with this for me,
               willya?

     The man winks. Bucky takes the magazine and salutes him with
     it. He heads back down the walk. Behind him Cleo Short
     watches him go.

<b>     EXT./INT. BUCKY'S CAR - HOLLYWOOD - DUSK

     Bucky sits at a light, staring north. Scaffolding drapes the 
     Hollywoodland sign. Movie lights have been set up, capturing
     the event on film.

     His attention turns to Christine's Photoplay on the seat next 
     to him; the weekly rag is open to an ad for the Mack Sennett
     revival:

     A reproduction of the Hollywoodland sign across the top of
     the page, and below it the words "Keystone Kops at the
     Admiral Theater--Air conditioned!"

     Below that a still from a Keystone Kops movie, registering
     huge and loud and wrong: Three Keystone Kops standing between 
     pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails; a wall
     inset with Egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them.

     Unmistakably the background that appeared in the Linda
     Martin/Betty Short porn film.

     Cars honking behind him. Bucky's transfixed by the image. The
     light is green.

     He jerks upright and squeals out of the intersection.

               mean he had anything to do with a smut
               film twenty-five years later.

     And there's a shot of the porn set--the Keystone Kops running
     around in it like they're solving at crime back in ancient
     Egypt.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Duke Wellington had admitted making it.
               Linda Martin had said it was shot in
               Mexico.

     The short ends with a large pie throwing scene on the porn
     set. The credits begin to roll: "Director--Mack Sennett.
     Scenarist--Mack Sennett. Assistant Director--Emmett
     Sprague"

     On Bucky's face as one last piece of information hits him:
     "Filmed in Hollywood, USA."

<b>     EXT. THE MOVIE THEATER
</b>
     as Bucky bursts out into the evening, the lights on the
     Hollywood hill catching his attention.

<b>     INT. A FLASHBACK - THE SPRAGUE HOUSE
</b>
     Bucky at dinner with the Spragues.

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               Mack Sennett? Helped him build that
               housing project he was putting up--
               Hollywoodland--

<b>     BACK TO THE SCENE
</b>
     as Bucky stares up at the sign.

<b>     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky tears through it, pulling out files. The door opens -
     it's Russ Millard.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               I got your message, Bucky.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Look, Russ...I think...I may have it. I--

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               It?

     Bucky whirls around, gesturing to the room--

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Her! Her! I've got a hot one, padre. It's
               just...

     Bucky flops onto the bed, almost frantic.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Calm down, son. Tell me.

     Bucky meets his eyes: forgive me my sins.

<b>     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky drives with Russ in the car next to him.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               I told him everything. Me and Madeleine,
               the Spragues. Withholding evidence for
               her. Everything. Even Lee. After all of
               it he only had one thing to say:

<b>     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
</b>
     On Russ:

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               All right, then. It's your ball. What do
               you wanna do?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I want to search every fucking inch of
               every goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague
               property if it takes the rest of my
               shitty career. And I know exactly where
               we start.

<b>     INT. BUCKY'S CAR - BEACHWOOD CANYON - NIGHT
</b>
     as they inch their way up into a huge traffic snarl in
     Beachwood Canyon. The sign looms high above them as the "A"
     is taken dawn.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               Between my time with Madeleine and the
               local boom baron expose in the papers, I
               was practically an expert on Emmett
               Sprague's land deals...

<b>     EXT. A PARK AREA AT THE NORTH END OF BEACHWOOD DRIVE
</b>
     A huge area is cordoned off as people watch the sign being
     torn down.

     Bucky and Russ leave the car there, badge the local blue
     doing crowd control, and split off down a dirt side road into
     the woods.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               For the first time since the beginning of
               the whole fiasco, I stopped trying to
               figure out who killed Elizabeth Short.
               Instead, I focused on where.

<b>     EXT. A WOODED AREA - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky and Russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper, like
     two men consulting a treasure map in the woods.

     In the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown
     out and the door hanging off its hinges.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               And if my hunch was right, we wouldn't
               have to look any further than one of
               Emmett Sprague's condemned bungalows. One
               that was isolated...abandoned...

     They walk on, leaving this particular bungalow behind.

<b>     EXT. A STREAM - WOODS - LATER
</b>
     Bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it
     deeper into the night...

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               ...and most importantly, close to a water
               source...where one could drain a body of
               its blood.

     Bucky and Russ round a bend in the stream and see

<b>     THE SKELETON OF A BUNGALOW
</b>
     teetering on the edge of the stream. Empty window and doors
     hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death
     leer.

     Bucky and Russ feel it, tensing up as they approach. They
     pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and
     step into the abandoned house.

<b>     INT. THE BUNGALOW - SAME
</b>
     A scattering of trash in the front room, animal shit, a
     bicycle tire, rags.

     They move through the house, each roam, each closet and
     corner creeps with potential violence. Still, nothing.

     From the kitchen:

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Bucky.

     Bucky joins Russ at the back door, the screen rotted off.
     Through the empty window they see:

     AN ALUMINUM GARDENING SHED, the door wide open.

     You know it before they even get there. But as soon as they
     step inside...

<b>     INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     They know something bad happened here...

     Half the room is taken up by a mattress, its blue ticking
     stained dark brown with blood. A gas lantern sits in the
     corner, leaning against a stack of blood-spattered books,
     including a copy of Gray's Anatomy and Victor Hugo's The Man 
     Who Laughs along with a clutch of pornographic pictures.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               God help her.

     Bucky's already pulling on a pair of rubber gloves from his
     SID days. For the first time we notice he's carrying his
     forensic kit.

     He opens it, revealing the test tubes, fingerprint powder,
     tweezers, etc.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>                   (throwing Russ gloves)
               Box up the books and papers. Maybe light
               that lantern.

     Russ grants Bucky his take-charge attitude. He snaps on a
     pair of gloves.

<b>     A GRUESOME MONTAGE
</b>
     1. Bucky scrapes blood off a wall and into a test tube.

     2. Russ flips through the pornographic material--some of it
     very intense.

     3. Bucky fills up another test tube with dark hair tweezed
     from the caked blood on the mattress.

     4. Underneath the mattress, Bucky finds small pieces of
     rope...

     5. Bucky measures a bloody sole print and traces it onto a
     piece of paper.

     6. Bucky finger prints the whole fucking place, pulling good
     prints from the door jamb, the door, and the wall near the
     head of the mattress.

<b>     OUTSIDE THE GARDENING SHED
</b>
     Russ fiddles with the books, making himself busy. Finally he
     walks back inside.

<b>     INT. THE GARDENING SHED - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Bucky sits on the floor, his hands shaking as he holds a
     fingerprint plate in one hand and a piece of paper in the
     other.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               You all right?

     Bucky hands him the fresh plate. Russ studies it. Bucky hands
     him the piece of paper with a blown-up set of prints on it.
     The two sets of prints are identical. Russ sees the name at
     the top of the paper: ELIZABETH SHORT.

     He exhales deeply.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Thing is, Russ. Thing is...There's
               another set of latents up there on the
               doorjamb...And my hands're shaking so bad
               I can't transfer 'em.

<b>                                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>     RUSS MILLARD HACKING A FOUR INCH SECTION OF THE DOOR JAMB OFF
</b><b>     WITH HIS KNIFE AND SLIPPING IT INTO A PLASTIC BAG.
</b>
     Bucky sits on the ground outside.

<b>     EXT. UNDERNEATH THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN - LATER
</b>
     The last of the "LAND" letters has come down and a party has
     ensued. A marching band plays "There's No Business Like Show 
     Business".

     Bucky and Russ stumble out of the woods, carrying the
     evidence of Betty Short's death in their hands.

<b>     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky sits on the bed, the evidence spread out around him.
     Russ stands in the doorway.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All
               of her.
                   (gesturing around the room)
               All right here.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               Are you sure you don't want to came home?
               Mrs. Millard'll fix up the couch.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               No. Thanks. I'll stay here.
                   (re the doorjamb piece)
               I want to get up early and confirm these
               prints.

     Russ nods.

<b>                          RUSS MILLARD
</b>               You're a very very bright penny, Officer.

     He closes the door, leaving Bucky alone with Elizabeth.

<b>     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               That night I pictured myself the way I
               wanted Elizabeth to picture me--her
               knight in shining armor, a reborn two-bit
               harness bull who cracked the biggest
               unsolved homicide in California history.
               A war hero, a heavyweight champion.

<b>     INT. EL NIDO - ROOM 204 - DAWN
</b>
     Bucky flips through Gray's Anatomy, killing time.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               I stayed with her that night and dreamed
               of all the bullshit that would never
               happen. Not if I wanted to keep my job at
               all. Because there was no way for me to
               make the arrest without admitting that
               I'd suppressed evidence years ago. The
               case would always be open.
               And so while it killed me to wait 'til
               morning, in some ways...this was our last
               night together.

<b>     INT. THE CRIME LAB - MORNING
</b>
     Bucky transfers the killer's prints from the doorjamb to a
     plate.

<b>     INT. A LARGE ROOM WITH FILE CABINETS
</b>
     Bucky pulls a fingerprint card from a cabinet. He shuts the
     cabinet. The tab on the outside reads: "City Employees".

<b>     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - MORNING
</b>
     Bucky edges his way along the side of the house. A side
     window is open and he pulls himself inside.

<b>     INT. THE MANSION - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Moving boxes fill the front hallway. Bucky hears voices
     coming from the main hall. Madeleine and Emmett.

     Bucky unholsters his gun; from his pocket he pulls out a
     SILENCER and screws it on the muzzle.

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE (O.S.)
</b>               ...besides, one of my foremen said the
               goddamn pipes are spewing gas...There'll
               be hell to pay. It's about time I showed
               the three of you good ol' Scotland.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               I don't wanna go to Europe, Daddy. You're
               always talking about how dreadful and
               provincial it is.

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               ...they've got what you need, lassie.

     Bucky steps into the main room, gun prominent at his side.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               And what is that, Emmett? Saps like me?
               Direct line to the straight dope? Or is
               that what you needed?

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               Aaah, laddie.

     He eyes the gun.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and
               the two of you covered it up.

     On the Spragues, trying to maintain their upper-class cool.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
                   (to Madeleine)
               You helped Linda Martin and Betty make
               that stag film. Where was the set? In one
               of Daddy's old buildings?

     He levels the gun at Madeleine. Rock steady. Madeleine sits
     on a divan.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Georgie was always...sneaking around
               Daddy's properties. He saw them make
               it...He...got crazy about Betty.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Of course. She looked like his daughter.

     Off Emmett's shocked look:

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               He fucked your wife. But I don't think
               you cared about that. But he's her daddy.
               And that must have made you crazy. He was
               a handsome bastard, too. Somehow I don't
               think he was disfigured in a car wreck.

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               In the Argonne, Georgie used to bayonet
               the dead Gerries. I saw it. Thrilled him,
               it did. He was...hmm...disturbed. I think
               Ramona found him...a good way to strike
               back at me.

     Bucky points the gun at Madeleine again.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               How'd it all go down?

     She hesitates. He shoots a MING VASE next to her. She jumps.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               So many pretty things here...

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               It was Sunday I remember...Betty
               called...short of cash as usual.
               I put Daddy on, and he offered Betty
               money to date a nice man he knew.
               Georgie'd been driving Daddy crazy,
               wanting to get with Betty ever since the
               movie. Threatening to tell people he was
               my father. But we thought Georgie just
               wanted her for sex.

     Bucky blows away another objet d'art. The two Spragues huddle
     on the couch.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               He was a sick fuck and you knew it!

     Emmett gestures vainly towards the stuffed dog Balto.

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               He was passive. He liked to touch dead
               things. His father was a surgeon, did you
               know that? Famous in Scotland.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               What did you tell Betty? What did you
               tell her?

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               We said he was a war hero. Because we
               didn't want her to feel like a whore.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Then?

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               You know the rest.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Pretend I'm stupid. For old time's sake.

     Madeleine exhales hate.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               I went looking for Linda Martin, and I
               found her at a motel in the Valley. I
               gave her money and told her to say the
               stag was filmed in Tijuana with a Mexican
               crew.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               And then what? I come along? Daddy tell
               you to fuck me or was that your idea?

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Bucky--

     Two more shots from the gun destroy another fifty grand worth
     of art. Bucky reloads.

               The whole family have a good laugh at
               dinner that night? Pumping me for info

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Martha knew I'd been with Betty. But that
               was all. But she's a demon, you know. She
               even called the cops with a tip on La
               Verne's--just hoping I'd get smeared in
               the papers. I scratched her good for
               that.

<b>                          BUCKY

     She nods yes.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               Figures.

     Emmett clears his throat.

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               What are you gonna do?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Passports. All four.

     Emmett walks to a small desk. He reaches into the drawer--
     Bucky puts his gun to Emmett's head--

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               Don't insult me, lad.

     He pulls out the four passports (not a gun). Bucky takes
     them.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               We'll ruin you in court, you know. If you
               go after us, we'll ruin you. Over what?
               Some little slut--

     Bucky blows a hole in a vase some six inches from her. He
     cocks his head at her, as if to say: the next one will be
     closer.

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               You know, laddie. The rich don't
               necessarily own art just for themselves;
               we safekeep it for future generations.

     The dig crosses through Bucky's mind for a moment before he
     shooes it away. To Emmett:

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I need to see it.
<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               It?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Just to be sure. I need to see it.

<b>                          EMMETT SPRAGUE
</b>               I'm not sure I know...

     Bucky puts the silenced muzzled half an inch from Sprague's
     brain.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I need to see his grave, you tightass
               kiltwearing motherfucker. Where'd you
               bury George Tilden?

<b>     EXT. A PAUPER'S CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
     Bucky stands in front of a plain grave marker: "George
     Tilden. 1906 - 1948.  War Hero and Loyal Friend"

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               When I'd pulled George's print card that
               morning, I'd already laid fifty down with
               Russ that he was our guy. Amateur
               taxidermist, transient. If he was a cop
               39th and Norton woulda been right in the
               middle of his beat...

<b>     INT. THE ROOM WITH THE FILE CABINETS - FLASHBACK
</b>
     Bucky pulls Tilden's card and we see the close-up: "George
     Tilden". Added by hand: "Deceased"

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               But I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
               wanted to nail the sicko myself, giving
               him ten rounds of Bleichert rage.

<b>     EXT./INT. THE ALUMINUM GARDEN SHED - DAY
</b>
     Bucky watches as Russ tips the gas lantern over on its side,
     the gas leaking out into the tin shed.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               Maybe he'd have gone for a gun or
               probably a knife, and the Bleichert fists
               would've given way to a full load of .45
               in the chest.

     Bucky and Russ step outside. Russ lights a match and tosses
     it inside. Flames begin to eat away the bloody mattress...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Sprague said they found him croaked in a
               parking lot downtown, just twelve blocks
               from where he'd dumped Betty Short. Just
               croaked. Natural causes, if anything
               about crazy Georgie was natural. I hoped
               the evil ate him from the inside out,
               filling him with blackness like the
               sawdust in Sprague's goddamn dog. (beat)

     Bucky kicks the tin door shut, sealing the fire inside
     Elizabeth Short's private hell.

<b>     INT. JANE CHAMBERS HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
     Bucky and Jane Chambers drink some iced tea.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               ...and then Eldridge said: I'm sure
               that's the case Mr. Mayor, but that's not
               my dog and those sure as hell aren't my
               shoes!

     They laugh, Jane a bit more than Bucky. She narrows in on him.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               It's so nice of you to stop by again. Of
               course you've been staking out the
               Sprague house. Four nights in a row.
                   (off his surprise)
               I walk my dog every night. And I'm almost
               as nosy as you.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>                   (covering)
               Yeah, well. Old habits die hard.

     He gets up from the table.

<b>     INT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Bucky wanders over and stares at the slash-mouthed clown
     painting, always transfixed by it.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>                   (re the painting)
               I'd been thinking about giving it to
               charity, but it's too valuable. I found
               Eldridge's receipt...

     She wanders into the study and fishes out some papers from
     her late husbands desk while Bucky continues to stare at the
     clown. She returns, reading from the sale slip.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               It's a Frederick Yannantuono original,
               inspired by an old classic novel--The
               Man Who Laughs by Victor Hugo.

<b>     A FLASHBACK - THE GARDENING SHED
</b>
     A blood-spattered copy of The Man Who Laughs on the pile of 
     pornography--

<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     As the slash-mouthed clown towers over Bucky, his head
     buzzing...

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               The clown in the painting is the book's
               main character, Gwynplain. When he was a
               child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear
               and then sold to the 16th century Spanish
               aristocracy to be used as a court jester.

     Bucky steps back.

                          JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd)
               Are you all right, Bucky?

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Yes, I'm fine.

     He focuses on her.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Where'd Eldridge get the painting?

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               You'll appreciate the coincidence--

     She hands him the receipt.

<b>     ANGLE ON THE RECEIPT:
</b>
     "Received from Eldridge Chambers, $3500 for the sale
     of the F. Yannantuono painting. Ramona Cathcart
     Sprague, January 15, 1947."

     Speechless.

<b>                          JANE CHAMBERS
</b>               What is it--

     He's out the door.

<b>     EXT. JANE CHAMBER'S HOUSE - SAME
</b>
     Bucky runs to his car, pulls out his gun. He sprints off down
     the street...

<b>     EXT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - SAME
</b>
     Bucky waits outside, watching from behind a tree. He watches
     as the last of the cars, Madeleine's, pulls out of the
     driveway.

     He crosses the street. He tries the front door, surprised to
     find it unlocked. He goes inside.

<b>     INT. THE SPRAGUE MANSION - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Gun drawn, Bucky cases the downstairs. He hears a noise.

<b>                          RAMONA
</b>               I'm in here, officer.

     A red wave of sweat washes over him. He walks carefully into

<b>     RAMONA'S SITTING ROOM
</b>
     where the matriarch sits on a tiny sofa, her arms lost in a
     silk dressing gown. Her face puffy and her eyes dark, her
     gray hair frizzy.

     Bucky trains a gun on her.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               I know what you did, Ramona. You and
               Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold
               it the day of the murder. You know I've
               got the book. And now I've got you.

     She smiles. Very slowly she withdraws one of her hands from
     the folds of her dressing gown. She holds a tiny ladylike
     revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet. When she
     speaks, it's with complete control.

<b>                          RAMONA
</b>               We see you out there, you know. Every
               night. We see you. You don't fool us. You
               didn't hurt Georgie. You didn't hurt
               Madeleine. And as much as I wish you
               would, you didn't hurt Emmett. You're a
               voyeur. That's all the lesser classes
               have. Pressing their nose up against the
               glass.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               So tell me. Let me see.

     She smiles at him again, loving his need.

<b>                          RAMONA
</b>               Emmett slashed his face, I'm sure you
               know. Madeleine was eleven and she looked
               just like Georgie. When he got out of the
               hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a
               present. My Gwynplain. But he was afraid
               of Emmett's rage...After that...we rarely
               spoke.

     Bucky eases himself into a chair opposite her.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Tell me about Betty Short.

     Her face hardens.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
                   (with venom)
               It was the cruelest of jokes. He'd become
               obsessed with her...That filthy film.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               Your husband bought her for George.

<b>                          RAMONA
</b>               Emmett never stopped hating me.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               For George--

<b>                          RAMONA
</b>               For being richer than he was.

     She looks over her nose at him.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               I followed them to the bungalow. There
               was a baseball bat under...under a
               tree...She tried to run from me...but she
               was drunk. The first swing knocked her
               out. I made Georgie tie her to the
               mattress....The second swing woke her up.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               You tortured her.

     She seems to drift.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               She looked so much like my Maddy. It
               was...the cruelest of jokes.

     Her thousand yard stare gradually returns to Bucky.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               Martha mustn't know. She's all that's
               left of this family that isn't dying. You
               consider her when you decide whether
               we're worth it.

     Bucky's not sure what to say next. She fills the space quite
     well.

                          RAMONA (cont'd)
               Honestly, though. Sometimes I thought
               Martha was going to bring the whole
               family down around her by chance. Her
               little stunt about tipping the police to
               LaVerne's--

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               She lied about that. To get Madeleine's
               goat.

     Ramona's eyes brighten up.

<b>                          RAMONA
</b>               Oh is that so? You poor boy. Your life is
               worse than mine. Maybe the cruel joke is
               on you.

     She speaks with such an insanity and calm it frightens him.
     And on Bucky's hungry eyes we

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He

<b>                          KAY
</b>               You are so, so good at some things.

</b>               He was going to leave no matter what. I

     Bucky looks like he's about to burst. He wants to go to her,
     lock her in his arms and forgive. instead, he just backs up
     three steps, slowly turns on his heels, and walks out.

<b>     INT. A BAR - NIGHT
</b>
     Bucky sits in the back of the bar, shrouded in smoke and loud
     music. He drinks bourbon and watches Madeleine over at the
     bar. She's got her hand on a soldier's knee.

<b>     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - NIGHT

     Madeleine Sprague and the soldier boy walk from the office
     over to the now familiar Room 11. They enter, shutting the
     door and flicking on the light to reveal

<b>     BUCKY
</b>
     sitting on the back of a chair with his feet on the seat. He
     trains his silenced pistol on them. Flashing his badge, he
     points the soldier to the door:

     Now she's curious.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               It's not as good as yours, I'll admit.
               But then again you've got an ear for
               accents. Accents, dressing up in
               costumes...

     Maybe a trace of fear in her eyes...

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Do another one for me. Play someone else.
               Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's
               girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do
               another.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               I don't know what you're talking about--

     He cocks the gun.

<b>                          BUCKY
</b>               How 'bout the Mexican accent you used
               when you hired the private dick to track
               down Lee. Let's see the make-up job.
               Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita,
               that you wore when you chased after poor
               daddy's money. Tell me something--you
               shoot Lee yourself?

     She steps back against the door as he advances.

                          BUCKY (cont'd)
               Did you at least have the guts to shoot
               him yourself?

     He puts the gun to her forehead.

<b>                          MADELEINE
</b>               You'll never do it. Never. Remember...I
               look like her.

     She grins wickedly.

     He pulls the gun from her head and shoots her in the kneecap.

<b>     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - LATER
</b>
     Cap cars, flashing lights, an ambulance.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               We took the fall together.

<b>     INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER
</b>
     Madeleine is interrogated by Homicide dicks.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               Ever the consummate actor, Madeleine
               Sprague confessed to killing Lee by
               concocting a love triangle from the three
               of us...The Bleichert/Blanchard rematch
               fought over her hand, with Lee beating
               Emmett and demanding he "hand over" his
               daughter when she preferred me.

<b>     EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
</b>
     As Madeleine, dressed as a Mexican woman in heavy makeup and
     a large hat, tails Lee back to his motel...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Madeleine stalking Lee...Revenge-killing
               him in Ensenada to avenge the Sprague
               honor...No mention of the Black Dahlia
               murder case at all.

<b>     EXT. THE COURTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Madeleine led away amongst a flock of photographers. Her
     family linked arm-and-arm in the background, crying, only
     Martha looking like she might survive...

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Her story's enough to get her a psych tag
               as a delusional schizophrenic and ten
               years at Atascadero State Hospital.

<b>     INT. THE POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Bucky sits at a table, staring into the one-way mirror.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               So the brass girl took the fall for the
               whole family. And I took the fall for me.
               IAD cleared me on the motel shooting--a
               cop's code make-good for Blanchard's
               snuff.
     WE PULL OUT and see Bucky's cuffs, badge and gun sitting on
     the table in front of him.

                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)
               Afterwards I was fired from the Los
               Angeles Police Department on grounds of
               moral turpitude and conduct unbecoming an
               officer. I thought of turning over Ramona
               in hopes of pulling a grandstander's
               turnabout...

     THE CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH THE ONE-WAY MIRROR revealing RUSS
     MILLARD standing on the other side.

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               ...but I had people to protect...People
               who already knew that, for the briefest
               of times, and in the darkest of places, I
               had been so, so, good at some things.

<b>     INT. THE EL NIDO - NIGHT

     Bucky standing amongst the Dahlia files. He begins pulling
     photos off the walls...

<b>     INT. BUCKY AND KAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     The destroyed fairy tale house is in mid-repair. Kay is in
     work clothes, painting a new trim in the living room.

     The front door opens. Bucky stands in the doorway, carrying a
     box of Dahlia files. Kay watches as he crosses the room
     without a word and dumps the box of files into the fireplace.
     He tosses on a match and the box goes up in flames.

     She moves to him.

<b>     INT. A CASTING OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     We arrive just as she exits, the outline of her body quickly 
     disappearing into the blackness beyond the office door...

<b>                          VOICE OVER
</b>               Thank you Elizabeth.
