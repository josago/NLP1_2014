           FRANKIE crawls through a dog door. She walks into the living
           room where the TV is on loud.
                         
           DEAN PERIERA, 30 years old, hefty, sleeps in a lazyboy.

           The back door opens and Dean carries Frankie to the yard. The
           first yellow rays of sunlight hit their faces.
                         
           He looks over the lawn, an empty bowl, water tin and a
           doghouse posting the name MEGAN. He peeks inside the
           doghouse. There's no one home. Dean moves to the fence. The
           gate is open.
                         
           Dean carries Frankie to the front yard. They look around.

           CINDY PERIERA, 28, sleeps in bed. Sunlight spills through
           translucent yellow curtains into a small master bedroom.
                         
           Dean sets Frankie down on the bed, motions to her to be
           silent. He sniffs the air. She follows. They eye each other
           and pounce. Cindy wakes up with a gasp.

           Cindy, nursing a weight-loss drink, scans through digital 
           photos on the computer. We see - family on vacation,
           Frankie's first day of school, Frankie and a black and white
           Border Collie mutt - Megan. Cindy exports the picture when...
           A tea kettle whistle blows.
                         
           Dean and Frankie sit at the table. He plays a song for
           Frankie on a ukulele. Cindy gets up, turns off the kettle.

           Frankie reluctantly takes a tiny bite. Her face sours and she
           lets the food fall out of her mouth and back in the bowl.

           He scans through messages from a bunch of names of people

           sets her on the ground running back to the porch. She gets
           caught in the diameter of the sprinkler spray. She screams as

           with mutual love, pride and respect - connected by their

           Finds a pen. Dean writes his name across the card. Hands it

           he holds. He runs his hands through his hair, looks in horror
           at twelve fallen hairs in his palm. He washes them down the

           - (Penny & the Quarters or Dynamite Four) It sounds really
           good right now. Drink in hand, she begins to sway to the

           It's been years since they danced in front of each other, and
           it makes them a little embarrassed to be doing it now. The

           less they are exposed. Soon, they are slow dancing, still
           holding drinks. They don't feel as vulnerable now. The cotton
           on Dean's robe feels good to Cindy's fingertips, she traces
           invisible pictures on his back. Dean burrows his nose into
           Cindy's neck, inhales deeply.

           Dean is tentative, but goes along with her. He starts slow,
           but she eggs him to go faster. He runs in circles picking up
           speed until he is in a breathless, circular sprint. He can't
           keep up with the centrifugal force.

           world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to
           insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair
           snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile
           away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets
           off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps
           falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on
           all fours, laughing.

           and end up on their backs and out of breath, side by side,
           looking up at the stars. They are both covered in sweat. We
           see their breath.

           kisses his flexed bicep. Cindy lifts her hand. A fork is 
           stuck in the back of it. She looks at it with curiosity.

           Cindy opens the door and Dean scoots, making room for her. He
           lets out an "ow" before extending his hand.

           Cindy reluctantly joins him on the bathroom floor. Their

           Tears well up in her eyes. Dean rolls on top of her. He cups
           her face in his hands and stares long into her watery eyes.

           After a moment, their lips meet in an awkward rejuvenation.
           She moves her head away and pats Dean on the shoulder in a
           gesture of friendship. Dean kisses her neck.

           Cindy bites her lip. He slides his hand between her legs.

           She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues
           to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy
           turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand
           away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms 
           underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over
           her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her
           face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She
           arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis
           pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into
           her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his
           forehead.

           Cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts
           the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door
           jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly
           moves one hand up and down her bodice.

           He unbuckles his belt, pushes his pants and underwear down to
           his knees, holds himself in his hand. He lowers onto her.
           Cindy adjusts her legs higher. He rotates his hips, looks
           away in concentration. Cindy's arms move around him, grabbing
           the small of his arching back. His pelvis humps in a feeble
           performance. A small moan. Cindy's eyes press closed harder.
           The erratic motion slows... stops. Dean's raspy breathing.
           His weight covers Cindy. She opens her eyes to the ceiling.

           She looks at him. His head faces away. She rolls out from
           underneath and stands. She wraps her dress around her and
           slips into the bedroom.

           Back against the closed door, Cindy turns the lock. Her eyes
           shift from despair to relief. Her gaze grows more wild. The
           doorknob jiggles. A secret, crazy laugh builds in Cindy that
           she suppresses. Dean presses his face into the bedroom door. 
           He talks to her. 
                         
           On the other side of the door, Cindy listens. Dean's voice
           cracks. A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door.
           She searches the room for an escape. There are no windows,
           the only way out is through the locked door. Trembling, she
           wraps her arms around herself. She tries to make herself as
           small as possible. The spaceship bed is the only place where
           she can disappear. She crawls underneath the covers, curls
           into a tight ball. Sadness lets loose. Cindy's body pulses
           with faint, painful tears. The black walls of the room
           twinkle with stars suspended in space. The cries get lost.

           Drunk, Dean and Cindy make out on the street corner. It is
           cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each
           other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy
           makes a move. She unbuttons Dean's Pea-Coat, feels the shape
           of his chest, his abdomen, his back.

           skin on her lower back. She recoils from the icy touch.

           Dean and Cindy tiptoe in the apartment as quietly as they
           can. They can't keep their hands off each other. Dean makes a
           bed for them on the couch where he sleeps - straightening out
           a couple white sheets. They crawl under with clothes on.

           He gets back on the couch. They kiss. Slowly. Silently. Their

           removed and there is alot of movement, but the details of

           room and into the kitchen. Dean and Cindy pantomime sleeping.

           himself a bowl of cereal, crunching. They feel like he's
           watching them. Cindy tries her hardest not to laugh. Jake
           stares at the trembling sheet with contempt before returning

           Glenda continues with a little speech about choices, and
           needing to be able to make mistakes with our choices. Her

           - They eat. Dean compliments the meal. Glenda is self
           depreciating. Jerry is judgemental. Gramma wants to go home.
           Cindy can't take her eyes off of Dean - she has fallen.

           Dean walks out the front door where he passes Jerry who
           stands on the porch. He moves across the lawn to the
           sidewalk. Vermillion light falls in the sky.
                         
           Cindy sets Frankie down and she runs out the door. Jerry
           catches the little girl by the arm and holds her tight.
                         
           Dean walks toward the horizon.

           Jerry releases her and Frankie runs fast to Dean. She jumps
           at him to go into his arms. He doesn't pick her up. From the
           porch Cindy and Jerry watch Dean as he points to them.
           Frankie doesn't move. Dean yells for her to go back. Frankie
           heads back to her mother, confused. Cindy kneels down and
           takes her in her arms.

           The houses form neighborhoods that join with other
           neighborhoods forming towns. Beyond the towns, hills stretch
           far into to the horizon. Fireworks explode against dark blue 
           on blue.
