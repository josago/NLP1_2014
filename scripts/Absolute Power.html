    The saddest eyes you ever saw.

    We are looking at an El Greco drawing.       It is a study for
    one of his paintings.

<b>    PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
</b>
    A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,
    the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so
    brilliantly.

    Most of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban
    housewives are there too.

    And one older man.

    This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly
    dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a
    successful company executive.

    As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great
    concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss
    nothing: He has pilot's eyes.

    We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this
    is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the
    hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --

    Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the
    eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.

    Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his
    work a moment, shakes his head.

<b>                                GIRL STUDENT
</b>               May I?

    She's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts
    thumbing through.

    The sketchbook as the pages turn.

    Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The
    hands are better. Very skillful.

      An enigmatic smile.    Now, from that --


<b>2     EXT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                          2
</b>
      A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here
      but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the
      houses neat and well tended.

      Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's
      afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.


<b>3     INT. RED'S BAR - DAY                                       3
</b>
      Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working
      class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man
      Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They
      are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.

                Your life would be a whole lot
                simpler if you could learn to
                operate a V.C.R.

<b>                              LUTHER
</b>                My only failing.

      As he turns --


<b>4     EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                   4
</b>
      A street of   small row houses. Clean, well tended.
      Luther walks   toward one. Later in the afternoon. He
      carries half   a dozen small shopping bags, from the
      market, the   hardware store, the drug store, the cleaners.

<b>5   EXT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DAY                                    5
</b>
    A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door.
    Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly,
    bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front
    door.


<b>6   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                          6
</b>
    as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer,
    lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food
    away --


<b>7   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT                    7
</b>
    Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle.
    Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther
    himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it
    down.

    A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley
    sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on
    another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan
    cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass.
    Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.

    Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a
    photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little
    girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands
    alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at
    them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.

    Luther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, looks
    out the window.

</b>
    Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the
    hands and eyes and faces --

    -- we are looking at something totally different:   a
    mansion.

    HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion.

<b>    KEEP HOLDING.

    PULL BACK to reveal --

     In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing.

     But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we
     are looking at ten thousand square feet. Wealth and
     power.

     We're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark.
     Totally deserted. Silence.

     Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO
     VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The
     lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides
     to a stop. Again, silence...

     HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     There
     is a small field between the car and the estate.     Now --


<b>11   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                11
</b>
     A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears
     dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,
     begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --

     -- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his
     entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last
     sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast,
     so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught
     again.


<b>12   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                        12
</b>
     The grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a
     backpack.

     The night is cool.

     He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is
     a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't
     gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.

     One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off,
     in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground.
     He makes no sound at all.


<b>13   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                     13
</b>
     Thick wood with reinforced steel.

     Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens
     it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer
     of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a
     key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the
     instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:

     -- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more
     than six inches long --

     -- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside
     in the foyer next to the front door.

     The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --

     Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts
     the security panel away.

     The BEEPING sound is constant --

     -- and getting louder.

     A tiny device, no bigger than a pocket calculator. It
     has two wires protruding from it. It is, we are about to
     find out, a tiny computer. Luther holds it like a baby.

      He allows himself to exhale. Then he's busy again,
      unhooking the computer. His fingers, as always, work
      quickly, precisely.

      The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack,
      moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again
      shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place.

      It's as if he hadn't been there at all...


<b>26    INT. SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT                    26
</b>
      Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the
      vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it
      looked in the moonlight.

      A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past
      it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a
      late one, when the madness had him and things were
      sliding away. Very sad.

      Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --

      -- then surprisingly he raises his hand,  and for just an
      instant traces the lines of the painting  in the air, as
      if trying to figure out how the magic was  done, as if
      getting ready for his next museum session  --

      -- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the
      third floor.

      Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an
      overpowering sense of being alone --

      -- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow,"
      moves on.

      Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor.

      The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see
      a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby
      girl, the next one of the same child at three.

      We watch the child grow up in these photos.    At ten she
      is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.

      Not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into,
      if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret. The kind of girl
      you ached for in high school. The perfect cheerleader.

      These are pictures, we will come to know, of Christy
      Sullivan. A high school graduation shot at eighteen, a
      shot in front of a Burger King at twenty.

      Christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling
      happily. We can only see her face and the wedding veil
      here. Now --

      A glorious and expensive white wedding dress.    Christy
      holds a bouquet of flowers. Breathtaking.

      And now we can see the groom. Walter Sullivan. Walter
      is smiling too, one arm proudly around his lovely bride.

      Walter, it might be noted, is eighty years old.

      Luther, staring at the photo, shakes his head.    Now he
      moves on.

      Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside,
      closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down,
      takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up.
      Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied
      bed.

      A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver
      clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop
      the other, several more photos of the happy couple --

      -- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a
      thick leather handle.

      Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large
      full-length mirror across from the canopied bed.

      Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself,
      he's studying the mirror itself.

      He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs
      and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.

     Three remotes on a side table. Luther carefully picks up
     the middle one, crosses the room with it, points it at
     the large mirror, clicks once --

     -- and the mirror swings silently open.

     A room is revealed. All we can see of it so far is this:
     There is an armchair in the middle facing where the
     mirror had been.

     Luther turns back toward the sitting area, the remote
     held in his hand.

     The side table. Luther puts the remote down -- very
     carefully. In the exact position it had been. Now he
     takes a moment, blows on his hands, rubs them together.

     Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his
     backpack, moves with the work light into the revealed
     room --


<b>30   INT. SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - VAULT - NIGHT                 30
</b>
     It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally,
     piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables
     we'll get around to.

     Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for.

     He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it
     that is identical to the one he replaced at the side
     table.

     Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work.
     First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large
     denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of
     slender boxes --

     The first box as Luther opens it.

     Into the duffel it goes.

     Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel.    And
     still more. As he continues to do this --

     All is quiet. High on a wall, the security light beams a
     friendly green.

     Now, from somewhere, a distant sound.   LAUGHTER?   Was it
     laughter? Doesn't matter, it's gone.

      Luther has moved deeper into it -- he's finished with the
      jewelry. Now he's examining piles of bonds.

      Into the duffel they go.

      He takes a breath, glances around.    Perfect.

      Coins.   Antique ones.   They disappear into the duffel.

      Stamp books.   Gone into the swelling duffel.

      Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER.     Not so
      perfect.

      He moves quickly out of the vault, takes a step toward
      the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER, closer. Two
      people. A man and a woman.

      Luther stops, mutters "shit!" -- glances around -- No
      place to hide. Luther, grabbing his backpack, moves into
      the vault, turns off his work light, and shuts the door
      with the remote. The DOOR CLICKS --

      -- Luther is alone in the darkness.

      A burst of LAUGHTER now.    Growing nearer still.

      Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down,
      doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped,
      Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe...

      Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened.

      the open bedroom door.

      Two people are briefly visible as they enter, a MAN and a
      WOMAN. The CLINK of GLASS. Stifled LAUGHTER.

      The Woman closes the bedroom door.

      Darkness again.

      And now the LAUGHING sound increases.    GIGGLING, really.

     it's over.

     Luther blinks, confused, looks around --

     -- because it isn't over, he hasn't been caught.

     The door to the vault is suddenly gone. Luther is
     staring straight into the goddamn bedroom.

     Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he
     was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen.

     Just a few feet away, just outside the door.

     Where things are clearly starting to heat up.

     Luther moves to the armchair, sits.    There is nothing to
     do now but wait. He settles in.

     They are staring at each other.

     We have seen the woman already -- she's CHRISTY SULLIVAN.
     But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice.

     This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman.
     Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep
     blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered
     black dress. An expensive necklace.

     One more thing:   she is staggering drunk.

     The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome
     and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit.

     Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the
     husband in the wedding photo. (2) He is drunker than she
     is.

     Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers.     He
     fills them, gives one to her.

     They touch glasses.    Down the hatch.   Tight laughter.

     He looks at her.

     She looks at him.    There's a lot of sexual tension in the
     air.

     But now he begins looking around, checking things out.
     She spots this.

     He nods then, more at ease.    And he blows her a kiss.

     She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him.
     Her body moving very slowly.

     He pours himself another shot, chugs it, watches.     Now --

      Then they are into each other's arms. Their bodies

      say, "naughty, naughty" --

      dress falls off her body. Her breasts spring free. She
      is wearing only her panties now and high heels. And a
      smile.

      She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have
      always gone nuts over her and she knows that too. And

      back, caresses her neck, begins sucking her nipples.

     she cries out in pain but he still won't stop so she
     slaps him in the face. He slaps her back, viciously,

     throat --

     around for something, anything -- her fingers finally
     close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she
     slashes his right arm.

     arm.

     and blood pours from her nose and   mouth and if she
     weren't so scared, maybe it would   have stopped her, but
     it doesn't -- because somehow she   manages to maintain
     balance --

     -- and knees him all she has, in the nuts.

     lies on his back, holding his crotch.

     Richmond, staring stupidly at the letter opener. He
     drops it back to the floor, tries to stand, can't.
     Burton helps him back to the bed. Which is when he
     passes out cold.

     There is the sound of a VACUUM -- it's later now.

     The place is incredibly changed. Christy is lying as
     before -- except now she is fully dressed. The bed has
     been made with clean sheets. There is a large black
     garbage bag that Collin shoves the sheets in, dumps in
     Christy's jewelry. Burton is VACUUMING the rug.

     Richmond is visible, still in terrible shape, finishing
     putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom.

     uses the bed table to try to steady himself.

     backs toward the door, vacuuming carefully. Then --

      Burton and Collin, behind him, can't see him yet, but
      they are moving faster --

      -- and Burton could probably destroy anyone in a fight --

      -- but Collin can fly.

      Luther, and twenty yards ahead of him are some woods that
      spur him on, he pumps his arms, his body straining and
      his breath coming in gasps and...

      Everything is as it was -- calm and peaceful --

      -- now a museum guard moves into the doorway, scanning
      the room.

      Luther -- a quick glance over, then back to his
      sketchbook -- and from that glance it's clear all is not
      calm and peaceful.

      Homicide Detective of Middleton County, Virginia but he
      had a decade of top work in New York City. Bright,
      funny, and tough enough for anything you want to throw at

      He kneels beside the body next to an older man. This is
      the MEDICAL EXAMINER, fat and bored. Seth studies

      A high rise. It's in a different part of Washington than
      we've seen thus far. Afternoon now.

      An old salesman type is trudging into the building. He's
      slumped, carries heavy salesman type suitcases. He wears
      a battered hat. As he goes inside --

      backpack from the robbery --

      At 80, his body may be betraying him -- he was once
      handsome -- but his mind is that of a young man.

      We've seen him before -- in the wedding picture on the
      wall of his mansion. With his young bride Christy.

      He is with her again now, at the morgue. A sheet covers
      her body. The toe tag is visible. Walter, shattered and
      desolate, stares at her once joyous face.

      recognize is Sandy Lord, deep in conversation with
      several other men. Now, someone says his name.

</b>                Mr. President.

      And on those words -- The 44th President of the United
      States. He has all the natural charm in the world. He
      is remarkably bright, with a phenomenal memory. He is,
      also, at this moment, one of the most popular men in
      American history, three years into a brilliant first
      term, a shoo-in for re-election when that ritual comes.

      His name, by the way, is Alan Richmond, and we've seen
      him before, most recently lying drunk in the back seat of
      a dark Towncar.

<b>                              RICHMOND

      He and Sandy start out of the room. A well-dressed woman
      moves with them. She is Chief of Staff and her name is
<b>      GLORIA RUSSELL.
</b>
      Two men in suits follow behind. Burton and Collin are
      their names and they are the best the Secret Service has
      to offer.

                   There had to be an architect,
                   right? You'd be able to tell
                   which one from public records in
                   the library. And once you know
                   the office, you could break in and
                   find the plans and Xerox them, get
                   them back before morning.

               what's hard is breaking in so no

      Sullivan for a moment is uncertain. He points to himself
      -- "do you mean me?" Richmond nods, opens his arms out

      The Bartender, surprised, turning toward Luther. He
      starts to say something, stops; something tells him to
      shut up and he does.

      A bright late morning of what's going to be a beautiful
      day. A guide leads the people through a doorway. They
      troop happily along.

      Luther is with them; he seems happy too.

      The guide leads the people through. They look around,

      Luther follows the guide out too.

      Except a large envelope has been dropped on a side table.

      MOVE IN ON the envelope --

      -- it's addressed to Gloria Russell.

      Gloria Russell.    Terrified.

      Her doors are closed, Russell is at her desk. Burton
      stands alongside. Collin, silent, sits in a corner.

      And on her desk, half out of the envelope, is a photo-
      graph of the letter opener.

      Burton stands there, massively powerful. His voice, when

      On her desk, a baby picture of Kate and her mom smiling
      -- but there is something a little different about it.

      Seth enters and they shake.    He glances around --

      -- sees the photograph, glances away.

      even though they are both standing still, they are both

      Three police sergeants on MOTORCYCLES, GUNNING through

      Kate, standing now, looking down -- and then she sees it

      new hat and --

      Seth, and it's all gone wrong and it's all going crazy
      and there is noise and there are shouts and there are
      whistles.

      after someone we can't quite make out.

      A tall uniformed police lieutenant, entering Cafe
      Alonzo --

      -- he passes a couple of guys in chef's hats and the
      Chinese waiter who just gapes out toward what was his
      service area --

      -- the tall uniformed police lieutenant moves gracefully
      past --

      -- it's Luther.

      He goes to the front door of the place, glances back
      toward where the NOISE is still mounting -- shakes his
      head -- out the door and gone!

      A well-dressed man rounds the corner; he holds a small,
      beautifully-wrapped package with a small envelope
      attached. He moves to the Doorman.

      PULL BACK to reveal Gloria Russell, looking just
      splendid, the necklace around her throat, entering a
      large and very impressive White House dinner-dance.
      Clearly an important affair of state.

      We've never seen Russell quite      like this -- relaxed,
      secure in her femininity. She       nods distantly to Burton
      and Collin who are, as always,      close the President. For
      the first time now, we realize      something: Gloria Russell
      is hot for Alan Richmond.

      Richmond, on the edge of the dance floor, chatting with
      some elderly couples, several of them European, all of

      Kate turns a corner --
