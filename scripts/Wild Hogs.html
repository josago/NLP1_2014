</b>
          ANGLE ON: BILLY MATTHEWS, 8, ravenously eating a plate
          of hashbrowns, runny fried eggs and syrupy waffles.

<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
</b>          Doug?...
          We see DOUG MATTHEWS, 40's, sitting across the table,
          staring at his son, Billy. Doug is handsome in that
          honest, sincere way. A guy you would call to help you
          move a couch. He watches Billy scoop up his hashbrowns
          with a frosted pop-tart. Billy catches his Dad's look
          and grins with his mouth full. Doug smiles back, then
          looks down at his own plate. He has scrambled egg whites
          and sliced tomatoes. His smile fades away.

<b>          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Doug?
          Doug snaps out of it and looks up at his wife, KELLY
          MATTHEWS. She's attractive, with a patient smile.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          I've got some stuff to do for the party
          tomorrow. Can you take Billy to school?

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          What "stuff"? This party isn't going to
          be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a
          wing platter from Costco?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          It's a our 10th anniversary, Doug. Its
          going to be a nice party with nice food
          and nice music. And wings have carbs, so
          you can't eat them anyway.

<b>                         BILLY
</b>
<b>                         (MOUTH FULL)

          Doug gives Billy a look.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          No you won't. Because I'm going to
          scrape the batter off.

<b>                         BILLY
</b>          That doesn't work.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          I went to medical school. You think I
          don't know how carbs work?

<b>                         BILLY
</b>          Dentists go to medical school?
          Doug looks a little insulted.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          Doug, can you take Billy or not?

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Yeah, I can take him. There aren't any
          emergencies at the office this morning.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          You have emergencies?

</b>
<b>                         (INDIGNANT)
</b>          Yes, I have emergencies. That's what my
          pager is for. one beep from that thing,
          and bam. I'm off. Like a cheetah.
          Billy, now pouring lucky charms into a bowl, looks up.

<b>                         BILLY
</b>
<b>                         (MOUTH FULL)
</b>          The battery ith gone in that thing. You
          took them out for the TV clicker.
          Doug gives Billy a look.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          I did do that. I forgot about that. I
          need to get some batteries in there.
          Because dentists do have emergencies. We
          are doctors, you know? We take the same
          oath. The oath of saving lives.
          Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms.
          Billy swats his hand away.

<b>                         BILLY
</b>
<b>                         (MOUTH FULL)
</b>          Uh uh. Carbth.
          Doug nods, defeated, as Billy hops up and dumps the
          remaining lucky charms in the trash.

<b>          INT. VOLVO - LATER THAT MORNING
</b>
          DOUG drives a Volvo station wagon along the streets of
          Cincinnati. BILLY is next to him, in the passenger
          seat, looking bored. Doug notices.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          You know, I use to race a car like this.
          Put a hemi under the hood... Nobody saw
          me coming.

<b>                         BILLY
</b>          Really?

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Yup. It could really... smoke some ass.
          Billy raises his eyebrows, impressed. Doug smiles. This
          was a good time to break the "no saying ass" rule.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>          Yes, sir. They called it the dragon
          wagon. You're lucky to be in here
          without a helmet, pal. We both are.
          Doug downshifts a gear, and the tame engine roars
          artificially. Billy is impressed.

<b>                         BILLY
</b>          Awesome! Hey, can I jam the radio?

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Heck yeah, you can jam the radio.
          Doug tussles Billy's hair and smiles.

<b>           SMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
          The Volvo pulls up to a red light. Radio Disney blares
          "MICKEY LOVES MAMBO" from the stereo. BILLY bobs his
          head along with the music. DOUG looks out the window
          and sees a mid-twenties guy in a Porsche, staring at him.
          Doug nods hello, then awkwardly faces forward.

</b>

<b>           VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE
</b>          Bob?...
          BOB LEVENSTEIN, 40s, is working at his computer. Bob is
          good enough looking, but with a gawky wimpishness and
          burdened eyes. He tries to ignore the speakerphone.

<b>          VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE (CONT'D)
</b>          Bob!?
          Bob cringes at the shrill, female voice.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Hey, honey.

<b>          VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE
</b>          You need to come tell Haley she can't go
          to a party tonight.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          (into speaker phone)
          Well, I'm technically at the office right
          now, so...
          The door behind him flings open, and KAREN LEVENSTEIN,
          attractive and harsh-looking, steps in holding a phone.

<b>                         KAREN
</b>          Are you kidding me!? You work in our
          guest bedroom, not an office.

          actually makes us money, Bob. So, get
          out here and tell Haley she's not going
          anywhere!
          Bob nods obediently and hurries out of the room.

<b>          INT. BOB'S HOUSE / KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER
</b>
          Bob enters the kitchen. His five year-old daughter,
          CLAIRE, wearing a dance leotard, walks up to him and
          smiles.

</b>
<b>                         EEEEEIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAA1
</b>          Bob winces, and looks around for his other daughter.

<b>          SFX: PHONE RINGS
</b>          Bob reaches for it, but his other teenage daughter,
          HALEY, runs in, wearing a denim mini-skirt and Ugg boots.

<b>                         HALEY
</b>          No!! Don't touch that! It's Julien!
          Haley snatches the phone away from Bob.

          but CLAIRE enters and looks up at him.

</b>          I have a shareholder meeting. And we
          agreed that my career would be the
          priority, and you would work out of the
          house. You might not like it, but my job
          is higher paying. And I don't see you
          complaining about that hundred dollar
          shirt you're wearing.
          Bob looks down at his too-hip dress shirt.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          You bought this shirt for me. I was fine

</b>          Take it off! You don't want to wear nice

          Bob sighs and takes the shirt off. Karen snatches it
          from him.

<b>          INT. BOB'S CAR - A MOMENT LATER
</b>
          Bob sits in the car, SHIRTLESS, next to Claire. He looks
          over at her, and notices a pink hoodie in her lap.

<b>                         BOB

<b>                         CLAIRE

<b>          INT. CHILDREN'S DANCE STUDIO - FIVE MINUTES LATER
</b>
          A bunch of kids in dance leotards are starting a class.
          Claire comes running into the group, as Bob enters behind
          her, wearing the pink hoodie. It's way too small, and
          doesn't quite cover his belly. He sits with the parents
          and nods awkwardly to them. It's embarrassing.

          We see WOODY STEVENS, 40s, handsome, but with shifty eyes
          and a Michael Keaton hairline, walk through the stylish
          house speaking into a cordless headset.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          .No, you listen to me. You're not
          going to push me around. We agreed on a
          price, and that's the price I'll pay. If
          you don't like it, walk away... but you
          can kiss your business good bye, because
          that's what happens when you screw with
          Woody Stevens. You go down. Hard.
          As Woody talks, he passes by framed magazine covers of a
          beautiful model, (CLAUDIA) as well as some pictures of
           his wedding day with her, their exotic vacations, and one
           blownup glamour shot of Woody, shirtless, oiled and
          holding a greasy wrench.

<b>                          WOODY (CONT'D)

          Money's never a problem. You just need
          to honor the correct price. Got it?
          Woody gets his answer, and angrily throws the headset
          down on a stack of moving boxes. He marches to the front
          door and throws it open.

</b>          .Then go home, Toby! You make me sick!
          ANGLE ON: The front yard. A ten-year-old boy is
          standing with a rake, surrounded by leaves. He clicks
          off his cellphone and shrugs.

<b>                         TOBY
</b>          I can't do this many leaves for ten

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Well, you should have thought of that
          before you put the "any yard for ten
          bucks" flyer on the telephone pole.
          You're done on this block, now. And that
          goes for your band fund-raisers, too.
          I'm not buying any candy bars no matter
          what parade you dorks have to get to!
          Woody slams the door closed. Toby kicks at a pile of
          leaves, then starts home.

          ANGLE ON: DUDLEY FRANK (late 30s), an odd-looking, curly-
          haired guy with black plastic glasses that are slightly
          too big for his face. He stares at a computer in front
          of him.

</b>          Alright, Mac. I'll show you.
          Dudley clicks a few keys and nods satisfactorily.

          Dudley laughs good-naturedly.

          Dudley jumps forward and starts hitting the keys.

          Dudley frantically starts ripping the power wires out of
          the computer. The monitor goes dark. Dudley touches it
          sadly, then looks over at a cat sitting on the edge of
          the desk.

</b>          Looks like it's still just you and me,
          icat.
          Dudley reaches out to pet the cat. It hisses at him
          angrily, and he quickly pulls his hand back.

</b>
          DOUG, now in his lab coat, sits at his desk, playing with
          a model of a mouth. The phone rings and Doug answers it.

<b>                         DOUG

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Me? Oh, yeah. I've got a mouth right
          here in front of me.
          Doug takes a dental tool and hammers on the plastic
          mouth.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          Don't they mind you being on the phone?

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Well, it's not attached to a head,
          really. More research.
          Doug hits the mouth too hard and all the teeth fall out.
          He fumbles to stop them from scattering everywhere.

</b>          Oh. Well, I just wanted to tell you I
          found a great rate for the Ritz-Carlton
          tomorrow night. I Thought it might be
          romantic. Mom can stay here with Billy.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          I don't know. Do you think we really
          need to stay at a hotel? I mean, Billy
          has his own room. Why don't we just buy
          new sheets? Like, hotel-colored ones.
          It'll be like the Ritz, but we won't have
          to pay to make phone calls!

<b>                         KELLY
</b>
<b>                         DOUG--

          Suddenly, the speaker comes on overhead.

<b>          VOICE ON SPEAKER
</b>          Dr. Matthews? Patient emergency in room
          eight.
          Doug snaps to attention.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Emergency?

<b>                         (INTO PHONE)
</b>          I've got to go! Emergency!
          Doug jumps out of his seat and scrambles over his desk
          and out the door.

<b>          INT. DENTAL EXAM ROOM - A SECOND LATER
</b>
          Doug flies into an exam room, where a hygienist, DANA, is
          looking into a male patient's mouth.

<b>                         DANA
</b>          Doctor Matthews. Finally. Take a look
          at this.
          Doug looks in the man's mouth and nods.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Acute molar abscess. That's going to
          need emergency surgery.

<b>                         DANA
</b>          That's what I thought. Thank God you got
          here.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Well, let's send him over to an
          Orthopedic surgeon.

<b>                         DANA
</b>          Absolutely. Thanks, doctor.
          Doug nods. He looks around for something else to do, but
          there's nothing. He moves a dental tool away from the
          edge of a tray, smiles politely and exits.

<b>                         DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. DOUG'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
</b>
          DOUG, looking depressed, pulls into the driveway. He
          looks over and sees BILLY and three of his friends
          shooting baskets. He smiles, gets out of the car and
          struts over.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>
<b>                         (TO KIDS)
</b>          Yo! Matthews is open.
          Billy looks up and cringes a little bit, but passes the
          ball to DOUG. Doug dribbles it under his leg and charges
          the basket.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>          Taking it into the paint. Who's got the
          D? Whoop, too late, dudes! Booya!
          Doug jumps up to slam the ball, but only hammers it into
          the rim. The rim clangs loudly and the ball goes flying
          backwards. Billy's friends laugh a little. Doug
          notices.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>          Well, that's not really my shot. I
          usually hit from downtown, you know?
          Doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back
          to the three point line.

</b>          That's where the big games get won. Back
          here from the three--
          Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads
          towards the basket, then falls down five feet before it.
          It looks more like a pass than a shot. Billy hangs his
          head, humiliated.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>          That was a pass, dudes!
          It wasn't.
          Doug nods with false confidence to the kids, stands there
          awkwardly for a moment, then quietly heads inside.

<b>          INT. DOUG'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER
</b>
          DOUG enters and finds KELLY. She smiles and kisses him.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          Hey, honey. Snack?
          Kelly hands Doug a sandwich bag of celery. He looks over
          to the table, where Kelly has laid out Ritz crackers
          covered in cheez whiz, for the kids. Doug puts the bag
          of celery down.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          I'm okay. I think I'm just going to go
          meet the guys for a beer.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>
                          
          Okay. Lite beer, if you want to stick to
          that diet.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>
                          
          Right. Yes. Lite beer. No carbs. Just
          delicious beer... water.
          Doug smiles and heads upstairs. Kelly looks concerned.

          Doug enters his bedroom and shuts the door behind him.
          He sits down on the bed and lets out a long sigh.

          After a moment, he gets up and walks over to the closet.
          He opens it and we see: A leather biker jacket, leather
          chaps, boots, gloves, a black "half-helmet," etc. For
          the first time, we see a genuine smile come over Doug's
          face.

</b>
          The garage door on Doug's house rolls open like a theater
          curtain, and Doug, wearing the full leather biker getup,
          idles out of the garage on a gleaming, chromed-out Harley
          Davidson Fatboy. He looks around the neighborhood
          cockily, smiles, then kicks the bike into gear and rides
          into the street. The camera rotates around him and comes
          to rest on the back of his jacket, where we see a large
          patch that reads "Wild Hogs." The camera ZOOMS IN ON
          THIS, and it becomes:

          BOB creeps through the living room. From the kitchen, we
          can hear KAREN, HALEY and CLAIRE screaming things at him,
          about him, etc. He just tip-toes to the hall closet and
          opens the door. We don't see what's in it, but see Bob
          smile the same way Doug did, and...

<b>          SMASH CUT TO:

<b>          EXT. BOB'S DRIVEWAY - A MINUTE LATER
</b>
          BOB, in leather biker gear, rolls out of his garage on
          another shimmering Harley Davidson. He looks around
          through his mirrored aviator sunglasses like a complete
          bad ass. He looks down the street and spots DOUG, riding
          towards him. Bob rides down the driveway and joins
          alongside Doug. They nod silently to each other and tap
          fists like the toughest guys in the world. We see Bob is
          also wearing a "Wild Hogs" jacket.

          He passes by a BMW 645, several stacks of labelled moving
          boxes, and finally a beautiful Harley Davidson Softail
          Anniversary Edition.
          A MINUTE LATER, Woody pulls onto the street on his
          Harley. DOUG and BOB turn the corner and nod to him.
          Woody nods back, revs his engine, and joins alongside
          them.

<b>          EXT. DUDLEY'S COMPUTER-CLUTTERED GARAGE - SAME TIME
</b>
          We see a garage crowded with disassembled Apple
          computers, printers, and a Harley Davidson Sportster.
          Out walks DUDLEY, who's biker outfit doesn't quite mesh
          with his thick-lensed eyeglasses.
          Dudley cockily pulls on a "Wild Hogs" jacket, kick starts
          the motorcycle, presses a button to open the garage door,
          and rides the motorcycle out. However, as he gets
          halfway out of the garage, the garage door catches on
          something, and snaps back down. It clotheslines Dudley
          off the bike, which rolls down the driveway and into some
          garbage cans. Dudley lays in the driveway, staring up at
          the sky with a pained look on his face.

          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride towards Dudley's house, but find
          DUDLEY sitting in his driveway with his arms around his
          knees. He shrugs and motions to his motorcycle - Which
          he has stood back up, but has a bent wheel and smashed
          headlight. Doug and Bob take in the situation and then
          look at Woody. Woody rolls his eyes...

<b>          EXT. STREET - LATER
</b>
          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride along. We see DUDLEY is riding
          bitch on Woody's bike, and Woody doesn't seem thrilled
          about it. The camera pans around and we see they are all
          wearing "Wild Hogs" jackets. And on this, we:

          Woody is obviously humiliated to have Dudley behind him,
          as they park the bikes among a crowd of other bikers.
          Dudley climbs off the back of Woody's bike and pats him
          on the shoulder.

          Doug continues into the bar, but now with less swagger.

<b>          INT. "BYKER'S ISLAND" BIKER BAR - A MOMENT LATER
</b>
          The guys are sitting at a worn table. The place is
          crowded with curiously gentle-looking bikers. Woody
          looks around the bar with a smirk.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Man, I wish we could find a place that

          Suddenly, a large, bald biker comes up and slams a beer
          down on their table.

          The guys all look at him for a beat - then the Bald guy
          cracks a smile.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Hey, Paul.
          PAUL laughs at his joke.

<b>                         PAUL
</b>          Hey, guys... Woody, your tax return is
          almost done, but I want to talk to you
          next week about incorporating. A lot of

          (angrily, to group)
          What the hell are you staring at!?
          Paul glares at the other guys for a beat, then cracks up.

          change. Let's go on our own trip this
          year. Just us, like it was in college.
          Forget these guys. Forget Daytona beach.
          Bike Week is just corporate white guys
          playing dress up. This bar is, too. And
          we didn't get into this to play dress up -
          we got in this to live. "Be cool and
          Ride free." That's the Wild Hog creed.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          No, it's not. It's the slogan for the
          Downtown trolley.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          I know. But, it works as our creed, too.

<b>                         DUDLEY

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Well, what kind of trip are you
          suggesting? Another bike week somewhere?

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          No. That's the best part. We don't do
          some planned out trip. We follow the
          open road. U.S. 50. The backbone of
          America. We take a week and go all the
          way to San Francisco. Think about it,
          guys. Camping out, stopping wherever we
          want, whenever we want... Just freedom.
          When was the last time we had that?
          The guys consider this, but look sceptical.

          been riding with this club for years. Do
          we really want to miss out on that?
          One of the bikers, KENT, approaches carrying a box.

<b>                         KENT
</b>          Hey, dudes. Check these out.
          Kent holds up a sleeveless t-shirt with a big cartoon guy
          on a motorcycle - with the words "Born to Be Wild!
          Daytona ride, 2005." It's horrifying.

<b>                          KENT (CONT'D)

<b>                         DUDLEY

          Dudley grabs a shirt and starts to pull it over the t-
          shirt he already has on. Woody gives a look to Bob and
          Doug.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Look, We'll talk about it tomorrow. But

          several guests dish steaming pasta and cream sauce out of
          a chaffing dish. He looks down at his plate of field

          Doug looks around the party. Several middle-aged couples
          are dancing on the living room floor. Others mingle,
          laughing... Everyone is having a great time, except Doug,
          who stands there, listless.

          how it's been with everything. Romance,

          and throws it into a storm drain.

          You don't need GPS to discover America.
          We just need the wind, our bikes, and
          freedom. And if we have an emergency, I
          always have a cell phone--
          Woody takes out a cellphone. Doug grabs it and throws it
          in the storm drain.

          Woody gives Doug a long look, then slowly smiles.

          Dudley throws his cellphone, but instead of going into
          the storm drain, it goes flying into traffic and smashes
          against an oncoming pickup truck. We hear the truck
          screech to a stop after it passes them.

          the freeway ramp. We hear the truck driver screaming
          profanities as they guiltily ride away.

          The four guys ride along the highway, through the hills

          A family in a station wagon pulls up to next to them.
          Two kids press their faces against the windows, looking
          at the bikers in awe. Bob looks over at the kids in his
          mirrored sunglasses and gives them a badass nod. The
          kids are amazed. Bob looks to Doug. Doug grins. They
          love this. Bob gives a signal to the other guys and guns
          his engine. The others nod, gun their engines and speed
          away from the station wagon. The kids watch with their
          mouths open.

          It's now pouring rain. The guys ride along in misery,
          getting soaked. After a moment, the station wagon from
          before pulls back up to them. The kids are still pressed
          against the window, staring at the drenched bikers. Bob
          looks over and tries to give them another cocky nod - but
          now it's just embarrassing.

          The sun has gone down, and the guys have found a deserted
          area off the highway to set up camp. DOUG, WOODY and BOB
          lounge by a fire - with a tent set up behind them. Doug
          is roasting marshmallows and Bob is straining to blow up
          an air mattress.

<b>          EXT. ROADSIDE US-50 -- THE NEXT MORNING
</b>
          BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY are all sleeping on Bob's air
          mattress, like four sardines. Doug opens his eyes to see
          a large figure standing at the foot of the air mattress.
          It's a stern-looking highway patrolman.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>          You guys all right?

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Yeah. Yeah, just on a road trip.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>          All right. Just making sure.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Looks pretty comfortable, actually.
          We see the highway patrolman has started rubbing his
          thigh. Doug quickly jumps up, waking the others.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Okay, well... Thanks for stopping. Have
          a nice day, officer.
          The highway patrolman laughs.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>          All right, I get it.

<b>                         (WINKS)

          Doug is mortified. The officer looks them over for a
          moment.

          Dudley gets up and puts his arm around Doug. We see he's
          wearing a saggy pair of briefs and nothing else.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>          Well... Have a good one.
          The patrolman walks off. Dudley looks at Doug and grins.

</b>
          The guys cruise through the rolling prairies of Missouri.
          It's another beautiful day. They ride in formation,
          until Woody's bandana doo-rag blows off. Woody goes back
          to get it. The other guys stop and wait for him to
          return.

<b>          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER
</b>
          The guys are still riding - but now the heat of the
          Missouri plains is taking it's toll. They look boiling,
          and have sweated through their clothes. Bob takes a
          drink of water from a bottle of water, then pours the
          water over his head. He breathes a sigh of relief, until
          he hears an angry yell behind him. He looks back and
          sees Woody is now drenched from the water. Bob smiles
          sheepishly as Woody burns.

<b>          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
          The guys ride through the forested Ozark uplands, looking
          even hotter than before. Doug spots a waterfall pouring
          into a crystal clear spring, and points to it. The guys
          nod in agreement.

</b>
          DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY wade into the spring water in
          their boxers. You can see on their faces that it's like
          dipping into heaven. After a moment, BOB walks up.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Thanks for waiting for me, jerks.
          The guys look up to see that Bob is naked. He smiles and
          cannonballs into the water.

<b>                         BOB (CONT'D)
</b>          Whhheew: Yeah! That's c-c-cold:

          Doug wiggles his boxers off and holds them in the air.

</b>          I will find old Doug!
          Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore. Dudley
          smiles, takes off his briefs and holds them up.

</b>          I will... Do what Doug does!
          Dudley throws the briefs to shore. They all look at
          Woody. He rolls his eyes and takes off his boxers.

</b>          I will be naked with my gay friends, and
          if they look at my jock, I will kill
          them.
          Woody throws the boxers to shore. The guys all look at
          each other and smile. It's a nice moment.
          Until a family approaches.
          Doug looks at the other guys, wide-eyed, as a family with
          three young kids walks up with a picnic basket. The
          young kids run and jump into the water. The Dad of the
          family laughs and shakes his head.

          The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys. The
          Dad is still staring, not sure what to do.

          silence, Doug looks at the guys.

          The guys are back on their bikes, cruising along the
          wheat fields of Kansas. They're looking tired once
          again, but suddenly Doug smiles...
          On the horizon, a bar comes into view. Out front are
          several rows of Harley Davidsons. Doug points it out to
          the guys and they all smile. It's like an oasis.
          The pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes.
          Bob immediately falls to the ground.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Dammit! Leg's asleep.
          The guys go to help Bob up, as Dudley gets off his bike
          and falls to the ground.

          A MOMENT LATER. Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their
          sleeping limbs, as Woody looks up at the bar.

<b>                         WOODY

          Look at this place. America!

          The bar is full of bikers, but not the kind we saw
          before. These guys are greasy, tattooed and menacing.
          We see their jackets say "Hells Angels." The bikers turn
          and stare at WOODY, DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY.

          I'm surprised we've never seen you in
          Daytona.
          The bikers kind of chuckle to themselves. The leader of
          the gang, JACK, steps forward. He's in his late 40's -
          and looks like he could break you into bite size pieces.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Yeah, how do we keep missing that?
          The bikers all laugh. Doug and the guys join in, though
          they don't quite get what's so funny.

          We see DOUG, BOB and WOODY riding away from the bar,
          looking very glum. The camera PULLS OUT to reveal the
          rusty sidecar is now attached to Woody's bike. DUDLEY

          home. We have families, jobs, wives...
          or cats... We're not going to piss off a

          Woody looks up at him. Something about this has sparked
          something in Woody's eyes, but he covers it up with a
          calm smile.

          convincing people and these are just
          people. You guys wait here.
          Woody starts up his bike. Doug and Bob look at each

          Woody rides up to the bar, and looks back to make sure
          he's out of Doug, Bob and Dudley's sight. He sees that
          he is, and kneels next to the line of Hells Angels
          motorcycles. He takes out an army knife, and slices
          through one of the motorcycle's gas line. Gas starts
          leaking out onto the ground and Woody nods.

          Woody goes along to each bike, smiling with a weird
          recklessness as he slices through each gas line.

</b>          Anyway, none of that worked. So I laid
          it out for them. I said, "Hey, go ahead
          and assault us. Because we might be not
          be real bikers, but we know real lawyers.
          And the moment you touch us is the moment
          you get your ass sued. Because this is
          the real world - with real laws, and real
          consequences." And they backed down.
          The guys are impressed.

</b>          You really said that?

          Dudley's bike on the way back, so let's
          go. Quick. Before they change their
          mind.
          Woody quickly starts his bike and rides on. The guys
          shrug, impressed, and follow him.
          After a moment, we see them all speed by the bar.

<b>          INT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME

          Jack is playing darts with the other bikers. He goes to
          throw a dart and hears engines roar past the bar outside.

          He quickly turns, which makes the dart he was throwing
          fly off target and stick into the shoulder of one of the
          bikers, (OILCAN).

<b>                         OILCAN

</b>          Saddle up, boys. Somebody doesn't listen.
          The guys nod and head outside. Oilcan pulls the dart out
          of his shoulder, and stops by Jack on the way out.

<b>                         OILCAN
</b>          Try and watch the throws, okay Jack?
          Jack glares at oilcan for a beat, then jabs a dart into

          The Hells Angels roar away from the bar on their
          motorcycles. They get to the end of the driveway, and
          the bikes sputter and choke to a stop.
          ANGLE ON: JACK. He's on his hog, with a cigarette
          dangling out of his mouth. He looks down in confusion at

          You've gotta be kidding me.
          Suddenly, the cigarette falls out of Jacks mouth, and
          onto the ground. A puddle of gas from the sliced line
          catches on fire.

          Almost as quickly as the bikers can turn to look, the
          flame has reached the parking area and ignited all the
          puddles of gas. They all watch in horror as the fire
          ravenously engulfs the old wooden porch of the bar, then
          the roof ...

          plume of smoke back in the distance. A look of worry

<b>                         DOUG

          DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY ride along the highway, as

</b>          Come on, Woody. It looks like a neat
          town. And Dudley's got another bag of
          poop to throw away.
          Dudley nods. Woody grits his teeth as they enter the
          town. It's a quiet, one stop-light town - with an old
          fashioned main street and town square. We see a banner
          over the street advertising a block party that night.
          It's a postcard version of small town America.

<b>          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME
</b>
          The owner, BUD, is pressed up against the glass -
          watching the motorcycles come down Main street. He
          shakes his head.

<b>                         BUD
</b>          Oh, don't tell me they're here again

          Bud walks back to the bar, past his daughter (and diner
          waitress) MAGGIE, 28, pretty in that cute, small town
          way.

<b>                         MAGGIE
</b>          Just stay calm, Dad. At least it's not
          all of them, this time.

<b>          EXT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME
</b>
          The guys pull up to the diner and we see the local
          pedestrians hustle away. The street is soon deserted,
          but the guys don't notice.
          They go to park their bikes, but there's not enough
          space. There's a police car in the parking spot next to
          them, and the town sheriff, CHARLEY, comes running
          towards it from across the street.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          I'll move it! Hold on, I'll move it!
          Charley jumps into the car and backs it out of its spot.
          The guys look at each other, surprised.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Wow. Lucas is a polite town.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          That's how these little towns are. It's
          unspoiled America.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          It's a shithole. Let's keep moving.
          The guys ignore Woody and enter the diner.

<b>                         WOODY (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay, we'll get it to go, then. We can
          ride and eat if it's wrapped in a
          tortilla.
          Woody gets no response. He looks back down the road,
          uneasily, then follows the guys in.

<b>          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - SAME TIME
</b>
          BOB, DOUG, WOODY and DUDLEY enter, with their motorcycle
          boots thunking on the wood floor, announcing to the
          entire diner that there are bikers there.

          Everyone freezes and the place goes silent. The only
          sound is a single fork dropping onto a plate.
          BUD is pulsing with anger, but he swallows it down.

<b>                         BUD

</b>          I'll take care of them, Daddy.
          (to guys, extra polite)
          Good morning.
          Maggie smiles. She has a radiant sweetness, even though
          she's scared to death.
          DUDLEY stares at her, captivated. He's in love.

<b>                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)

</b>          Are there any booths open?
          All the people quickly jump out of their booths.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Wow. Everyone is so nice, here.
          The guys sit in one of the booths. Dudley hangs back,
          and struggles to talk to Maggie.

          Dudley tries to think of something else to say, but
          can't. He nods awkwardly, then heads over to the booth.
          He sits down with the guys.

          but I could only think of black jokes.
          Maggie, still very skittish, approaches the table.

<b>                         MAGGIE

          Doug looks to the next table, where a man is enjoying
          french toast.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Mmmm. I'll have what he's having.
          Maggie nods obediently and takes the man's plate. She
          slides it in front of Doug.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>          No, uh... I'll take a new one. He can

          Bob hammers his fist on the table and laughs at his joke,
          but Maggie starts to cry. The guys suddenly look
          confused as she runs to the kitchen in tears. Bob looks
          back to the guys.

          We ANGLE TO SEE: MAGGIE rush over to calm BUD down. Bud
          calms down, then hears another motorcycle engine roaring
          down the street. He looks out the window and shakes his

          The guys look at Bob, wide-eyed. woody looks worried.

          talking to just like his friends did,
          Woody.

</b>          But, Bob. I don't think--

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Let me do this, Woody! You stood up to
          them last time, and I just sat there like
          I always do... Well, not this time!
          (turns to Murdock)
          Listen, you piece of shit. You think you
          can just walk around and bully perfectly
          nice people? You think that's how it
          works? Well, guess what? This is the
          real world. With real laws and real
          consequences. You hear me!?
          Bob swats Murdock's beer out of his hand. It spills all
          over him. Murdock is too filled with rage to speak.

<b>                         BOB (CONT'D)
</b>          Now get out of here! And if that gang of
          inbred assholes needs things explained to
          them again, tell 'em the Wild Hogs will
          be right here in Lucas tonight.
          Woody puts his face into his hands.

<b>                         BOB (CONT'D)
</b>          Now get.
          Murdock just stares daggers at him.

<b>                         BOB (CONT'D)
</b>          Get!
          Bob kicks the stool out from under Murdock. He almost
          falls, but catches himself on a stool. He glares at the
          guys, but he's outnumbered. He grits his teeth and
          storms out the door. Woody winces to himself as he
          watches Murdock go. This isn't good.
          After a moment, BUD comes running out from behind the
          bar.

<b>                         (GIVES UP)
</b>          Yeah, I was hiding in the kitchen.
          Charley looks at them for a moment, then starts to tear
          up.

</b>          I'm an embarrassment.
          Charley hurries off to the bathroom. The guys look at

<b>          EXT. MAIN STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
          CHARLEY walks through the town square with DOUG, BOB,
          WOODY and DUDLEY. There's a stage and booths set up
          around the park in the center - ready for the block
          party. As the news spreads that the Wild Hogs are
          friendly, the townspeople start to take to the streets
          again.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Sorry about all the confusion when you
          arrived. Those guys are pretty rough.
          You're the first people to ever stand up
          to them.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Hey-- we should probably share the
          credit. I mean, I just basically kicked
          that guy's ass. Man! You know how good
          that felt!? Yeah!
          Bob punches a handicapped parking sign, which rattles
          against its post, then falls to the ground. Bob
          immediately looks regretful.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Nice. Now the paraplegics can park down
          the block and get more exercise.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          (suddenly meek again)
          Should I fix it? Oh, man. I should.

<b>                         (TO CHARLEY)

<b>                         CHARLEY

          cripple and he gets pulled around in a
          wagon. Come on, I want to show you guys
          something.
          Charley leads the guys off.

<b>          INT. POLICE GARAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
</b>
          Charley flips on the light in a neatly organized police
          garage. In the middle sits a sparkling, unridden Harley
          Davidson police bike.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          You ride this?

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Oh, no. The Hells Angels would take it
          to pieces if they ever saw me on it. I
          just keep it in here. Polish it and so
          forth. But I'd never let them see it.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Those guys are that big of a problem,
          huh?

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Yeah. They ride into town a few times a
          month and get drunk, damage property...
          Basically turn the place upside down.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          And the police don't do anything?

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Well, It's a small town - and me and the
          Dooble brothers are the only law. And
          they're still pretty green.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Can't you call a bigger town or something
          for backup?

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Yeah, I've done that a few times. But
          the gang is always gone by the time they
          get here. We've also tried wearing riot
          gear, which does protect you from being
          hit, but not from being dragged. Also,
          one of the Dooble brothers tried to throw
          tear gas, but the bottle exploded and
          blew off his ear.

<b>                         DUDLEY
</b>          Ech.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Yeah, he's hard to look at.

<b>                         (THEN)

          The guys look flattered. Except Woody.

</b>
<b>                         (TO DUDLEY)
</b>          We'd be honored to stay. Thank you.
          Woody's looks at Doug in protest. Doug gives him a stern
          glare.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          And if you're not in a rush to leave in
          the morning-- We've got a great trout
          stream you might want to check out.

<b>                         DUDLEY

          Doug shrugs.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Sure. Let's do it.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Uh uh. No, I'm putting my foot down,
          here. I still get a vote on what we do,
          you know? And I want my vote.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Okay. Of course you get a vote.
          Woody nods and looks at Bob and Dudley. They clearly
          intend to stay.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          I actually get three votes. Because I
          planned the trip.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          But you didn't plan the voting system. I
          did. So you only get one. Sorry.
          Doug, Bob and Dudley walk off. Woody fumes.

</b>
          MURDOCK has arrived at the bar, which is just a burned
          shack at this point. The Hell's Angels are gathered
          around, watching JACK beat the crap out of a remaining
          wall with a pipe. He finally stops when the wall has
          crumbled.

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         JACK
</b>          No! I'm not-- I'm going to put my foot
          up their asses! Both feet! Hell, I'm
          going to stick anything I can in their
          asses, and I'm going to enlov it.
          The guys start laughing again. Jack boils red.

          The guys start towards their bikes. Oilcan sidles up
          next to Jack.

          you know?
          Jack looks at Oilcan for a beat, then bends down, picks a
          dart up out of the ash, and jabs it into his shoulder.

<b>                         OILCAN (CONT'D)

<b>          EXT. MAIN STREET HOTEL - THAT AFTERNOON

          DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY exit out of an old fashioned
          hotel next to the diner. They cross to the town square,
          where the block party is in full swing. Townspeople
          mingle around eating corn-on-the-cob and hotdogs. Up on
          the stage, a plump, middle-aged man with a goatee and a
          polo shirt tucked into dockers - sings Justin
          Timberlake's "Rock Your body."

</b>          The man drops to his knees at the edge of stage and
          reaches his hand out to the audience, like the star of a
          boy band; However, it's clearly making the people on the
          dance floor uncomfortable.
          Meanwhile, Doug, Bob, Woody and Dudley walk through the
          square and are instantly greeted, patted on the back and
          thanked by each townsperson they pass. The word is out
          that these guys are heroes. Doug gives a "can you
          believe this?" look to the other guys - who are just as
          thrilled as him. They're eating it up.

<b>                         DOUG

</b>          Yeah, well... He once bit me on the
          sack.
          Dudley walks off towards the beer tent. Woody looks to
          the other guys with a puzzled look.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          It's true. He was unclogging his bathtub
          drain and the cat thought it was a ball
          of yarn.
          Doug and Woody wince.
          ANGLE ON: DUDLEY, at the beer tent. He gets in line,
          and realizes he's behind MAGGIE. She smiles at him.

<b>                         MAGGIE
</b>          Hi.
          Dudley is wide-eyed.

<b>                         MAGGIE
</b>          Wow. You like macs too, huh? I've got a
          vintage Apple 2e. Restored it from

<b>                         MAGGIE
</b>          Wow. I like fig newtons.
          Dudley collects himself and tries to speak.

<b>                         DUDLEY
</b>          Yeah. They're like fried chicken at a--
          No, that's not... Dammit! This is hard.
          Maggie smiles sweetly as Dudley fumbles.

</b>          You want to dance?
          Dudley goes to respond, then decides to just give an
          emphatic nod. Maggie smiles.

          DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at a picnic table,
          drinking beer out of plastic cups. They lean back and
          soak up the small town celebration around them. It's a

          CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies, EARL DOOBLE and
          BUCK DOOBLE. They are chubby, thirty-year old twins -
          identical in every way, except for the fact that Buck is
          missing an ear on the right side of his head... which the
          skin has scarred back over. It doesn't look good.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Howdy, guys! Welcome to the block party!
          These are my deputies: Earl and Buck
          Dooble.
          Earl shakes the guys hands.

<b>                         EARL
</b>          I'm Earl and he's Buck. Just remember,
          the brother with the word "ear," in his
          name, has both on his head.

<b>                         (LAUGHS)
</b>          I can only say that because I'm on his
          right side. Which as you can see, is
          blown off.
          Earl laughs again, as BUCK extends his hand - oblivious.

</b>          I'm Buck and this is Earl. Good luck

          Buck laughs and turns to Charley, exposing his missing
          ear to the guys. They draw back a little.

<b>          ANGLE ON: DANCE FLOOR AREA:
</b>          DUDLEY is on the dance floor with MAGGIE. The middle
          aged guy on stage is letting loose with a rendition of
          Usher's "Yeah." Maggie and Dudley dance conservatively
          for a moment, but as the beat gets ahold of Dudley, he
          starts getting into it. He starts spinning around at a
          rapid pace, then drops to his knees, slaps the ground and
          shakes his head to the music.
          Maggie watches curiously as Dudley pulls himself along
          the ground by his elbows - then springs up to his feet
          and starts a move that resembles a sprinkler. Maggie
          grins - actually amused by Dudley's rhythmic passion.

          ANGLE ON: The Wild Hog's table. The guys sit with
          Charley, Buck and Earl - watching Dudley with a curious
          look.

<b>                         EARL
</b>          Yup. Big cans, too. Buck liked her, but
          you know... He's a deformed freak.
          Buck, on Earl's left, stares out at Maggie and Dudley,
          deaf to the conversation.

<b>                         BUCK
</b>          I used to like that girl... but then I
          realized, I can do better.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          I know what you mean. Sometimes things
          in life can bother you, and sometimes
          nothing in life can bother you. Either
          way, you've got take a break from it.
          Happiness is somewhere between boredom
          and stress.

</b>          Exactly. Which is why we need to keep
          riding until we figure out where that

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Yeah. Apparently I've lost him. I don't
          sing Bon Jovi anymore.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          You did lose him, Doug. You know why?
          You're housebroken. You're too
          comfortable. You've got to snap out of
          it!
          Doug nods halfheartedly. He knows woody might be right.

</b>
<b>                         (TO DOUG)
</b>          Woody's got a point, there. Comfortable
          can be a bad thing. You have to wake up
          and slap the bull once in a while.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Right! Slap the bull!
          (then, to Charley)
          What?

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Slapping the bull is kind of the local
          test of manhood. It's a way to prove you
          aren't controlled by fear. We've all
          done it.

<b>                         EARL
</b>          Yup. Even torn-open head, here.
          He nods at Buck, on his left.

<b>                         BUCK
</b>          You know, I slapped the bull once.
          Woody smiles slyly. Doug looks concerned.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          We're slapping the bull.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          I don't think we need to. I mean, we can
          have our own test of manhood. Let's see
          how many ears of corn we can eat or
          something. I'll start.
          Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite, but Woody
          just grins with that reckless look in his eyes.

          Charley gestures to a lone bull grazing in the pasture.
          He's a frighteningly large bull with enormous horns.

<b>                         EARL
</b>          Yup. Right on the ass. Then high-tail
          it out of there, because he can kill ya.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Wow. Um... Woody? This was your idea,
          so... go ahead.
          Woody nods.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          All right. I'm going in.

</b>          Hell yeah. I'm gonna slap the shit out
          of that bull. Like, pimp-style.
          The guys look at him, surprised and somewhat impressed.
          Woody takes a breath and climbs over the fence. He
          approaches the Bull very quietly and cautiously. He gets
          within three feet of it, leans in and slaps the Bull hard
          on the ass.
          The bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around, but
          Woody is already hightailing it back to the fence, with
          an exhilarated look on his face.

          pissed of a bull!

          Bitch!
          Woody high fives all the guys.

</b>          All right. I'm in. I'm slapping that
          bull.
          The guys cheer as Doug climbs over the fence and starts
          heading towards the Bull. The group all leans on the
          fence, watching.

          he's alert.

<b>                         WOODY / BOB

          Doug runs across the field, but the Bull - now fully
          alert - swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into
          an angry charge towards Doug.
          The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on
          Doug. Doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks
          back over his shoulder. His smile quickly turns to
          terror.

          It's too late. The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into
          the air. Doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on
          the muddy grass. The Bull takes a few steps back and
          starts lining up another charge at him.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Oh, no you don't!
          Woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field.

<b>                         WOODY (CONT'D)
</b>          Heeeeey! Hey you! Come get me, Bull!
          The Bull notices Woody and starts to Charge him.

<b>                         WOODY (CONT'D)
</b>          Run, Doug! Go!
          Doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging Woody.
          Woody realizes he's in trouble and starts to run again.
          The bull quickly catches him and rams him into the air.
          Woody lands hard, with a grunt.
          The bull turns back to charge at Woody again, and Bob
          jumps over the fence.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Hey! Leave him alone! You want some of
          this!? Come get this!
          Bob sprints out into the field. The bull snorts and
          starts towards him. The Bull closes on Bob quick, but at
          the last moment Bob dives of the way. The bull goes
          flying past him.

          Doug and Woody look impressed as Bob helps them hurry
          towards the fence. Charley and Buck hold a gate open for
          them as the Bull makes a turn and lines the group up, but
          they've already made it to the gate. They go through and
          Charley shuts it behind them. They lean back on the
          fence, trying to gather their bearings, except Bob - who
          is thrilled.

</b>          Did you see me? I dodged him! I dodged
          that stupid cow! How cool am--
          Suddenly, the Bull charges into the fence, which Bob's
          butt is sticking through. Bob goes flying and lands face
          down in the dirt. He scrambles back up, furious.

          going!? You want to take cheap shots!?
          Come on!
          Bob tries to climb back into the pasture, but the guys
          restrain him.

</b>          I'll kill you!
          Doug and Woody hold on to Bob until he calms down. Doug
          and Woody start to laugh. Bob cools off for another
          moment, then starts laughing as well.

</b>          No this is living!

          The group high fives each other in congratulations, and
          starts away: Bruised, muddy and laughing.
          ANGLE ON: THE BULL. He pushes on the gate that Charley
          was holding open. The gate swings open.
          ANGLE ON: WOODY, BOB and DOUG. They walk with Charley
          and the Dooble brothers, laughing and carrying on.

          Bob does an impression of how he dodged it and goes for
          some more high fives - but suddenly, the bull charges
          into frame and nails him. As Bob goes flying; we:

          The block party is winding down. Dudley is sitting by

          DOUG, WOODY and BOB approach, dirty and beaten from the

          and sees: THE HELLS ANGELS. All forty of them are
          riding into town - and the guys will be in their view any
          second. Woody is frozen with fear.

          DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY look confused. Woody looks around
          desperately for somewhere to hide - but the Hells Angels
          are too close. There's no time. Woody spots a port-o-
          potty from the block party and starts corralling Doug,

          The Hells Angels park their bikes. We see all the

          stand there, scared. Jack gets off his bike and looks
          around.

          Angels through a vent in the port-o-potty.

          too much for the port-o-potty...

          The port-o-potty tips over. All the Hells Angels turn
          and look as it crashes over on it's side. They continue
          to stare at it curiously.

          The guys, now on their side, freeze as they see through
          the vent that the Hells Angels are staring at them. It's
          a very tense moment as they wait to see if they've been
          discovered. After a moment, we hear a "glup, glup,
          glup," And the guys smell something curious.

</b>          I've lost everything. The firm fired me,
          Claudia left me... It's all gone. My
          whole life is gone. I don't even have
          enough money to get my lawn raked
          anymore.
          Doug, Bob and Dudley are stupefied. Woody takes a deep
          breath and continues.

<b>                         WOODY (CONT'D)
</b>          That's why I couldn't go back. This
          isn't a vacation for me, it's the only
          thing I have left. There's nothing more
          in my life but you guys. So, I lied
          about the Hells Angels. I lied because I
          wanted to have one thing in my life that
          wasn't a complete failure. A real trip
          with my best friends... You're all I
          got. I'm sorry.
          Woody lowers his head. The guys take this in for a
          minute. Woody looks at them, waiting for their sympathy.
          Finally, Doug speaks.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          (realizing, to Woody)
          This trip is just you running from your
          life. Your miserable, screwed up life.

<b>                         (GETTING ANGRIER)
</b>          And you knew you couldn't go back to it,
          so instead you screwed up our lives,
          too... You asshole!
          Woody's puppy-dog face dissolves.

</b>          Fine! I see how important I am to you
          guys. That's just fine. I just thought
          being a "Wild Hog" meant something!
          Woody takes off his "Wild Hogs" jacket and throws it at
          their feet. He hops out of the fountain and storms off
          down the street.

          Doug, Bob and Dudley look at each other. After a moment,
          they look over to the sidewalk and see:
          ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE, staring at them in disappointed
          silence. Slowly, the townspeople turn and quietly head
          back to their homes. Doug, Bob and Dudley lower their
          heads in disgrace. So much for being heroes.

          Doug wakes up on a cot in an open jail cell. He walks
          out of the cell, and over to the window.
          ANGLE ON: The Main Street Diner: The Hells Angels bikes
          are still parked outside, and the bikers appear to be
          passed out in various booths, chairs, and the street out
          front.
          BACK ON: The police station. Dudley and Bob approach

<b>                         BOB
</b>          So what? They can call the National

          bench. He watches all the children play, and his eyes
          fall on four young boys happily riding their bicycles

          around him, and sits.

          Woody eyes water a little and he quickly turns away from
          Doug. They sit there for another moment.

          Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Did you bring the paddles?

<b>                         WOODY

          thing out, but I didn't want you to think
          I was just standing at the lake waiting
          for you.

<b>                         DOUG

          Doug nods. Bob walks up on the shore, holding a
          styrofoam cup.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Hey, guys.

          Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods.

</b>
<b>                         (TO BOB)
</b>          Throw us that paddle.
          Bob nods and picks up a paddle. He throws it toward the
          canoe, but it lands ten yards short and sinks.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Shit. Hold on.

          Bob grabs another paddle and throws it. This time it
          lands even shorter. Bob looks around for another paddle.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Were those the only two paddles?

</b>          Oh.
          Bob sits down on the grass.

          Woody and Doug look around at the water. It's as still
          as glass. They sit there awkwardly as Bob waits on
          shore.

          A cook from the diner is at the kitchen stove, making
          something in a big pot, as a crowd of townspeople eat in
          the kitchen and dining room. MAGGIE and DUDLEY cross
          through the kitchen, and out to the front porch.

          just sorry you guys got dragged into it.
          You were just out to have a good
          vacation.
          Dudley looks at Maggie sincerely.

</b>          Maggie, I have to tell you something.
          I'm not really a cool biker or a cool...
          anything. I'm a computer programmer. A
          nerd. My cat doesn't even like me. She
          watches me sleep and I don't know why. I
          think she's waiting for me to stop
          breathing. I'm just a... Geek. I'm
          sorry if you thought I was somebody I'm
          not.
          Maggie takes this in. After a moment, she smiles and
          kisses Dudley.

<b>                         MAGGIE

          coolest guy I know. Your cat is crazy if
          it doesn't like you as much as I do.
          Dudley smiles. He has completely fallen for her.

          DUDLEY kicks open the front door. JACK and the other
          Hells Angels are inside, drinking and carrying on.

<b>                         DUDLEY
</b>          Alright, let's end this!
          The Hells Angels don't even notice him. Dudley bites his
          lip in frustration.

          Dudley takes a table full of empty beer glasses and flips
          it over. Everyone in the diner goes silent and looks at
          him. Jack stands up and smiles.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Well, well. One of you came to face the
          music, huh? That's brave. And stupid.
          The Hells Angels laugh. Dudley takes a deep breath and
          walks up to Jack.

<b>                         DUDLEY
</b>          I'm not here to face any music. I'm here
          to make you a deal. A deal I think you'd
          be smart to take.

</b>          Yeah? What deal?

</b>          You leave the town of Lucas, and my
          friends alone, and I do something for
          you. Something you can't live without.
          Jack looks interested. Dudley confidently sets a laptop
          on the counter, and punches a few keys. He swivels it
          around to show the gang.

          So they way I see it: I need a favor
          from you and you need a favor from me.
          Jack walks over to the computer and looks at Dudley for a
          moment. He then picks the computer up and smashes it
          down on the ground. It breaks into a hundred pieces.
          Jack smiles at Dudley and puts his foot through what's
          left of it. The Hells Angels stifle laughter. Dudley is
          starting to look a little nervous.

</b>          Okay, then. Thanks for hearing me out.
          Dudley starts for the door, but several Hells Angels move
          over and block his path. Dudley stops and collects
          himself for a moment - then breaks into a panicked sprint
          for the other exit. The Hells Angels quickly spring into
          action and tackle him to the ground.

          Charley hands it to him, and Doug starts to dial.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          He needed to call his answering machine
          so his cat could hear his voice.

<b>                         (TO MAGGIE)

          you some romantic gift or something. No
          big deal.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          That's it. He's never had a girlfriend
          so he's probably getting carried away.
          He once drank eighteen Mocha Latte's
          because the Starbucks clerk was smiling
          at him.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          I remember that. His pee turned brown
          and he started crying.

</b>          Yeah. And the girl wasn't even smiling -

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          It's not. But sometimes you have to do
          the things that aren't safe, to create a
          world that you're happy being in. These
          Hells Angels don't want our ten thousand
          dollars. They want our dignity. They
          want us to be afraid of them just like
          this town is. And once they know we're
          afraid, they can do whatever they want.
          That's how these guys exist. That's how
          they ride into this town and tear it to
          pieces... Because people want to keep
          their lives safe so badly, they give up
          the best part about it...

          They push DUDLEY forward. We see he is now completely
          cocooned in duct-tape - like a mummy. There is only a

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          We can still outrun them. They're fat.
          Woody turns around to see Hells Angles have now closed in
          behind them, blocking their escape. Jack smiles.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Hear that, guys!? He called you all fat!

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          shit.
          (to Hells Angels)
          I meant full-figured.
          The Hells Angels close to within a few feet of the "Wild
          Hogs," and raise their weapons to strike.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Wait!! Wait a minute!
          The Hells Angels stop.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>                         (TO JACK)
</b>          You want to beat the shit out of us?
          Fine. But you outnumber us forty to
          three. You think there's honor in that?
          Why don't we make it fair, if you guys
          are so freaking tough? The leader of our
          gang against the leader of yours.
          Jack smirks. He's twice as big as Doug.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Me against you?

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Yeah. But not just for Dudley. If you
          win, we'll give you ten grand and go back
          home. You'll never see us again. But...
          If I win, you let Dudley go and you never
          set foot in Lucas again. This town is
          off limits to the Hells Angels. Forever.

          Jack looks back to the Hells Angels, who chuckle. This
          will be a quick fight.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>          Well? You in, or are you too much of a
          bitch?
          The Hells Angels freeze. Jack grits his teeth in rage
          and turns back to Doug.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          All right. Let's party, tough guy.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Great.
          Doug nods, trying to look confidant, but it's quickly
          fading away.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)

          DOUG and JACK are standing "in their corners," opposite
          each other in the dirt parking lot. They're surrounded
          by a circle of Hells Angels, rowdily waiting for the
          fight to commence. WOODY and BOB coach Doug in his
          corner.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Just stay clear of the big punches.
          You've got more stamina than this guy.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          All right. When do I hit back?

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Um... Just try and get him tired. I
          don't think punches will do much to him.
          Doug gives Woody a concerned look. Woody shrugs. Jack
          steps into the circle and throws off his jacket.

          Doug takes a deep breath and starts into the circle.

</b>
<b>                         (TO JACK)
</b>          All right. Let's do this--
          Doug doesn't even finish his sentence as Jack lands a
          punch on the side of his head. Doug is stunned, as Jack
          sends his other fist crashing into Doug's forehead. Doug
          goes flying backwards, and falls down in the dirt. The
          Hells Angels cheer. Jack high fives them as Doug
          struggles back to his feet and looks back at Woody and
          Bob, cradling his face.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>          Ow! Dammit Jesus that hurt!

<b>                         (TO WOODY)
</b>          It really hurts. Damn!
          Jack comes back over to Doug. Jack throws another right,
          but this time Doug ducks, still cradling his jaw.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>          Yes!--
          But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jack's
          other fist. Doug winces as he doubles over in agony.
          Drool drips out of his mouth. This isn't pretty.
          Jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him
          into the air. The Hells Angels cheer as Jack tosses Doug
          five yards into the dirt.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Don't get tired yet. The hurt is just
          beginning.
          Doug tries to stand back up, but it's getting harder. He
          slyly grabs a handful of sand as he starts to stand.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Hah!
          Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jack's
          face; However, his aim is off. The sand hits Jack in the
          chest and falls away. Jack looks at Doug and shakes his
          head.

</b>          Damn.
          Jack punches Doug square in the face again. Doug
          crumples to the ground in pain. Jack turns back to the
          Hells Angels.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Man, this isn't even a workout.
          Jack laughs and puts his aviator sunglasses back on, as
          Doug quickly stands up and whips around at him.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Ahhh!
          Doug throws another handful of sand. This time he aims
          carefully; but Jack now has sunglasses on. The sand
          bounces harmlessly off the lenses. Doug cringes and
          waits for the punch, which comes like a freight train
          into his stomach. Doug doubles over again as Jack lines
          up another punch.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          This one's gonna break bone.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Wait! Wait--
          Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jack's mouth.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>          Your tooth-- That's an acute periodontal

</b>          look, I really hate you, but I don't want
          to feel responsible for a death. I'm a
          dentist. I took an oath. Same one as

          gets to the root - it could seep into

          Doug slowly reaches towards Jack's mouth. Jack doesn't
          move.

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         DOUG

          your gums are that swollen and your

<b>                         BICUSPID--
</b>          And Wham! Doug punches Jack square in the mouth. Jack
          goes down hard. Woody and Bob cheer.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Yeah, Doug!

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Quick! Start kicking him! Don't let him
          get up!
          Doug nods and goes to kick Jack, but Jack grabs the foot
          and pushes him backwards. Doug falls back to the dirt.
          Jack stands up and dusts himself off.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          All right. Now you're going to die.
          Jack approaches Doug, who closes his eyes and waits for
          the end.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Wait!!
          Jack turns around as WOODY walks into the circle.

<b>                         WOODY (CONT'D)
</b>          Doug's not the leader of this gang. I--
          Jack instantly punches Woody in the face. Woody falls
          down next to Doug. Doug turns his head to Woody.
          They're both bleeding from their noses and lips.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>

</b>          Thanks, man.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          Sure.
          Jack looks at Bob.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Anybody else the leader of this gang?
          Bob takes a deep breath, and bends down an grabs a long
          lead pipe. He starts towards Jack.

          Bob suddenly trips on the lead pipe and hits the ground.
          Doug shakes his head.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>
<b>                         (TO BOB)

          Bob nods.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Well, I guess that's all of you--
          DUDLEY, still covered in tape, comes running into the
          circle from the other side.

<b>                         DUDLEY
</b>          Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
          Dudley charges Jack, but his limited mobility results not
          in a tackle, but in him leaning on Jack. After a moment,
          Jack takes a step back and Dudley falls to the ground.

<b>                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Give me the crowbar.
          Oilcan nods and hands it to Jack. Jack smiles at the
          four fallen Wild Hogs.

<b>                         SFX: SIREN

          ANGLE ON: DOWN STREET. CHARLEY is riding his shiny
          Harley Davidson police bike. Behind him are BUCK and
          EARL, driving a police cruiser. Behind the cruiser is a
          large group of people carrying rakes, hedge clippers,
          brooms... It's all the citizens of Lucas.
          ANGLE ON: Hells Angels. They're stunned.

          motorcycle.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          All right, Jack. That'll be enough of
          that.

<b>                         JACK

          our permission?

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          I'll ride whatever I want from now on.
          I'm the sheriff of Lucas, and I'm not
          tolerating any more lawlessness.
          BOB helps DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY to their feet, as Jack
          takes a step towards Charley.

<b>                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)

          Earl and Buck get out of the cruiser with two shotguns.
          They cock the guns and walk to Charley's side. Jack
          looks concerned.

</b>          No. Not unless you want to do something
          stupid like ignoring--
          Buck grabs his missing ear as he starts to loose his
          balance. He tips over and falls. As he hits the ground,
          the shotgun fires and hits OILCAN in the leg. Oilcan
          falls to the ground.

<b>                         OILCAN

</b>          Um... Yeah, I guess we're going to shoot
          you.
          The Hells Angels suddenly look nervous, and back up a few
          steps. Charley steps towards Jack.

          out as a child molester, steps forward.

<b>                         THOMAS MILBORN
</b>          Yeah! People like you are the scum of

          The crowd is silent for a moment, then hesitantly gives a
          uncomfortable cheer. Charley turns back to the Hells
          Angels.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          The point is, from now on you need to

          And when you do, you'll be treated the
          same. And if you don't...
          Charley looks over at OILCAN, who's tending to the bullet
          wound in his thigh.

          Jack looks at all the townspeople. He knows he's beaten.
          He nods bitterly.

<b>                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Good. Now I'd like you to untape our
          friend Dudley.
          Jack signals to one of the Hells Angels. He grabs
          Dudley's tape and spins him around to untape him.

<b>                         DUDLEY

          After a painful minute, Dudley is untaped. Charley looks
          at Jack's jacket.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          And I believe that's his jacket.
          Jack begrudgingly takes off Dudley's "Wild Hogs" jacket
          and tosses it to him. Dudley proudly puts it on.

<b>                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          And as I recall, that '51 Panhead was
          traded to Dudley.
          Jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and
          shakes his head.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          No way. He can have his Sportster back.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Uh uh. A deal's a deal, Jack.
          Jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at Dudley.
          The crowd chatters in approval as Dudley gets on the '51
          Panhead and starts the engine. He revs it a few times
          and Jack shoots Doug an infuriated glare.

<b>                         JACK
</b>
<b>                         (TO DOUG)
</b>          Hope you're happy. You suburban posers
          are a disease. You need to learn some
          damn respect for real bikers.
          Doug smiles.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          You still don't get it do you, Jack?

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Get what?

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          We are the real bikers.
          As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and
          shoots forward - out of control. He instantly crashes
          into a steel light post. Everyone in the crowd cringes

<b>                         DUDLEY LOOKS
</b>          as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap.
          up from the ground.

<b>                         DUDLEY
</b>          Yeah, I'll take the Sportster back, I
          guess.

          Jack just stares at the trashed motorcycle, mortified.

          It's later that afternoon in Lucas. DOUG, BOB and WOODY
          walk to their motorcycles with CHARLEY, EARL and BUCK.

<b>                         CHARLEY
</b>          Well, I wish you guys would stay longer.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Ahh, we should be heading back. I think
          we've had enough excitement for one trip.
          Earl steps forward and shakes Doug's hand.

<b>                         EARL
</b>          You guys were a blessing to this place.
          I mean... I'm not going to get all
          emotional like "hamburger head" here
          always does.
          Earl laughs and looks to his left. Buck isn't there. He
          quickly looks to the right, where Buck is staring at him
          in disbelief.

<b>                         BUCK
</b>          What'd you just call me?

<b>                         EARL

</b>          It's just a little scar! I'm still
          better looking than you!
          Buck goes to storm off, but after a few steps, tilts left
          and falls over.

          Doug shakes his head, then turns to Woody and Bob.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          (to Woody and Bob)
          You guys ready to head back?

          Woody takes a deep breath and shakes his head.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>          You know what? I think I'm going to
          press on. Keep heading West.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          You are?

</b>          Yeah. Why not? I feel good about my
          life again. And I'd like to see what San
          Francisco's all about.
          Doug nods and looks to Bob. You can tell he wants to go.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          I'm in, too! Let's ride to San--
          Suddenly, a mini-van pulls up. KAREN and KELLY hop out.

<b>                          BOB / DOUG
</b>          Karen? / Kelly?

          Kelly kisses Doug. He smiles, glad to see her.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Hey, baby. What are you doing here?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          Karen said you guys were in trouble. I
          kept calling your cell, but somebody
          programmed it to not receive calls from
          our house.
          Doug shoots Woody a look.

<b>                         WOODY
</b>

          Woody hurries over to his bike. KAREN turns to BOB.

          Now get in the van. We're going home.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          Um... Actually, we just decided we were
          going to keep pressing West for a few--

<b>                         KAREN
</b>          Oh, no. No way! I came all the way out
          here, rented a car, drove to this podunk

<b>                         LITTLE TOWN--
</b>          As Karen is saying this, Bob looks over at the guys, then
          back to Karen. He can't take it anymore.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          --Karen!
          Karen stops talking, shocked by Bob raising his voice.

<b>                         BOB (CONT'D)
</b>          Listen to me. This is My vacation and if
          I want to ride on with my friends, well
          that's what I'm going to do! And if you
          have a problem with that, well... Tough
          shit!
          There's a moment of silence as Karen absorbs this. The
          guys all look at Bob proudly. After a few seconds,
          Karen's face softens.

<b>                         KAREN

          Karen shyly kisses Bob on the cheek. Bob can't believe
          it.

<b>                         BOB
</b>          I will. And... I love you.
          Bob smiles at her and gets on his bike.
          ANGLE ON: DOUG and KELLY. Kelly looks at Doug.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          So are you going, too?

<b>                         DOUG

          Doug winks cockily. Kelly lights up.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          There he is! I saw old Doug!
          Doug blushes.

</b>          You'll see him even more if you and Billy
          meet me in San Francisco. We've got a
          suite at the Ritz-Carlton.
          Doug smiles and gets onto his motorcycle. Kelly looks
          concerned.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>          What about work? And Billy's school?
          Doug shrugs like he hasn't a care in the world.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>          Ahh. We can risk it.
          Kelly smiles and kisses him proudly. Doug grabs her face
          and kisses her back... Then, turns to Woody and Bob.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)

          The camera PULLS OUT to reveal DUDLEY, sitting on his
          motorcycle. Next to him, is MAGGIE, sitting in the rusty
          sidecar now attached to Dudley's bike. She's wearing
          Dudley's goggles and nods to him encouragingly. Dudley
          looks back over to Doug, Bob and Woody.

          The four motorcycles (and one sidecar) cruise down the
          open highway. The guys smile as the wind blows in their
          faces.

          It's freedom, joy and friendship all wrapped up in one
          expression. The camera PANS AROUND THEM, and finally
          ZOOMS IN ON DOUG. We see his eyes sparkle a little bit,
          and he opens his mouth:
