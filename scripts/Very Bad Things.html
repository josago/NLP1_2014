               Pitch black. Dead quiet. Dim faint light appears in the 
               distance, approaching, growing larger. As the light nears, 
               we recognize car headlights. Closer and closer until the car 
               is bearing down upon us with great force...

               Two men in the front seat, FISHER and MOORE. Fisher drives. 
               All seems quite normal until we take a closer look, sweat 
               matts hair, dirt stains on white tuxedo shirts hands are 
               blistered and bloody. They seem almost entranced.

               SLOWLY TRACKING down a long line of couples. Some with kids, 
               some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick 
               up their marriage license.

               We HOLD on a young couple, late 20's, KEITH FISHER and his 
               fiancee, LIZ GARRETY. Fisher has a blondish quality to him, 
               unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he 
               could be. Liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and 
               not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow 
               moving line.

               Ralph sees Tina.

               RALPH, in shock, staring, back-peddles...

               ON BOYD -- his Boy Scout knife raised above his head -- 
               driving it into Ralph's neck!

               MAJOR ARTERIAL SPRAY as Ralph's jugular is severed. Ralph 
               struggles. Boyd wrestles him back toward the bathroom.

                         carpet!

               And MOORE is there. Helping Boyd wrestle the SCREAMING 
               thrashing Ralph into the bathroom. Ralph fights like a gilled 
               Marlin. They shove him into the bathroom. Boyd slams the 
               door shut. Holds it tight as Ralph tries to force it back 
               open.

                         Help me hold the door.

               And help they do. Michael, Moore and Adam all hold the door 
               shut as Ralph continues to fight for his life. Slowly the 
               force of his POUNDING eases. We hear Ralph slowing down... 
               The thrashing slows... softer... The MOANS quiet... softer... 
               Just a slight GURGLE... Ralph is going... going... Ralph is 
               gone.

               Eight hands slowly peel off the bathroom door. Devastating 
               SILENCE as the guys attempt to process this, the latest of 
               developments... with Fisher staring, blotto.

<b>               INT. THE BATHROOM

               The door slowly opens. Boyd first -- then the rest of the 
               guy's heads slowly appear in the doorway.

               And Moore is out the door, racing for a garbage can to relieve 
               himself.

<b>               THE GUYS' POV
</b>
               An absolute blood bath. The walls are covered with Ralph's 
               arterial spray. Tina lies, still dead on her side. Ralph has 
               somehow "assumed the position" dead, head in the bathtub. A 
               bizarre and gruesome sight. Boyd surveys the carnage, takes 
               charge.

                         All right people. New plan. Not even 
                         a new plan so much as a modification 
                         of the old plan.

                         Surrender is no longer an option. I 
                         repeat -- It is not an option. Is 
                         there anyone who does not understand 
                         that?

               Fisher's response is to join Moore, as he searches for a 
               garbage can to puke in. Michael just stares.

               Moore and Fisher scrub blood from the carpet. Fisher keeps 
               forgetting to breath.

               Michael and Boyd put Tina and Ralph in the bath tub.

               Adam sits in shock on the floor.

               Fisher and Moore try to fix a broken chair.

               Boyd starts to dismember Ralph with the pruning shears, like 
               cutting the joints of a roasted chicken.

               Adam stares at the wall.

               Michael wraps one of Ralph's feet in plastic, puts it in a 
               suitcase.

               Boyd saws. Michael wraps. Fisher and Moore clean.

               Adam slowly straightens up a lamp, begins to help.

               UNTIL -- the last of the body parts, Tina's head, is wrapped 
               in plastic, packed in a suitcase.

               The bathroom has been remarkably cleaned up. Just a bit of 
               blood left in the tub. Boyd looks pleased.

               A black sedan, looking like an unmarked police car, pulls up 
               nose-to-nose with them at the pump. TWO MEN in dark suits in

                         Evidently, when they were in camp,

                         arguments over exactly who was Keith's 
                         best friend -- Boyd or the mule.

               A MEDICAL TEAM rushes into the room. Adam is a v-tach -- 
               Heart's not beating. The team injects medicine, defribulates. 
               Lois watches in horror as her husband dies in front of her...

</b>                         I don't see how this could have been 
                         kept from you. The facts are quite 
                         simple; last month Adam and Lois 
                         changed their will. They requested 
                         that you two, as a married couple, 
                         be the Custodians of Record for their 
                         estate including all properties, 
                         cash holdings, security holdings 
                         and... children. You are legal 
                         custodians of the Brenn Trust.

<b>               ANGLE ON
</b>
               Liz and Fisher, flanked by Adam Jr. and Timmy, eyes wide, 
               they sit across from the attorney, totally bazooka'd. They 
               stare in horror at Morris.

</b>                         More?

<b>                                     BARRY MORRIS
</b>                         Adam and Lois were not terribly 
                         prudent in terms of providing for 
                         the possibility of the unforeseen.

</b>                         What are you talking about?

<b>                                     BARRY MORRIS
</b>                         I'm talking about Life insurance. 
                         I'm talking about money.

</b>                         Yes money. Adam had a five hundred 
                         thousand dollar Term Life Insurance 
                         Policy.

<b>               PAUSE.

</b>                         What does that mean?

</b>                         That means we get five hundred 
                         thousand to help raise the kids.

                         No.

<b>                                     FISHER
</b>                         Yes.

<b>                                     BARRY MORRIS
</b>                         Actually, no. Adam was switching to 
                         a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled 
                         his medical exam... and failed to 
                         make his last payment... so his Term 
                         Life lapsed. So it's value is null 
                         and void.
                              (off Liz's horror)
                         Now he did have a pension account, 
                         worth another 150 thousand.

</b>                         So where's that leave us?

<b>                                     FISHER
</b>                         150 plus 350... we still get 500 
                         thousand.

                         No. Not even close. With property 
                         values down, the house is worth 
                         100,000 less than 450 he paid for 
                         it. With three credit cards, the 
                         minivan payments, and other 
                         outstanding debts... Plus the Income 
                         and Estate Taxes assessed on his 
<b>                         IRA...

                         You'll get, oh... in the neighborhood 
                         of, ah... 14,223 dollars.

               Adam Jr. suddenly slips off his chair, lands flat on his 
               back, starts struggling to get up. Fisher tries to help Little 
               Adam up.

               Fisher manages to get Adam Jr. back up in his chair. Liz 
               looks rather horrified.

<b>               INT. CAR
</b>
               Fisher drives, Liz up front, Adam jr. and Timmy in the back. 
               Everyone is shocked in silence. Fisher looks deathly ill, 
               like he's about to vomit. He pulls the car over and gets 
               out.

<b>               EXT. FISHER'S CAR
</b>
               Fisher leans on the trunk, puking. Liz gets out to help him, 
               he starts crying. Liz is gentle and loving.

</b>                         No it's not okay. It's not.

               The kids watch from the rear view window but can't hear.

               Boyd and fisher fight like animals; choking, pounding, 
               mauling, a fight to the death. Fisher is losing, Boyd is 
               choking the life out of him, killing him. Fisher is going 
               down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until...

               CRASH. Boyd's head is caved in from behind. REVEAL Liz 
               wielding a big, heavy crucifix. Boyd slumps to the ground. 
               Fisher gasps for air. Boyd stirs. Liz beats him repeatedly 
               with the crucifix until he's dead as a door knob. Fisher is 
               stunned. Liz tosses the cross. Miraculously, only one perfect 
               droplet of blood has gotten on her wedding dress. She flicks 
               it off with her finger.

               Before Moore can ask, the ORGAN begins playing the WEDDING 
               MARCH. Liz starts down the aisle, escorted by her father, 
               She smiles radiantly.

               Liz's father kisses her and gives her to Fisher. They stand 
               before the Judge who starts talking. TIGHT ON Fisher. His 
               head pounding. He hears none of what the Judge says until...

               He hands the rings to the Judge, at which time, he, she, 
               Fisher and Liz all see blood on his white shirt cuff. The 
               Judge looks at Moore. He pulls his jacket sleeve down.

                         life trying to start a company, 
                         practiced every day, worked like a

                         paid the dues, he's ready, does all

</b>                         That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie 
                         treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's 
                         figured it out. There is a hole in 
                         the market and he's going to fill

                         himself into not two but three heart 
                         attacks getting this shit up. After 
                         fifteen months, the big day arrives, 
                         the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off 
                         the belt. He comes running home with 
                         that box, pulls us out of school. We 
                         all pile into the living room, must 
                         be fifty of us, and in comes 
                         "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here 
                         Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got 
                         that little fucking pup corn in his 
                         hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat 
                         anything, she eats rocks, anything. 
                         She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks 
                         down at the little pellet, licks it 
                         once, turns around, walks out of the 
                         room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." 
                         Fifteen months of my dad's life, 
                         right there. Not one dog ate Pup 
                         Corn. Not one. Three months later, 
                         "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. 
                         My father never got over it. Never.

               SILENCE hangs again.
