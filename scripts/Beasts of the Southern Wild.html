          An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall
          oil drums. Distant thunder trembles through the peeling
          metal panels. The structure is in such disrepair, that
          surely no one lives here.
                         
          But then, a light goes on.

          A tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed
          on the floor. We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a
          baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an
          unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of
          unmistakable wisdom.
                         
          Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen
          on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice.
          Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by
          DISTANT THUNDER. Her eyes stand to attention.

          An eerie, harsh wind whips hay and dust through over a giant
          slumbering pot-belly pig.
                         
          Hushpuppy, donned in boys' underpants and a child-sized wife-
          beater, tip-toes behind the epic creature. She studies it,
          wonderful, is this the source of the thunder?
                         
          With the utmost delicacy, she lays a hand on the pig's belly.

          A series of glimpses of Hushpuppy's scientific method. She
          chases geese, chickens, ducks, dogs around the property- a
          cross between an abandoned farm and salvage yard.
                         
          Hushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear. A TINY
          HEARTBEAT. She listens with focused wonder and intensity.

           A window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson
           Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris
           and discarded appliances.
                         
           A wild man with severe features, a frazz of unkempt hair, and
           brawler's scars opens a window made from a metal sign. This
           is WINDELL EMMETT DOUCET, known to all as WINK (39).

           Wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into
           a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched 15

           Hushpuppy devours the whole roast chicken with her hands,
           getting right in there like it was a candy apple. It looks
           really yummy.
                         
           Pigs, dogs, chickens, and cats are chowing down all around

           A hatch opens above her and we realize we're in the bottom of
           the Shacko. Wink sticks his head through the hatch and throws
           corn to the chickens.

           Hushpuppy rips off a piece of chicken and flings it to a
           filthy chihuahua with no hair on the back half of its body.
           This is WINDELL, in spite of her circumstances, quite a

           WIDE, we see Hushpuppy and Wink drift through the marsh.
           They ride in a severed truck bed floating on top of oil
           drums. A motor is strapped to the back. A sign on the boat
           reads "The Turck", Hushpuppy's spelling of "Truck".
                         
           They look out to where the water goes all the way to a
           monolithic, 20 foot wall stretching infinitely into the
           distance. This levee, the first piece of modern construction
           we've seen, encloses the civilized world, protecting it from
           rising water. The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall.
                         
           Wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with
           a peaceful and confident disdain.
                         
           Hushuppy matches his relaxed defiant expression.

           endless sprawl of oil processing power plants without a tree
           or bird in sight. This is the engine that runs the Northern

           They stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both

           WHOOPING and SHOUTING.
                         
           Hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign. "Isle de
           Charles Doucet" is crossed out and someone has graffitied
           "The Bathtub." Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppy's kiss and

           trails of beer cans, boat parts, anything they can tie to
           themselves that makes a lot of noise.
                         
           They are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives,
           downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them, a
           community of heart, spirit, passion, and reckless abandon.
                         
           We see none of the separations that we're used to in modern
           society. There is no evidence of politics, religion, class,
           race or any other divisive ideology. The Bathtub is a place
           of true and honest unity.
                         
           Megaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the Cajun
           band playing inside. Fiddle, saw, guitar, and double-bass
           players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck
           bounces them down a dirt road.

           metal plates, and heavy chains. Carnival-dressed maniacs
           clamber on top.

           Explosions everywhere as Bathtubers rampage blasting
           fireworks down the street instead of into the air. Men
           dressed as women, women dressed as men, in some kind of
           reckless esoteric ritual.
                         
           The SCORE kicks in hard with a tinge of ominous forboding.

           and they watch her rocket join a sky filled with pluming
           mortars.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks at the light flickering across Wink's faces.
           He's momentarily peaceful, admiring the spectacular display.
                         
           Hushpuppy smiles at him with pride. He doesn't see her.
                         
           They run off into the crowd, which is pulsating at the
           pinnacle of mayhem. The OMINOUS MUSIC shifts gears into a

           One of them has been skewered by a beetle and is fighting for

           A single ice cube takes over the frame and the mammoth dead

           Wink slowly navigates the Turck in through the flooded
           landscape where their town had once been. Neither he nor

           organism is dead or has fled. The quiet is overwhelming.

           More striking than the ripped-up houses, the land surrounding

           They try to kick toward the light but are getting nowhere,
           the current pulls them backwards.
                         
           We hear a BOAT HORN and they look to where an ANCIENT TUG
           BOAT with a cabin that towers into the sky like a giraffe
           head, appears through the mist.

           The girls climb aboard, lifting each other onto the deck.
                         
           They look up to the sound of FOOTSTEPS on the upper deck.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks up to see SERGEANT MAJOR (60) -
                         
           A big, timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache,
           saunters up to the rail. He stares down, examining these
           runts with an air of suspicion.

           He smiles broadly, as if this was the secret password. Him
           and Hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is
           understanding. Two lost souls in the wilderness.
                         
<b>                          SERGEANT MAJOR

           Hushpuppy sits adjacent to the Sergeant in the tug's elevated
           wheelhouse. They are two stories up, and the white walls
           create a glow that makes us feel like we're almost in another
           dimension.
                         
<b>                          HUSHPUPPY

           Hushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else
           we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with. The speak like an old
           teacher with his favorite disciple. They let their silences
           last.

</b>           They're good for you.
                         
           A deep, far away melancholy settles over him. He munches on
           a chicken biscuit, then tosses the wrapper on the floor. The
           wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers.
                         
<b>           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)
</b>           I been eating these all my life. I
           keep the wrappers in the boat,

           chair back toward the water

           The beacon appears through the mist. Hushpuppy's eyes go
           wide.
                         
           As they approach, another boat comes into view. A half-
           sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the
           same position for a century. As we move in we see a lit up
           sign: "Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack GIRLS GIRLS

</b>                         
           Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge
           with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a
           hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away
           JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to
           each other in wonder.
                         
                         
<b>           INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>                         
           Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland.
           Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke
           facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at
           a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans
           Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their
           ladies of the night.
                         
           There is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along
           with "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Fats Waller.
                         
           The hyperactive MISS FRANKIE, the matriarch of this

           Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do
           with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists.
                         
           Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry
           of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They
           are not who she is looking for.
                         
           She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up
           all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it,
           none of them right.
                         
           Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes,
           ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious
           dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed.
                         
           She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen.
                         
           Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven.
                         
           SLOW MOTION: in Hushpuppy's POV, smoke curls through the
           swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles.
           It's a magic kitchen. Her POV tilts down to the floor where
           a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the
           swinging doors. They open.
                         
           Hushpuppy holds her breath.
                         
           A gorgeous COOK (35) wearing a baseball cap and an apron
           comes out the double doors. She wipes some sweat off her
           brow. She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold
           beer.
                         
           The Cook looks down. Sees Hushpuppy.

           Hushpuppy nods, holding her breath. She still can't speak.
                         
<b>                          COOK (CONT'D)

           Hushpuppy shrugs.
                         
           She's too stunned, too shy to speak.

           The Cook takes stock of the helpless creature in front of
           her. Like a butcher shop owner with a pesky hungry puppy,
           she submits to Hushpuppy's longing gaze.

           Hushpuppy follows her into the magic kitchen, knocking her
           head against the swinging doors on her way in.

           With the smooth fanfare of a circus performer, The Cook lifts
           an egg, opens a beer bottle with her teeth, SPITS the cap at
           the egg and it cracks over the grits.
                         
           Hushpuppy's face is joy beyond all measure. She watches the
           Cook's flying hands, she prepares everything in a single
           motion, it's like a dance. She slaps a fresh alligator tail
           on the table and begins sawing through the scales.

           She removes the knife from the gator and aims it at Hushpuppy
           like its a pointer.

           in front of Hushpuppy. Lemon is squeezed all over

           Hushpuppy tries to crack a grin. She barely remembers how to
           smile and it comes out all wrong. The Cook shakes her head,
           opens another beer on her teeth, and heads for the pantry.

           and tender. This seems to be the M.O of this strip club,

           in his arm. Baby Hushpuppy stares up at him as he carries

           not hugging back, just being held.

           Hushpuppy cups her hand to the Cook's ear and whispers
           something inaudible.
                         
           The Cook squeezes her tight, seeming on the verge of adopting
           her. But she can't. She spins Hushpuppy around and around,
           then puts her down withouth meeting her gaze.
                         
           Hushpuppy watches her disappear into the crowd of swaying
           couples.

           audible.

           Behind Hushpuppy the dark shapes of the Aurochs crest the

           scream and sprint out in front of Hushpuppy.
                         
           Hushpuppy walks steadily forward, refusing to run. Her face
           locked with determination, she is unafraid. Her eyes shoot

           Hushpuppy balls her fists and stands her ground. Suddenly,
           she turns.
                         
           The Aurochs ROARS. Then, inches away from Hushpuppy, she
           stops. She SNORTS, blowing Hushpuppy's hair back. Hushpuppy
           doesn't flinch.
                         
           The Aurochs stares face to face with Hushpuppy. Sniffs.

           Now in full profile, we see the Aurochs towering 15-feet
           tall, she takes a step forwards, sniffs again. A low SNORT,
           or is it a purr?
                         
           The Aurochs lowers her head with respect.
                         
           Her eyes well with emotion, recognizing one of her own. A
           ferocious warrior.
                         
           The Aurochs steps back, takes a knee, and with a BELLY FLOP
           that rattles the very earth, she lays down. Her three
           companions follow suit, their fat tummies settling into an
           almost joyful, lazy, repass.
                         
           A strange calm has settled over Hushpuppy. Almost a smile,
           but more of a peace and an affection for her equal. They're
           both children in their way.

           sits on his bed.
                         
           Hushpuppy takes her to-go container from Elysian Fields out
           of a paper bag and pops it. She unwraps a gator nugget, dips
           it in hot sauce, and holds it out for Wink to take a bite.
                         
           Hushpuppy watches as Wink chews weakly. She eats one
           herself.
                         
           Wink and Hushpuppy draw it out. They don't want it to end.

           We CUT WIDE to reveal that the water is rising and washing
           over the road. Our heroes are marching on the final sliver
           of land. The camera flies backwards, and our view of the
           road disappears into mist and churning waves. They appear to
           be walking on water.
                         
           Hushpuppy leads them forward, into the future.
