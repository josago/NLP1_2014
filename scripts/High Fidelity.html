                         thousands -- of songs about broken 
                         hearts and rejection and pain and 
                         misery and loss.

               It seems the records, tapes, and CD's will never end until...  
               we come to ROB -- always a hair out of place, a face that

               addresses us, the wall of music behind him.

               Group of bags huddled next to the door.  Not the go-on-

               vacation set, but the clothes-to-coffee-maker moving out 
               variety.  Rob stares at them, his face unreadable, his head 
               gripped by a big pair Boudokan headphones.  We hear what he 
               is hearing, something foreboding and upbeat at the same time.

               LAURA, Rob's girlfriend, enters the room, and he immediately 
               pulls the headphones off.  She clocks him for a moment, 
               catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment 
               of nonpresence.  She begins to heft the bags, Rob goes to 
               her, a little tardy for his big goodbye.  Laura begins to 
               cry a bit.

               He smiles, and she doesn't.  He adjusts.

               Laura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs 
               out the door.  A strap catches on a handle and the two of 
               them wrestle with it a bit, while trying to keep the door 
               open, until Laura awkwardly disappears from view and the 
               door shuts behind Rob.  He stays right there staring at the 
               shut door for a long moment, listening to the fading sound 
               of Laura and her dragging bags.

               Rob moves around the apartment, seeming to expand physically, 
               looking for change as he continues.

                         Can you see your name in that list, 
                         Laura?  Maybe you'd sneak into the

                         you in the top five.  Sorry.  Those 
                         places are reserved for the kind of 
                         humiliations and heartbreaks that 
                         you're just not capable of delivering.

               He adjusts the angle of the TV, stuffs a creepy family 
               portrait into a drawer.

                         it's meant to, but the fact is, we're 
                         too old to take each other miserable.  
                         Unhappiness used to mean something.  
                         Now it's just a drag like a cold or 
                         having no money.

               He moves through the living room to an open window facing 
               the street.  Looking down two stories, he sees Laura emerge 
               from the building and drag her bags toward her car across 
               the street.

               consciousness and humiliation and attempts to affect a casual 
               gait as he mopes away.

                         I was fourteen, times have changed, 
                         relationships have become more 
                         sophisticated, females less cruel, 
                         skins thicker, but there still seems 
                         to be an element of that afternoon 
                         in everything that has happened to 
                         me since.  All my other romantic 
                         stories seem to be a scrambled version

               have a new idea, and dives south to follow the thigh into

               if there weren't so many record-release posters taped to 
               them.  A dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug.  
               On the walls are bagged 45's you will never hear unless you 
               commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to 
               every noodling of Jah Wobble and Glen Glenn and other people 
               you've never heard of.

               But as Rob opens the door, enters, and flips a switch causing 
               the fluorescents to sputter, we see in his eyes the reverence 
               and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty 
               field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church.

               As he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back, he 
               stops on a dime, steps back and pulls a CD from the sea and

               replaces it almost the same position, but not quite --
               meticulousness and pride in this gesture...

               After a moment the door creaks open behind Rob, admitting 
               DICK, a nervous, forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile 
               with long greasy black hair, a Sonic Youth T-shirt, a 
               monstrous pair of headphones, and a canvas record bag 
               emblazoned with a label logo.

<b>               INT. RECORD STORE - LATER

               Dick is behind the counter, Rob in the aisles with a clipboard 
               doing inventory.

<b>                                     ROB
</b>                              (re: music)

</b>                         The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like 
                         it?

               The door flies open and BARRY, an acid-tongued post-punk 
               rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to 
               conceptualize his own rebellion, walks in.  His teeth are 
               clenched in air-guitar concentration and he's phonetically 
               cranking a Clash riff:

<b>                                     BARRY
</b><b>                         BAA!  BA BA DANG!
</b>
               Dick shrinks back from him instinctively.  He stops mid-step 
               and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store.  His 
               face adopts an exaggerated grimace.

<b>                                     BARRY

</b>                         It's the new --

</b>                         It's the record we've been listening 
                         to and enjoying, Barry.

               Barry moves in on the stereo behind the counter, and Dick 
               gets out of his way.

<b>                                     BARRY
</b>                         Well that's problematic because it 
                         sucks ass.

               He pops the CD out and frisbees it to Dick.

<b>                                     BARRY

                         Yours, I assume...

               Barry pulls a tape out of his jacket and jams it in.  "How 
               to Kill a Radio Consultant" by Public Enemy comes through at 
               through the red levels.

<b>                                     ROB

               Barry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and disappears.

               Rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape.  Barry's 
               head pops out of the stockroom.

               Barry bristles and moves slowly in on Dick.

                         you know, a conversation stimulator.

</b>                         Well what's the point in that?

               From outside.  HEAR THE SOUND OF SKATEBOARD WHEELS CLACKING 
               AND SCRAPING, GETTING LOUDER.  Rob, Dick and Barry stop 
               fighting to listen, then each moves purposefully to a spot 
               in the store.  Dick to the register, Barry to the back, Rob 
               next to the door, as if bracing for a street fight.

               The SOUND gets closer, then stops.  The door swings open to 
               admit VINCE and JUSTIN, two fifteen-year-old skate punks.

               Vince's hair is post-apocolyptically hacked to different 
               lengths, Justin's in uniformly shaven with leopard spots 
               dyed browse.  Rob follows them, watching their every move.

               Dick counters from his perch, getting another angle.  Barry 
               cracks his knuckles threateningly.  Vince and Justin do their 
               best browser impersonations.  Finally Justin plucks a CD, 
               and the two move to the counter.

               Vince reaches into his deep pocket and pulls out a paper 
               cup, with piece of paper attached that says "Please help me.  
               I'm retarded."  He pours a mass of change and crumpled singles 
               onto the counter.  Dick begins counting it out.

               Dick cracks a sad smile for a second.  He bags the CD and 
               Vince and Justin are off.  Rob walks back through the stock 
               room door.

               Dick sticks his head in the door, looks at Rob, looks where

               listens, looks a bit worried.

                         going to leave me for one of them.

               Charlie turns around and looks at Rob with naked ambivalence.

</b>                         What I really learned from the Charlie 
                         Debacle is that you gotta punch your 
                         weight.  Charlie was out of my Class: 
                         too pretty, too smart, too witty, 
                         too much.  What am I?  Average.  A 
                         middleweight.  Not the smartest guy 
                         in the world, but certainly not the 
                         dumbest.  I've read books like The 
                         Unbearable Lightness of Being, 
                         Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time 
                         of Cholera, and understood them, I 
                         think -- they're about girls, right? -- 
                         just kidding -- but I don't like 
                         them very much.  My all time top 
                         five favorite books are Johnny Cash's 
                         autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil 
                         Stevenson, Zen and the Art of 
                         Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser 
                         Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't 
                         know, probably something by Kurt 
                         Vonnegut.  I look through the New 
                         Yorker when my neighbor's done with 
                         it, and I'm not averse to going down 
                         to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles 
                         films, although on the whole I prefer 
                         American films.  Top five being Blade 
                         Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first 
                         two Godfathers which we'll count as 
                         one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining.  
                         I'm okay looking, average height, 
                         not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if 
                         I can call it that, is to combine a 
                         whole load of averageness into one 
                         compact frame.  You might say there 
                         were millions like me, but there 
                         aren't, really: Alot of guys have 
                         impeccable music taste but don't 
                         read, alot of guys read but are really 
                         fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to 
                         women but have stupid beards, alot 
                         of guys have a Woody Allen sense of 
                         humor but look like Woody Allen.  
                         Some drink too much, some drive like 
                         assholes, some get into fights, or 
                         show off money, or do drugs.  I don't 
                         do any of these things, really.  If 
                         I do okay with women it's not because 
                         of the virtues I have, but because 
                         of the ugly flaws I don't have... 
                         So.  Charlie and I didn't match.  
                         After her I was determined to never 
                         get out of my league again.

                         But I didn't know that at the time.  
                         All I saw was that I'd moved down a

                         pity.  And that's when Laura came

</b>                         I'm reorganizing my records tonight.  
                         It's something I do in times of 
                         emotional distress.  When Laura was 
                         here I had them in alphabetical order, 
                         before that, chronologically.  
                         Tonight, though, I'm trying to put 
                         them in the order in which I bought 
                         them.  That way I can write my own 
                         autobiography without picking up a 
                         pen.  Pull them all off the shelves, 
                         look for Revolver and go from there.  
                         I'll be able to see how I got from 
                         Deep Purple to The Soft Boys in twenty-
                         five moves.  What I really like about 
                         my new system is that it makes me 
                         more complicated than I am.  To find 
                         anything you have to be me, or at 
                         the very least a doctor in Rob-ology.  
                         If you wanna find Landslide by 
                         Fleetwood Mac you have to know that 
                         I bought it for someone in the fall 
                         of 1983 and then didn't give it to 
                         them for personal reasons.  But you 
                         don't know any of that, do you?  You

               Rob hangs up the phone.  He fills up his glass again, takes 
               a swig, and slumps into a chair.  If there was any wind left 
               in Rob, it just got knocked out.  After a moment, he gets to 
               his feet, grabs his jacket and heads out the door.

               Rob comes down the street and gets in the short line to enter 
               the club.  From inside he hears a GUITAR, playing a tune 
               that becomes familiar not only to Rob, but to us.  When a 
               strong, lilting female VOICE begins to sing, we hear what it 
               is: "Baby I Love Your Way," by Peter Frampton.

               Rob smiles at first, but begins to darken as the verse 
               continues.  He steps out of line and leans against the outside 
               wall, listening.  Is he beginning to cry?  Yes, he is...

                         sense at twelve to realize was so 
                         saccharine and stupid as to be

               He looks around self-consciously, and paces a bit, deciding 
               whether or not to stay.  He takes a deep breath, and heads 
               in the door.

               As Rob enters he looks to the stage, where MARIE LASALLE is 
               standing alone with her acoustic guitar, heading toward the 
               song's finish.  Rob's expression begins to shift from the 
               melancholy to something else altogether.  Marie is beautiful, 
               and Marie has touched his heart.  Rob navigates toward her 
               though the small crowd as if pulled by something unseen.  He 
               addresses us over his shoulder.

</b>                         Sentimental music makes you nostalgic 
                         and hopeful at the same time.  Marie's 
                         the hopeful part.  Laura's the 
                         nostalgia part.  These things happen.  
                         They happen to men, at any rate.  
                         This is why I shouldn't be listening 
                         to pop music.

               As he gets closer to the stage --

               Rob looks over to see Dick sitting with Barry, a few feet 
               away.  He shakes it off and sits with them, extending a 
               meaningful hand to Barry, who takes it.  They turn back to 
               the stage as Marie finishes the song.

</b>                         But now I kind of like it.

               Dick and Barry nod, then keep watching.  All three of them 
               are in their own private fantasies with Marie.

                         "The" at the front of the title of 
                         the album.

</b>                         It's a reference to a Chinese meal 
                         in Toronto and I think that there is 
                         a "The."  But I could be wrong.

               They drop it, so that their eyes can drift back to Marie.

               Dick and Barry wait nervously to buy a tape, Rob just behind 
               them.  Marie processes sales with polite monosyllables, until

               Rob looks over Barry at Marie.  She catches his eye as she 
               looks over the room.  His eyes shoot to the floor.

               Rob is going through a huge stack of used CD's, sorting them 
               off into different bins, bouncing his head absently to the 
               music -- the same song of Marie's that Rob had on when Laura 
               called last night.

               into a smile, then walks fast back to the stock room door.

               heard.  Laura's eyes go to the ceiling, and Rob sits up at 
               attention.  They look up at the light fixture, which shakes 
               a little faster, with the rhythm of the creaking.  Someone 
               is definitely having sex upstairs, and they are going for

               Rob mounts the stairs and rings the doorbell.  The door opens, 
               revealing a too-tan WOMAN in her late forties, in designer 
               jeans and a T-shirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign.

               She says nothing.

</b>                         Hi.  You called about the records?

               She turns and walks into the house, leaving the door open 
               for him.  He follows her in and through a fabulous first 
               floor, packed with big-bucks bourgeois: Rugs, art, and 
               antiques:

               She ushers Rob into a large study, and turns the light on.  
               He misses a breath.  The walls are lined with mahogany cases 
               custom-built for CDs, albums, epicurean stereo components, a 
               couple priceless vintage guitars -- every one of the thousands 
               of items bear a little numbered sticker, like a museum.  She 
               points to several boxes on the floor, full of hundreds of 
               singles.

               Rob steps into the room like an Undeserving, and carefully 
               drops to his knees to examine the singles, each pristine in 
               a plastic sleeve: the original God Save the Queen by the Sex 
               Pistols, original Otis Reddings, Elvis Presleys, James Browns, 
               Jerry Lee Lewises, Beatles... on and on.  The mother lode.  
               Rob is doing the best to control the onset of 
               hyperventilation.  He dares a glance over his shoulder to 
               her to see if this is a joke.

               Rob's face goes funny.  He looks around for a hidden camera.

                         He had the fucking nerve to call me

                         I told him to fuck off, so he asked 
                         me to sell his singles collection 
                         and send him a check for whatever I

                         Which reminds me.  Can you make sure 
                         you give me a five?  I want to frame

               Rob looks back at the records but avoids the trance.

                         Send him forty-five bucks and blow 
                         the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or

               the same: colored lightbulbs, shadowboxes, deep plush booths 
               and a stage for jazz.  Rob slumps back in a booth, stirring 
               a drink with his finger.  After a beat, we hear a DOOR SLAM 
               off camera, and Rob looks up with a bit of fear.

               Heavy footsteps get louder and closer, until a shadow shrouds 
               Rob -- LIZ stands in front of him.

               begins to play.  Rob turns away from her and makes a face, 
               but she knows he's making it.

                         didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted

               Laura turns the engine off and unbuckles her seat belt.

</b>                         Let's go in.

               She gets out of the car.  Rob turns to camera, speaking 
               quietly and urgently.

<b>                                     ROB
</b>                         Okay, Number two: The stuff I told 
                         her about being unhappy in the 
                         relationship, about half looking 
                         around for someone else: She tricked 
                         me into saying it.  We were having 
                         this state of the union type 
                         conversation and she said, quite 
                         matter-of-factly, that we were pretty 
                         unhappy at the moment, and did I 
                         agree, and I said yes, and she asked 
                         whether I ever thought about meeting 
                         someone else.  So I asked her if she 
                         ever thought about it, and she said 
                         of course, so I admitted that I 
                         daydream about it from time to time.  
                         Now I see that what we were really 
                         talking about was her and Ian, and 
                         she suckered me into absolving her.  
                         It was a sneaky lawyer's trick, and 
                         I fell for it, because she's much 
                         smarter than me.

               He scrambles out of the car.

               The lock turns and Rob enters, holding the door for Laura 
               who slips by, her coat in her hands.  She glances down at 
               the table by the door and sees Ian's envelope.

               She slips it into her purse.  He stands facing her for a 
               moment, then crosses to her, takes her coat and tosses it on 
               a chair.  She opens the closet and takes out a big laundry 
               sack.

                         my record collection?

               She begins putting books and other things into the bag...

               Having no comeback, Rob goes for the moral high ground.

                         didn't know she was pregnant.  Of 
                         course I didn't.  She hadn't told me 
                         because I had told her I was... sort 
                         of... seeing somebody else.  We 
                         thought we were being very grown-up, 
                         but we were being preposterously 
                         naive, childish even, to think that 
                         one of us could fuck around and then 
                         own up to it while we were living 
                         together.  So -- I didn't find out 
                         about it 'til way later.  We were 
                         going through a good period and I 
                         made a crack about having kids and 
                         she burst into tears.  I made her 
                         tell me what it was all about, and 
                         she did.  I felt guilty and so I got 
                         angry.  She told me that at the time 
                         I didn't look like a very good long-
                         term bet.  That it was a hard decision 
                         and she didn't see any point in 
                         consulting me about it...  When the 
                         whole sorry tale comes out in a great 
                         big --

                         Look, this has nothing to do with 
                         anyone else.  You know that, don't 
                         you?  I left because we weren't 
                         exactly getting along, and we weren't 
                         talking about it.  And I suddenly 
                         realized that I like my job, and I 
                         like what my life is could be turning 
                         into, and that I'm getting to a point 
                         where I want to get my shit together 
                         and I can't really see that ever 
                         happening with you, and yeah, yeah, 
                         I sort of get interested in someone 
                         else, and that went further than it 
                         should have, so it seemed like a 
                         good time to go.  But I have no idea 
                         what will happen with Ian in the 
                         long run.  Probably nothing.

                         Over nine million men in this country 
                         have slept with ten or more women.  
                         And do they all look like Richard 
                         Gere?  Are they all as rich as Bill 
                         Gates?  Charming as Oscar Wilde?  
                         Hell no.  Nothing to do with any of 
                         that.  Maybe fifty or so have one or 
                         more of these attributes, but that 
                         still leaves... well, about nine 
                         million, give or take fifty.  And 
                         they're just men.  Regular guys.  
                         We're just guys, because I, even I, 
                         am a member of this exclusive, nine 
                         million member club.  In fact, Marie 
                         is my seventeenth lover. "How does 
                         he do it?" you ask. "He wears bad 
                         sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke, 
                         he hangs out with the Musical Moron 
                         Twins, and he gets to go to bed with 
                         a recording artist who looks like 
                         Susan Dey-slash-Meg Ryan.  What's 
                         going on?  Listen up, because I think 
                         I can explain, with all modesty aside: 
                         I ask questions.  That's it.  That's 
                         my secret.  It works precisely because 
                         that isn't how you're supposed to do 
                         it, if you listen to the collective 
                         male wisdom.  There are still enough 
                         old-style, big-mouthed, egomaniacs 
                         running around to make someone like 
                         me appear to be refreshingly 
                         different.  If you can't hack this 
                         simple strategy, there are some women 
                         out there, of course, who want to 
                         get pushed around, ignored and mowed 
                         over, but do you really want to be 
                         with them anyway?

               ...he goes through a door into the bedroom.  Marie is taking 
               off her earrings.

               Barry just looks at Rob.  He pulls out a Game Boy and begins 
               playing.

                         liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with 
                         Laura -- oops -- once with me and 
                         Dick.  We had that conversation about 
                         the possibilities of the guy making 
                         ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth

</b>                         How the fuck am I supposed to know

               Dick exits.  Rob watches the door close behind him, and looks 
               out over the empty store.  He TALKS TO CAMERA as he goes to

                         worried about how his life is turning 
                         out, and he's lonely, and lonely

                         happened, maybe something real, or

               see the silhouettes of Laura and Ian in the window.  He picks 
               up the phone, drops a quarter, and hits the numbers hard as 
               he dials... a muffled male "hello?" is heard and Rob hangs

               scruffier than Rob, and looks not unlike Leo Sayer/Steve

                         calm, and ready to start again.

                         wasn't that I really liked Marco

                         more, shall we say, attractive than 
                         him.  It was just that he knew he 
                         was good-looking and you didn't, and 
                         that made a difference somehow.  You 
                         used to act as if I was weird for 
                         wanting to spend time with you, and 
                         that got kind of beat, if you know 
                         what I mean.  Your self-image started 
                         to rub off on me and I ended up 
                         thinking that I was strange.  And I 
                         knew that you were kind and 
                         thoughtful... you made me laugh, and 
                         I dug the way you got consumed by 
                         things you loved... and Marco seemed

                         More sure of himself?

                         I was dragging you around, sort of.

                         in a group called Barrytown.

               Rob opens the door to find Laura filling a duffel bag in the 
               living room.

                         out.  I thought I'd be gone before

                         I'm so used to some things being

                         actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had 
                         no right to do that, and I told him

                         it, to be honest.

               Rob flops onto the couch and surveys the room.

</b>                         It's a dump, isn't it?

               Laura sits down, on the other side of the couch.

                         how much are you making now?  Sixty?  
                         Seventy?  And you were living in

                         not as if Ray's place is any better.

</b>                         I'm sorry, but can we get this 
                         straight?  What is his fucking name, 
                         Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?

<b>                                     LAURA
</b>                         Ray.  I hate Ian.

</b>                         I hate him too.  So I just call him 
                         "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis 
                         the Sissyboy."

               Laura starts laughing, laying on the couch on her back, very 
               close to Rob.  Rob leans in, sort of looking down into her 
               eyes.

                         in ages, and then you see the error 
                         of your ways.

                         does, if that's what you're getting 
                         at.  But I already knew you could 
                         make me laugh.  It's everything else 
                         I don't know about.

                         when I feel like it.

                         your bath water.

               She laughs.  He moves in, not really trying to kiss her but 
               leaving the door open for her... She almost goes for it, but 
               instead gets to her feet.

               She goes to her bags.  Rob points to a pile of CDs.

                         I know you bought them for me, and 
                         that was really sweet of you, but 
                         that was when you were trying to 
                         turn me into you.  I can't take them, 
                         I know they'd just sit around staring 
                         at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by

                         understand?  That Sting record you 
                         bought for me... that was a present 
                         for me.  I like Sting and you hate

</b>                         What's the point in thinking about 
                         it?  If I ever have another 
                         relationship, I'll buy her, whoever 
                         she is, stuff that she oughta like 
                         but doesn't know about -- that's 
                         what new boyfriends are for.  And 
                         hopefully I won't borrow money from 
                         her, or have an affair, and she won't 
                         need to have an abortion or run away 
                         with the neighborhood, and then there 
                         won't be anything to think about.  
                         Laura didn't run off with Ian because 
                         I bought her CDs she wasn't that 
                         keen on, and to pretend otherwise is 
                         just... just... psychowank.  If she 
                         thinks that, then she's missing the 
                         Brazilian rainforest for the twigs.

                         the Universe's first album for new 
                         girlfriends, then I might as well 
                         give up, because I'm not sure I know

                         Laura.  Laura and Ray, actually.

               Rob begins to turn red.  Anger, sorrow, everything else 
               building.

                         I know I can't speak now because 
                         Laura's father died, and I just have 
                         to take it because otherwise I'm a 
                         bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, 
                         self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking

                         But you know, Liz... I can either 
                         stick up for myself or believe 
                         everything you say about me and end 
                         up hating myself.  And maybe you 
                         think I should, but it's not much of

                         But is this really the time?

                         once would do.

               Rob looks around the room, beginning to hyperventilate and 
               near tears.  He sees Laura in a corner of the room surrounded 
               by four or five mourners.  He crosses to them and breaks 
               through to her.

</b>                         I'm sorry.

               He breaks away from her and slips out the front door.

<b>               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON
</b>
               So darkened by weather that it is almost night, raining 
               torrents and big sheets.  Rob emerges from the front door of 
               Laura's parents' house and begins walking down the street, 
               hands thrust into his pockets.  The rain almost immediately 
               soaks him.

<b>               EXT. ANOTHER STREET
</b>
               In the distance, Rob runs toward us.  As he gets to us we 
               move with him down the street.  He is drenched.  We hear the 
               rain, and his ragged breath.  Headlights appear behind him 
               and backlight him, getting brighter as the sound of an engine 
               gets louder.  Rob takes a look over his shoulder, looks 
               desperately left and right, and vaults himself over a small 
               brick wall and into a flower bed, landing on his back in the 
               black wet earth.

               The big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows 
               deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and 
               staring up at the sky.  Off-camera the car engine catches 
               up, and a door opens and shuts.  He sighs and shuts his 
               eyes...

               He opens his eyes again, to see Laura's face, wet as well, 
               staring down at him.  It is difficult to distinguish rain 
               from tears.

<b>                                     LAURA
</b>                         Are you going to lie in that flower 
                         bed all night?

</b>                         Uh... No.

               But Rob keeps lying there.  Laura pulls herself to a sitting 
               position on the wall just above him.

<b>                                     LAURA

</b>                         You're also an idiot.

               Rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall 
               next to her.

                         thing I wanted was... that's why I 
                         left, because... I lost it, and I 
                         didn't want to blow my top in there, 
                         and... look, the reason I fucked 
                         everything up was because I was 
                         scared.  I just wanted you to know,

                         I was sick of you.  And I needed 
                         something to snap me out of it.

               They swing their legs over the wall and walk to Laura's VW.

<b>               INT. LAURA'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
               They drive sort of aimlessly through Laura's old neighborhood.  
               Laura sees something on her left, and makes a sudden turn up 
               a narrow road through some overgrown trees.  They come to a 
               stop in a formerly paved clearing, looking out on a field 
               with an old abandoned school on the other side.  Laura shuts 
               down the engine.

                         and put my hand in the fire.  Unless

               She pulls herself over him, staddling him in the passenger 
               seat and kissing his neck.  She pauses and regards him from 
               above.

               Laura reaches down and unzips his pants, as they keep kissing.

               Laura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry.

                         just a few weeks ago and now you're 
                         worried I might kill you, and you're 
                         entitled to worry.  Isn't that a 
                         terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?

               She rolls off of him into her seat.  They sit there in 
               silence, watching the rain run down the windshield.

                         worried about where Ian has been.  I 
                         have no idea where he's been, and 
                         that gives me every right to insist

                         the power that interested me more 
                         than the fear.  I wanted to hurt 
                         her, on this day of all days, just 
                         because it's the first time since

               Rob and Laura lean back in a booth, facing each other.  We 
               get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since

                         Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking

               He turns slowly to her.  A giggle from her turns into a laugh,

               Rob looks at them.  Then at Dick.  Then through the window 
               at Barry, inside looking out.  Then at his own reflection in 
               the window.  Then back at them.

               After dinner.  Rob ambles in from the dining room.  Laura 
               close behind.  He looks through the bookshelves until he

               and scans the titles: Tina Turner.  Billy Joel.  Kate Bush.

                         exactly that.  Over the edge, in

                         of everything: one morning I woke up 
                         to find her going through my records,

                         me playing when I deejayed and putting 
                         them into the little carrying cases

                         She also knew how happy I was when I 
                         used to deejay.  From which every 
                         angle I examine it, it still looks 
                         as though she's done all of this

                         longer than it might seem.  You gotta 
                         kick off with a killer, to hold the 
                         attention.  Then you have to take it 
                         up a notch, but not blow your wad, 
                         so maybe cool it off a notch, and 
                         you can't put the same artist twice 
                         on the tape, except if some subtle 
                         point or lesson or theme involved, 
                         and even then not the two of them in 
                         a row, and you can't woo somebody 
                         with Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow 
                         Taxi" and then bash their head off 
                         with something like GBH's "City Baby

                         lived through it all in my head.  I 
                         know the whole plot, the ending, and 
                         the good parts.  Now I'd have to 
                         watch it all over again in real time, 
                         and where's the fun in that?  And 
                         fucking--when is it all going to 
                         stop?  Am I going to jump from rock

                         there aren't any rocks left?  Am I 
                         going to bolt every time I get itchy 
                         feet?  Because I get them about once 
                         a quarter, along with the store's 
                         tax bill.  I've been thinking with 
                         my guts since I was fourteen years 
                         old and, frankly speaking, I've come 
                         to the conclusion that my guts have 
                         shit for brains.  You know what's 
                         wrong with Laura, what my problem 
                         is?  What's wrong with Laura is that 
                         I'll never see her for the first or 
                         second or third time.  That's all.  
                         Fuck it.  I'll probably mail the 
                         tape.  Probably.

<b>               INT. ARTFUL DODGER - NIGHT

<b>               TWO TURNTABLES
</b>
               with the mixer in the middle. "Just Begun" by Jimmy Castor 
               spins on turntable #1.  A hand reaches in, and begins to 
               draw the slides down, quieting the music.

               Rob looks up from behind the deejay table, set up amongst 
               the instruments.  The place is packed with people, and 
               everyone seems to be having a great time.

               Almost everyone -- Rob sees Barry, who pretends to nod off 
               when Rob catches his eye, and Justin, who looks back at him 
               and mocks a bulimic act.  Rob gives him the finger.  He sees 
               Laura, and she beams at him.  He comes to the front of the 
               stage, and taps a microphone.

</b>                         Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight.  
                         I hope you have a good time.  And I 
                         hope you like the record.  The one 
                         by the Kinky Wizards.  The record 
                         that we're having this record release 
                         party for.
                              (hoots from the crowd)
                         Thanks.  Listen to it first, though.
                              (laughs)
                         Okay.  We'll get to that later.  
                         Right now, I'd like to introduce...
                              (mumbles)
                         Sonic Death Monkey.

               Good-natured applause.  Rob steps down and bee-lines to Laura.  
               Barry and his crew mount the stage.  Rob takes a big gulp of 
               beer.

                         I'm an idiot.  I should have played 
                         the record first.  This place is 
                         about to get burned down.

</b>                         It's gonna be fine.  These people 
                         are ready for anything.

                         Yeah, well...

               Barry stands in front of the mic, surveying the crowd with a 
               smile.  He and the band all wear suits and ties.

</b>                         Thanks for the enthusiastic intro, 
                         Rob.  We're not called Sonic Death 
                         Monkey anymore, though, ladies and 
                         gentlemen.  We might be on the verge 
                         of becoming the Atavistics, but we 
                         haven't decided yet.  But tonight, 
                         we are... BARRY JIVE AND THE UPTOWN 
                         FIVE!  ONE TWO THREE --And they launch 
                         into Marvin Gaye's "Got To Give It 
                         Up," almost flawlessly faithful to 
                         the original.  Barry is transformed -- 
                         shuffling footwork, a wide smile, 
                         and when the intro winds up, an almost 
                         perfect falsetto.  The crowd goes 
                         nuts, filling the floor.  Rob is 
                         stunned, begins to smile.  Laura 
                         takes his hand and leads him out 
                         into the crowd...
