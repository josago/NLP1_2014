           Andy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in
           the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to
           tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink
           from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time.

</b>           And love slipped the bonds of
           restraint...
           At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties,
           funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring
           at Andy.

           Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a
           bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad,
           writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work.

           from the cell door as the gob of

           Sitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ;
           a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect
           than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes,
           books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian
           - Thomas Hardy. He is writing. 

<b>           GLEN (V.O.) 
</b>           This complex contemporary matrix is 
           what Hardy meant by `the ache of

           deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'.

           forensics hunched like vultures.
           The dreadful mundanity of murder,
           he thought.

           Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of
           the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid
           best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from
           a magazine.

           she's now mumsy and countrified.
           She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection.
           Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up.

           The driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe
           gets out. She's twenty eight, startlingly beautiful. She
           looks around shocked, for the culprit.
           The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes
           it in, with an expression of such distaste that it might as
           well be a landfill site.

           As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in
           her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette.

           Tamara drives up to an old farmhouse. She gets out of the car

           At the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown,
           neglected garden. She peers through the back door into the
           kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of
           recent abandonment.
           Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over
           her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She
           backs away. She doesn't know what to do.

           old maps, wildlife and framed letters from grateful writers

          Glen opens the door a chink. They are feet away from him.
          Nicholas looks unshaven, shagged and guilty.

</b>           I'm sorry.
           Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms,
           holding each other.

           Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He
           opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks
           again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on
           the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again.
           Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating.
           He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas
           releases Beth. She wipes her eyes.

<b>                          BETH
</b>           I've got to go to the bottle bank.

</b>           Me too.
           Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange.
           He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas'
           lies.

           covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young

           next to it as if it has just been used. Tamara picks it up.

           Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from
           the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He
           slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away.

           the noise. Ingrid looks as if she couldn't give a damn. Over
           by the barn she sees Glen, unaware that he's being watched,
           breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music. She
           smiles.
           At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the
           hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a

           There is one girl in the band, bass guitarist Fran Redford.
           The drummer, Ben Sergeant, is also vocals. The lead singer,
           Steve Culley, is mixed-race; confident and charismatic.
           He is getting very up-close and personal with Fran. Ben is
           getting more and more furious.
           In the wings, we see Tamara talking to a publicist, trying to
           make herself heard above the roar of the music. She is
           pointing at Steve and Fran. The publicist nods.
           Suddenly Ben leaps up and takes hold of Steve, pulling him
           away from Fran. There is a scuffle, Fran trying to separate
           the boys. Ben takes a microphone.

           Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the
           ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name.
           Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara.

           need an income to run Stonefield.
           And mine's bigger than yours!
          Glen nuts him. Nicholas slips backwards in the mud. He whacks
          his skull on the sharp, rusting corner of the trough. He
          falls to the ground. Glen is astonished at his own prowess.

</b>           Now... get up, Nicholas. Let's talk

          Blood trickles from the wound on Nicholas' head. He moans.

          Glen becomes aware of a sound like a drumbeat, the drumming
          of hooves. The herd of cows come over the brow of the hill
          and down towards them. Boss is chasing them, barking. The
          beasts are terrified, stampeding.

           to get up on his knees.

</b>           Nicholas! Get up! Run!
           Glen puts out a hand to help him. But before Nicholas
           notices, he instinctively retrieves it.
           Glen turns on his heels and runs, terrified. He throws
           himself into the hedge as the cows thunder past. They
           disappear down the hill, Boss still behind them.
           Glen looks back towards the water trough. Nicholas is lying
           on his front, his face pressed into the mud, unmoving.
           Glen walks over. He gingerly peers at him. The back of
           Nicholas' skull is broken open. Blood is pooling in the mud
           and shit. Glen panics. He looks all around. Has the accident
           been seen?
           No human is visible. Has his part in it been noticed? He
           bends down as if to turn the body over, in case by some
           miracle Nicholas still lives. He cannot bring himself to
           touch him. Fear overwhelms him. He runs away.

           Her eyes, still red with grief, are full of their future
           together.
           Glen nods. He will stay. He wants it all.
           Beth leans into him, seeking comfort. He puts his arms around
           her, his face ashen with the weight of his secret.
           As he holds her, he looks around the room. Nicholas is
           everywhere, glaring down at him from photographs.

</b>
           Tamara is in the garden, a strip on her nose. She sees Andy
           in the dusk. He's leaning against the gate watching her.

<b>                          TAMARA
</b>           Don't say anything.

<b>                          ANDY
</b>           Kind of suits you. And I always did
           like the old one.
           They are in each others arms. The embrace lasts and lasts.
           Tamara is leading Andy up to the house.

<b>                          TAMARA
</b>           You did it on purpose, didn't you?

<b>                          ANDY
</b>           What?

<b>                          TAMARA
</b>           Made it so beautiful I'd never be
           able to leave.

<b>                          ANDY
</b>           Been dying to get rid of you. This
           is my house. I was born in that
           room.

          They are at the threshold. They kiss.
