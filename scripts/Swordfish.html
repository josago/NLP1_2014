    We hear OVER...

<b>                              GABRIEL (V.O.)
</b>                You know the problem with
                Hollywood? They make shit.
                Unbelievable, unremarkable shit.
                I'm not some grungy filmmaker-
                wannabee searching for
                existentialism through a haze of
                bong-smoke. It's easy to pick
                apart bad acting, short-sighted
                directing, or the purely moronic
                stringing together of words many
                of the studios term as prose. No,
                I'm talking the lack of realism.
                Realism. Not a pervasive element
                in the modern American cinematic
                vision.

<b>    INT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
</b>
    Three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and
    talking. Two of the men sit on one side of the table;
    STANLEY is in his early thirties, AGENT ROBERTS, early
    forties. Both wear suits, the younger's is fairly
    expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough
    said. The MAN across, however, is quite different. He
    is what they used to call a "cool-cat."

<b>                              GABRIEL (MAN)
</b>                Take Dog Day Afternoon for
                example. Arguably Pacino's
                greatest performance, excepting
                The Godfather, Part I, and
                Scarface, of course. A
                masterpiece of directing, easily
                Lumet's best. The acting, the
                script, cinematography, all top
                notch. But, they didn't push the
                envelope. What if in Dog Day,
                Sonny really wanted to get away
                with it? What if, and here's
                where it gets tricky. What if
                they'd started killing hostages?
                No mercy, no quarter, meet our
                demands or the cute blonde in the
                bell bottoms gets one in the back
                of the head, bam, splatter. What?
                Still no bus?

</b>                 How many innocent victims would
                 they let get sprayed across the
                 windows before the city reversed
                 its policy on hostage situations?
                 And this was 1976. No C.N.N., no
                 C.N.B.C., no M.T.V. No Internet.
                 Fast forward to the present, same
                 situation. Can you imagine the
                 feeding frenzy of the modern
                 media? In hours it would be the
                 top story from Boston to Budapest.
                 All caught in 150 millimeter zoom,
                 computer enhanced, and color
                 corrected. You would practically
                 taste the brain matter. Six
                 hostages die. Ten. Twelve.
                 Twenty. Thirty. Relentless. One
                 after another. All over a bus, a
                 plane, and a couple of million
                 dollars that were federally
                 insured.

    He sits, letting the pictures sink in, then:

</b>                 Just a thought. I mean it's not
                 really within the realm of
                 conventional cinema, but what
                 if...?

                        (looking at watch)
                 Well, guys, gotta jet. This place
                 is kinda dead.

    CAMERA PANS AROUND the coffee shop. Not a soul in the
    place. We CONTINUE TO PAN AROUND 270 DEGREES TO the
    front door, which is open. Outside the open doorway are
    crouched a squad of heavily body-armored SWAT members,
    packed together, and aiming automatic weapons inside.

<b>                               GABRIEL

    He gets up. In his left hand, which has been hidden by
    the table until now, he is holding a strange-looking
    spring-loaded grip. Gabriel is looking back at them.

    Gabriel out of the coffee shop.

<b>                               GABRIEL
</b>                 Thank you.

    Gabriel looks back at Stan sitting in the booth.

<b>                               GABRIEL
</b>                 Stanley... you coming?

    Stan slides from the booth as Gabriel exits the coffee
    shop --

    SILENCE -- no sounds on the SOUNDTRACK.

    Gabriel and Stanley stop just outside the doorway.
    Gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades, then continues
    across the sidewalk and into the street.

    He nonchalantly looks up. Suddenly the THUMP of
    HELICOPTERS and the WAIL of SIRENS dominates the
    soundtrack.

    Pandemonium. HELICOPTERS RIP the sky, L.A. County PD and
    a bunch of news vultures. Squad cars block off both ends
    of the street while SWAT trucks, news vans, and looky-
    loos are packed together into the distance.

    Sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are
    positioned on every open rooftop. Hundreds of weapons
    are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as
    if he's on his way to Sunday service, without a care in
    the world.

    Slowly, Stanley follows Gabriel into the street.

    Gabriel steps up on the far sidewalk, a huge armored bus
    blocks most of the windows. He walks beside the bus,
    under a huge "WORLD BANC" sign, and through the glass
    front door, which shuts IN OUR FACE.

    He turns away from the window and we FOLLOW him.

    The interior of the bank looks like New Orleans on Fat
    Tuesday. Three Hummers sit in the middle of the floor,
    surrounded by broken glass. Between them rests a bright
    red Ferrari F50 (Gabriel's).

    All but one of the front windows of the bank, the one
    with the door in it, has been welded over with 3/4 inch
    plate steel.

    Over two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor, arms
    cable-tied behind their backs. Something has been duct-
    taped around their chests and each is wearing what
    appears to be a dog collar.

    The other occupants of the room are nine men. All of
    whom would look as if they were attending the fashion
    event of the year were it not for the automatic weapons
    each one carries.

<b>                                 GABRIEL
</b>                 How we doin'?

    One of the ARMED MEN finishes putting a collar on a
    young, normally good-looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara,
    whimpering blonde girl.

    The front door opens and one of the suited men drags out
    the pretty blonde from earlier. She is sobbing and is in
    such grief she can't even walk.

    We cannot see the headlines. Federal and state officers
    scramble around handling problems. The PHONE RINGS.
    Assistant Director Bill Joy (A.D. JOY), an older-looking
    guy who looks more like an accountant than an assistant
    director of the FBI, is handed the phone.

     AXL TORVALDS enters customs. A thirty-something European
     who could easily pass for a season regular on
     "Sprockets."

     We PULL BACK. Torvalds is watching anxiously as his bags
     are torn into like Christmas day at the Griswalds. The
     two CUSTOMS AGENTS eye his three laptops suspiciously.

                  -- that equipment is quite
                  expensive.

     Torvalds is wary of time. After several moments his bags
     are being repacked when another passport is found.

     The customs official holds up two passports. ANOTHER
     CUSTOMS OFFICIAL takes them and walks over to Torvalds.

<b>                                ANOTHER CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
</b>                  Mr. Torvalds. Could you step
                  over here, please.

     Torvalds glances at his watch.    1:45 PM.

     Torvalds stands to the side, while two customs officials
     compare his passports. They step over to a computer
     terminal and punch in some data. It's 1:50 PM.

     Torvalds notices a customs department employee wheeling a
     cart of confiscated items out of a nearby service
     elevator. He pushes the cart out of the oversized
     elevator.

     Torvalds shoots a glance back to the two officials
     discussing his situation.

     Torvalds casually picks up his computer case and coolly
     walks over to the elevator.

     Torvalds walks in just as the doors close.

     The customs officials conferring look around. Torvalds
     is gone. One of them looks up and sees the numbers
     changing above the elevator.

     Torvalds exits the elevator -- and coolly makes his way
     to the pedestrian walkway. He's halfway across it, when
     -- multiple security teams appear and converge on him
     from both ends.

     He's finally wrestled to the ground.

     Stan stands on the roof of his trailer, which was a
     dilapidated shack in the 1950s and now is a lot worse.     A
     chained but scruffy-looking Rottweiler runs around in
     front of the trailer.

     Stan looks completely different than he did in the
     opening sequence. He hasn't taken very good care of
     himself. His hair is long, and right now standing on
     end. He is wearing nothing but a dirty towel, and is
     slicing golf balls off the roof. Whack.

     As the Ferrari drives up he begins hitting golf balls at
     it, but he just isn't very good. Nevertheless, after a
     dozen bad hits, a lucky shot ricochets off the aluminum
     hood.

     Roberts sits down in a chair facing Torvalds.     He stares
     at him a moment, just smiling, then...

     Torvalds looks at Roberts' badge and says something in
     Finnish, the only recognizable word being "Roberts." The
     attorney and Torvalds both laugh. Roberts looks at the
     attorney.

     Roberts grabs him by the collar and slams him into the
     wall, then pushes him out the door with a kick in the
     ass. He grabs the briefcase and tosses it out after him
     and locks the door.

     He turns on Torvalds, smacking him across the face. He
     pushes him into the wall and holds his badge in front of

     screwing a silencer on to his .45. Torvalds leans closer
     to the glass.

     Bad Agent #2 sticks the silenced barrel of the gun up

     around a large, oval table is our antihero, Gabriel
     Shear, surrounded by a handful of his crew and a gaggle

                  every subscriber's E-mail and
                  scrambled the systems. He did
                  what the federal judges wouldn't
                  do and kept the government out of

     He is handed an open laptop, it glows. He sets it on the

<b>                                HELGA
</b>                  You like tequila, Stanley?

     Helga shoots the tequila, then turns to Stanley, places
     her lips against his. The gold liquid drips from their
     lips as she spits it into Stanley's mouth.

     He pushes her away, breaking the liplock, and swallowing
     the tequila. She licks it from his face.

     Ginger interrupts him by slamming Stan between the
     urinals and ramming her tongue into his mouth with the
     kind of wet, aggressive action that takes a movie from
     PG-13 to an R.

     When the kids realize that the urinals are occupied, they
     leave. Slowly Ginger takes her tongue out of Stan's
     mouth. They look at each other. She smiles at him.

     As he realizes she's right, he's got nothing to lose.
     Slam! He smacks the mirror with his fist, then walks out
     of the rest room. Ginger slowly lifts the cigarette.
     She exhales, then slowly smiles. She's got him.

     Next to the valet stand, Gabriel leans over the hood of

     The outer edge appears nonexistent, like the water hangs

     A very hip but very nasty soiree is in progress.    More

                  pretty hard without a gun to my

     She reaches out and pulls him to her.

</b>                  Well, let's put a gun to your

     She kisses him and slowly he responds.       She smiles.

<b>                                GINGER
</b>                  Tell me about your worm, Stanley.

     Stan shakes his head.

</b>                  I thought you were Gabriel's.

     bends forward to whisper in his ear.

     Lounging by the pool is none other than our heroine,
     Ginger, topless, wearing nothing more than tiny, oblong,
     green-tinted shades, a skimpy T-back, and a little silver
     ring through her left nipple. She's reading Steven
     Hawkings' A Brief History of Time. A shadow falls over
     her.

     The shadow moves.       Ginger glances nonchalantly up, then:

     They stare at each sharing a moment of God-only-knows-
     what, then both break into smiles like two giddy seventh-
     graders at the local skating rink.

     Stanley nervously clears his throat.    She's got him.

                  Just a thought.

     He looks at her with open mouth amazement. In just 24
     hours, she already knows what makes him tick.

     She looks up from her book and winks at him, then returns
     to her reading.

</b>
     A SCHOOL BELL RINGS and three hundred screaming kids of
     all ages come running from the doors.


<b>     ANGLE ON HOLLY
</b>
     Not your average ten-year-old. Even decked out in bell-
     bottoms and sandals there is something about the way she
     carries herself that is older; wiser; sadder.

     She walks into a CLOSEUP and scans the driveway.
     Reflected in her tiny, round lavender shades we see the
     circular driveway of the school jam-packed with buses and
     parental types in their M-series Mercedes and their Lexus
     SUVs. She sighs. We CRANE UP, PANNING LEFT.

     Holly walks to the edge of the street oblivious to the
     mayhem. She looks up and down the street then slowly
     drops her backpack and sits down on the curb. She pulls
     a well-worn copy of William Gibson's Neuromancer from her
     backpack, and turns up the raging ELECTRONICA from her
<b>     WALKMAN.

     Now there is much less pandemonium. No more buses. We
     CRANE DOWN TO a MEDIUM of Holly still in the exact same
     spot. Holly sighs, pulls back her headphones and grabs
     her StarTac from her backpack. She opens the phone and
     dials.

     She stands up, ready for a fight. And there, next to her
     is her father; transformed. Under his arm is a three-
     foot-tall stuffed giraffe wrapped with a big red bow.

     He holds the stuffed giraffe to her.

<b>                             HOLLY
</b>               Oh, Daddy. If Mom finds out
               you're here she's gonna have you
               thrown back in jail.

</b>               It's okay, baby. Let me give you
               a ride home.

     He grabs her stuff.

<b>                               STANLEY
</b>               C'mon.

     He walks toward Ginger's silver Mercedes CLK which he's
     borrowing. Holly runs and jumps on his back. They laugh
     as he carries her to the car.

</b>               I've found a way to get you back,

               I'm taking it. Just give me a

     Holly quickly kisses him, jumps out and runs, crying,
     from the car at full speed, with the giraffe.

     Stanley, tears rolling down his face, slaps the steering
     wheel, trying to figure out how he screwed up his life so
     badly.

     Suddenly, the passenger door opens and a man in a DARK
     BLUE SUIT and fed-issued shades gets in.

<b>                                STANLEY
</b>                  Yep.

     Stanley whacks the fed with his elbow across the bridge
     of his nose and jumps out of the car.


<b>     INT. TAURUS

     Stan runs across the hood of the Taurus and just jumps
     over the railing.

     We realize what Stan did probably wasn't the smartest
     move in the world. The cliff is just barely on this side
     of 90 degrees and drops off about five hundred yards
     straight down to the PCH.

     Stan falls in SLOW MOTION about thirty feet before the
     cliff face angles out enough to break his fall. He begins
     a combination of sliding and tumbling down the bluff.

     the car.

     Roberts hangs in mid-air a moment, then he too begins the
     rolling fall down the hill.


<b>     ANGLE ON STANLEY
</b>
     as he tries to keep his balance, is being beaten and
     battered by the sharp, rocky ground.

     Finally, he shoots off an outcropping and free-falls for
     fifteen feet. Then it really gets bad.

     Clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill
     to help control the erosion. To Stanley however, it is
     the world's largest Slip and Slide.

     He is no longer able to control, even badly, his descent.
     Now, he is flying down the cliff face, only the rocks and
     bushes that slam into his body, slows the descent.

     Roberts, above him, is doing little better.


<b>     LONG SHOT ON CLIFF FACE
</b>
     As Stan and Roberts slide toward the eight lanes of
     blazing afternoon traffic on the PCH.

     Finally, Stan bounces onto the black-top road.   He runs
     headlong into the traffic.

     CARS SCREECH, HORNS BLARING, as they slide into each
     other. Stanley does not lose the single-minded focus of
     escaping.

     Roberts, now at   the bottom himself, watches as a CAR
     SLIDES sideways   into Stan, flipping him over it. Stan,
     not stopping to   feel the pain, runs across the hood of a
     freshly-stopped   car.

     On the other side, Stan runs down to the beach and runs
     down the sand at full-tilt, looking for any escape route.
     Roberts has made up some time due to the auto-pedestrian
     accident which slowed him down a little. Stan however is
     faster.

     Stan does his best Jerry Rice, as he runs down the beach
     at full speed.

     Suddenly, the Taurus comes tearing-ass across the beach
     at Stanley. Stan veers, now running through the surf.
     The Taurus veers as well, and Stan is forced to slide
     across the hood to keep from getting whacked. The Taurus
     breaks left, and slides further into the surf.

     The FBI driver hits the accelerator and bogs the Taurus
     down, tires spinning, throwing sand. Stan continues to
     run as Roberts makes it to the Taurus.

<b>                             ROBERTS

     He pulls his .40 CAL. from his shoulder holster and FIRES
     it into the air. Roberts bends over trying to catch his
     breath.

     Stanley stops, putting his hands up.

     Ginger walks in and closes the door. She walks over to
     the dresser and takes off her earrings. Then she reaches
     under her dress and unVelcros the modified 10mm. Glock
     and its thigh holster, dropping it on the dresser. She
     then pulls off the hip, little designer dress she is
     wearing, revealing the fact that she is wearing a tiny
     transmitting receiver taped between her breasts.

     She stares at herself in the mirror for a moment, then
     slowly starts to untape the bug.

     Ginger grabs her Glock and spins around, the holster
     dropping away with the touch of a button.

                  to launder drug money and gather

                  companies started making money.
                  Lots of money. By 1986, when
                  Operation Swordfish was
                  terminated, there was close to 400
                  million dollars in the D.E.A.'s

                  and it's his job to protect you.
                  But if he ever bites you, even
                  once, you gotta put him down. You
                  can't have an uncontrollable
                  weapon running unchecked in your
                  back yard. He becomes a
                  liability. You never know who he
                  might bite next.

     Stanley works at the keyboard. He reaches for his glass
     of wine and it is empty. He grabs the bottle. It, too,
     has been drained. He sighs and walks into the kitchen.

     In the wine cellar, Stan looks around. He opens one
     door, closes it. He opens another, same thing. The
     third, he pulls out a bottle. Keeps it. He pulls on
     another door and it is locked. He pulls again. Nothing.
     The glass doors of the temperature-controlled reach-in
     wine cooler is opaque with condensation. He bends close.
     Stanley swipes off the condensation inches from his nose.

     CARS CRASH. He is calm, cool, but continues to glance in

     Gabriel slides left into an alley, gets it under control
     and SCREAMS toward the other side. A black Suburban
     pulls up, closing off the alley. He slides to a stop and
     slams it into reverse. Backwards at 60-plus miles per
     hour.

     a duffel bag. He unzips it, and withdraws what the
     Marines call a SAW -- a Belgian-designed machine gun,
     compact but with 1500 rounds of Swiss cheese action per
     minute, powerful enough for the U.S. to replace the M-60.

     blocked them in. The one from the other side and a third
     comes toward them down the alley.

     The speedometer needle is pegged at 0 as they SCREAM
     backwards.

     Gabriel unfolds the stock and then withdraws a 100-round
     box wrapped in white tape and printed with AP. He clips
     it and pulls back the bolt. He grabs the wheel from
     Stan.

     As the Diablo slams backwards into the Suburban at sixty
     mph. Bam.

     Gabriel unbuckles himself and stands up through the open
     roof and UNLOADS FULL-AUTO into the Suburban. The armor-
     piercing SHELLS PENETRATE the Armalite GLASS, RIPPING the
     occupants to shreds.

     Gabriel turns, FIRING at the other Suburban.

<b>                                  GABRIEL

     passenger side. The wheels spin, the Lambo is wedged
     under the Suburban.

     Finally the mortally wounded but still kicking
     Lamborghini tears free of the Suburban and rockets head- on
     toward the other. Stanley drives like a maniac.

     Gabriel RIPS it on FULL-AUTO, meatloafing the driver.
     The Suburban veers into the wall. Smack.

     Stanley whips beside it and Gabriel STRAFES down the
     side, opening it up. Stan whips right onto a main
     street.

     More Suburbans head at them. Stan SCREAMS left into
     another alley. Through the cross streets whipping by at
     100 mph, we see Suburbans parallel to them.

     Stan cranks his wheel right.

     The Lambo rolls to a stop and Gabriel hops out, running
     at the Suburbans.

     After a moment of all-out GI Joe-style blitzkrieg, it's
     over.

     Gabriel walks to a body lying in the street.    He turns
     over the body and looks at the face.

     Reisman, dressed in your average, fly-fishing garb,
     stands in the shallow water of a wide river, thinking he
     has contained the situation, is doing what he enjoys
     most. He rewinds the reel and flicks it out again; the
     hook sails into the distance.

     A huge Cohiba cigar hangs from his satisfied grin.

     Faintly, we hear the WHINE OF MACHINERY. Jim hears it,
     too, odd since we are so far in the boonies. He looks
     around, then up and we PUSH IN TO a CLOSEUP.

     An evil-looking, camouflaged gunship suddenly crests the
     hill directly above him, ROTORS THUMPING.

     Reisman ducking, his cigar falling from his mouth, has to
     fight to hold on to his ridiculous fishing hat.

     Reisman drops his rod and digs into the fishing box at
     his right. Gabriel saunters toward him as the helicopter
     disappears over the rise. Reisman is not happy.

                  Ahh, the great American outdoors.
                  I'll never understand the appeal
                  of fly-fishing, Jim. A little too
                  much like masturbation for me,
                  without the payoff.

     Gabriel looks around, suddenly realizing something.

     Gabriel starts to laugh.      Reisman doesn't catch the joke.

<b>                                GABRIEL
</b>                  Oh c'mon, Jim. You gotta see the

                   the deck of some eighty-foot

      He turns to walk off. Stanley looks around. He spots a
      generator and moves toward it. Stanley reaches down to
      the power board on the generator and gives a large dial a
      twist.

      Suddenly, the hundreds of lights in the rack begin to
      arc. In a shower of GLASS they start EXPLODING from the
      huge amperage shooting through them from the generator.
      Gabriel turns to see Stan standing next to the generator.
      He moves toward him just as the room goes black.

      Early morning in Los Angeles.    People go peacefully about
      their early morning business.

      Suddenly, three red, white and blue Hummers crest a hill
      and tear TOWARD us down the street.

      Halfway down the street, they veer right, jump the curb,
      and SMASH through the front PLATE-GLASS WINDOWS of the
      World Banc.

      As the Hummers roll through the furniture and flying
      glass, the side doors fling open and well-dressed men in
      Italian suits and sunglasses jump out. Customers scream
      and try to flee but are quickly corralled with MACHINE

</b>
<b>109   EXT. STREET (SOMEWHERE IN SANTA MONICA) - MORNING           109
</b>
      A red FERRARI F50 whips around the corner at light speed,
      SCREAMS down the street TOWARD us and SCREECHES to a halt
      outside the bank. It shifts into reverse and slowly
      backs over the curb and into the bank.

      A huge armored bus rolls down the street, through two
      parked cars, and up onto the sidewalk, effectively
      sealing off the front of the glass bank. Mercs begin
      welding metal plates around the armored bus. We hear the
      approaching SIRENS of a fleet of cop cars.

      Several of the mercs finish putting some sort of collars
      on several hostages, including a young, normally good-
      looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara, whimpering blonde
      girl.


<b>112   INT. MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING                                     112

      Stanley busts into her house. In the living room,
      Melissa and the infamous Larry the Porn King are both
      face-down in a pool of blood. Stan freaks. He runs from
      room to room yelling Holly's name. The house is
      deserted. Stanley bursts through the door into Holly's
      room. The room is empty and in disarray.

      Stanley is standing in the bank. Three mercs in Donna
      Karen suits point modified M-16s at his head. He stares
      at the ground, shaking his head. Gabriel tosses his
      frappacino against the wall.

      Gabriel walks towards the window, slinging his FN-FAL,
      and pulling on his headset. A.D. Joy answers.

      Gabriel snaps his fingers and a ballistic cloth duffel
      bag is thrown to Gabriel. Gabriel is very unhappy. He
      looks at Stanley who is terrified of its contents.

      Gabriel jerks out his weapon and jams it against Stan's
      head as he and Marco roll around on the ground.

<b>                                 STANLEY

                   jumps every 60 seconds from one
                   numbered account to another and
                   will for the next ten years.
                   'Course it wasn't supposed to
                   happen for another six hours. The
                   power surge must have scrambled
                   the internal clock. But, you kill
                   me and you never get a single
                   dollar.

      Gabriel eases up, wheels spinning at millions of RPMs.

      Marco pulls a length of towing cable from one of the
      Hummer's winches and throws the line over one of the 30-
      foot-high ceiling buttresses.

      Gabriel grabs the cable as it comes down as two mercs
      rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife to his
      throat.

      Marco grabs Ginger and drags her kicking, fighting, over
      to where Gabriel stands, brandishing the cable.

      Stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow. Gabriel
      hooks the end into a noose with the tow hook, and puts it
      over Ginger's head, pulling it taut around her neck. He
      cuts the cable-tie loose. She digs at them with her
      fingers.

      Two mercs rush in and grab Stanley, one placing a knife
      to his throat.

      Stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow.

      Stanley looks at her lifeless body as they lower her.

      Stan around the neck in the crook of his arm.

      A MAN, whom we have not seen before but does maintain a
      certain "Gabriel" air about him, hiding behind shades,
      leans against a three-hundred-year-old column reading a
      newspaper.

      She walks toward him and he signals for the valet.

      He takes the $500 in cash from her hand and hands her the
      paper. They walk down to the dock, where a 50-foot off-
      shore cigarette boat waits, a valet standing next to it.

      He hands the valet the $500. Stepping down into the
      cigarette boat, he grins up at Ginger.
