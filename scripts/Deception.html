</b>          resting face up on a black surface. A beat of silence           -- is
          broken by its abrupt RING... RING... RING... Move in tighter
          on the phone's LCD DISPLAY. A number comes up:                  555-3827
          RING... RING... RING... A hand enters frame. We follow it to
          a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The
          hand picks up the pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find
          a list of handwritten numbers. At least fifty. To this series
          is now added 555-3827. RING... RING... RING...

<b>          EXT. MANHATTAN - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          We pan across the city skyline, a beautiful sight -- over
          which we hear the CLACKING of computer keys.

<b>          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM (RUTHERFORD STERN)                       - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          A wall of glass offers a letter-boxed view of a sleek
          conference room. Amber sconces illuminate an enormous table,
          empty save for & YOUNG MAN at the far end - a lonely figure
          hunched over a laptop.
          Steadily tighten on JONATHAN MESSER (late 20s), trim build
          not entirely at ease in a suit. Likeable features suggest a
          gentle, intelligent demeanor.
          Grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his
          glasses. Tired, he rubs his eyes, continues typing.

<b>          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          Briefcase in hand, Jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty
          cubicles. In a few offices lights are still on; the figures
          of YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN at work are blurred like photos out of
          focus behind the frosted-glass of closed doors.

<b>          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          Waiting for his train, Jonathan pauses at a news kiosk.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Do-you have tomorrow's Times yet?
          The grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn't look up.

<b>          OLD MAN
</b>          It is tomorrow.

</b>          Right. I forgot.
          The Old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh
          stack of newspapers. As he does, Jonathan glances at numerous
          porn magazines on display. Naked women smile back at him --

<b>          OLD MAN
</b>          Anything else?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Uh - no. No that's it, thanks.

<b>          EXT. BROOKLYN - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          Jonathan descends an above-ground subway stop. Neighborhood
          streets are vacant, the clopping of his shoes the only sound.
          Jonathan turns a corner, heads for a humble duplex, the first
          floor marked by unlit neon: "FLEURS DE SOLANGE." He ascends
          the steps, his keys out --

</b>          Jonathan!
          The voice from nowhere startles him - he spins to find
          SOLANGE                                                         (50), a vibrant Haitian woman with a thick accent,
          standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski jacket.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Solange, you're up so late?

<b>          SOLANGE
</b>          But why else does a young man come home at
          such an hour?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Just working late, that's all.

<b>          SOLANGE
</b>          Every night working late, working late.

<b>          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          Very modest. Furnishings are nice, but sparse. Jonathan hangs
          his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers.

<b>          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM
</b>
          Not much decoration other than a dated Jimmy Connors poster
          and an old tennis trophy. Jonathan lies in bed, flipping
          channels on a small TV. Typical late night stuff:
          infommercials; CNN; a Brazilian soccer match; "Channel J"
          (public access) on which X-rated clips advertise phone sex.
          Jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads                  - then clicks
          back to, the roaring soccer crowd. He closes his eyes and
          drifts off to the frenetic Portuguese of an unseen announcer..

<b>          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN LAW OFFICES - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING
</b>
          TWO CORPORATE LAWYERS are talking shop while pouring coffee.

<b>          JONATHAN                                                         (0.S.)
</b>          Excuse me.
          Fixing his coffee, Jonathan reaches past them. They barely
          give him a glance as they continue their conversation.

<b>          LAWYER 1
</b>          So, the Knicks win last night?

<b>          LAWYER 2
</b>          I'm pretty sure, yeah.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Actually, they lost by 4.
          Both pause, turn to Jonathan. Jonathan smiles awkwardly.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          It was supposed to be a good game though.

<b>          LAWYER 1
</b>          Oh.
          (back to Lawyer 2)
          Hey, so. did you get a chance to look over
          that memo from Watkins?

<b>          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN CORRIDORS - MORNING
</b>
          Bustling - yet here too Jonathan is ignored as he carries his
          coffee past ASSISTANTS and LAWYERS talking shop. He smiles

<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>          politely at those he passes; few bother to smile in return.

<b>          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING .
</b>
          Again Jonathan works alone at one end of the long table,
          rapidly typing, eyes ping-ponging from files to laptop,
          beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel-colored post-
          its on which are scribbled various calculations. He strikes
          us as extremely good at his job, tackling the overwhelming
          array of numbers and data with methodical assurance.
          Taking a break, he pauses to peer out the glass wall before
          him. Behind the glass, employees pass like fish in a tank.

<b>          INT. MEN'S WASHROOM -- DAY
</b>
          In a stall, Jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the
          stall's marble door -- when a sudden KNOCK-KNOCK on the
          divider to his right startles him. He peers down and over, to
          expensive black wingtip shoes, a Wall St. Journal spread on
          the floor. Another KNOCK-KNOCK. Confused, Jonathan turns to
          address the divider:

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Yes?

<b>          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
</b>          Take a look at this.
          The voice sounds youthful, energetic. Its owner slides his
          Journal along the floor halfway between the marble division.

<b>          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
</b>          The Japanese are developing a toilet that
          can analyze your urine for glucose levels,
          kidney disease, even cancer. They're
          referring to it as the "super bowl."

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          That certainly is                                               - something.

<b>          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Of course if you've ever been to Japan,
          you know they're nuts about their toilets.
          I'm talking web sites, symposiums...
          Jonathan chuckles.

<b>          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
</b>          You think I'm kidding. They have bowls
          over there that cost more than a piano.
          What I want to know is how you're supposed
          to retrieve this analysis - you know, from
          your super bowl.

          nursing degree. A superfly.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          None. I'm from Worth and Berman. I've been
          over here a few wee--
          A FLUSH from the next stall cuts him off. The sound of
          zipping up, of a belt buckled, then of a stall door opening.

<b>          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)
</b>          So you're an accountant?
          Jonathan follows the FOOTSTEPS, now addresses his stall door.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Audit manager, yeah.

<b>          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          So how's it work, Rutherford Stern hires
          Worth and Berman to give their blessing to
          our books, and they send you?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Have laptop, will travel. What about you?

<b>          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          What about me?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Well, I didn't get your name for one.th--
          The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out.

<b>          MALE VOICE                                                      (O.S.)

          Jonathan FLUSHES, buckles his belt, opens his stall door -
          - only the men's room is now empty.

<b>          COMPUVOICE                                                       (SOUND ADVANCE)

          Alone again, Jonathan listens to voice-mail on his cell
          phone. We..find two more batteries sitting ready in a charger.

<b>          PETERSON                                                         (O.S.)
</b>          Jonathan? Chet Peterson. Just wanted to-
          confirm you're wrapping up over there at
          Rutherford Stern because the controller at
          Clancey has been on me to get someone in
          there by Thursday. I told him how
          brilliant you are, said you're the best
          auditor we've got. Anyway, I forwarded you
          some documentation...
          Jonathan clicks his mouse - to find 27                           a-mails ending in
          worth&berman.com. He reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a
          day planner, stylus writes "Clancey" into next week. Other
          than places he'll be working, days-are-all entirely blank.

<b>          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Jonathan still working. Only a few of the post-its now remain
          on the tabletop. Yawning, he glances at his watch -

<b>                                                                                               MALE VOICE   (O.S.)

          Startled, Jonathan turns to a well-dressed young man in the'
          doorway - penetrating eyes, playful smile, familiar voice:

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Sorry if I scared you. I was heading home
          and saw the lights. We met before, in the
          can...

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Sure. It's Wyatt, right?
          WYATT BOSE nods as he steps into the room. There's something
          very likeably "on" about him.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          So do you normally work this late?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Pretty much. I'm supposed to be out of
          here by tomorrow so I'm just trying to
          finish up. What about you?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          You kidding? This is an early night. Hard
          to believe that once upona time a man's
          success was measured by how little he had
          to work. You know in Sweden the average
          worker gets 7 weeks a year vacation?
          (regards his stacked files)
          Do-you like accounting?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          It's all right, if you enjoy working with
          numbers. Do you like being a lawyer?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          It's all right. If you enjoy working with
          assholes.
          Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Well, I'm probably disturbing you -

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          No - it's okay. Really.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          So Worth and Berman, huh? Don't you have
          to like be in Mensa to work there?
          Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Been with them long?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Since my senior year of college. They
          subsidized my graduate degree.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Really. So you were poor?
          Jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question.

          raised by a single mother, and she died
          when I was nineteen, so... yeah. It wasn't
          so bad though. I'm sure a lot of people
          have had it worse.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Not around here. Practically every suit I
          know is Harvard by way of Andover.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Are you?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Me? Hell no... I'm Princeton. By way of
          Exeter.
          Jonathan laughs. Wyatt smiles, takes a few idle paces.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          So. Jonathan.

<b>          (GRINS)
</b>          What do you say to a break?

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>          CLOSE ON A SCREENSAVER OF SWIMMING FISH. Tilt up from
          Jonathan's laptop screen to Wyatt and Jonathan, sitting on
          top of the expensive conference-table, passinga joint,
          staring out at the rain hammering the far windows.

</b>          .It's just sometimes I feel so - I don't

          Jonathan pauses, takes another drag, train of thought drifts:

</b>          I don't know... I used to have friends.
          But it's like I've spent so much time
          trying to prove myself, working these

</b>          everyone. Just - fell out of touch. With
          everyone... And I try to meet people at
          work. I do. But it's always the same. To
          the accounting staff I'm a pain because
          for two weeks they have to hold their
          breath and hope I don't pick up on any of
          their screw ups. And to everyone else, I'm
          just a temporary fixture, so why bother?
          The truth is, this is the first meaningful
          conversation I've had in I don't know how
          long. It's like if I disappeared tomorrow,
          I'm not .sure anyone other than Solange
          would even notice - she's my neighbor. I
          live on what must be the only block in
          Brooklyn that still isn't hip.

          isolation. It's like sometimes I look
          through that glass, and I see life
          literally passing me by.
          Jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence.

          Wyatt looks at Jonathan -- and cracks up. Jonathan hesitates,
          then he too starts to laugh so now they can't stop, their
          laughter filling the expansive room -- until it's drowned by
          the SOUND ADVANCE OF POURING RAIN...

<b>          EXT. MIDTOWN - STREET - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          Jonathan hurries in the cold. rain for the Times Square
          subway. He's just about to descend - when across                7th Avenue
          he spots a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a camel hair coat,
          clutching a slim briefcase, waiting to cross the street.
          Jonathan gazes at her, almost gasping. She's surrounded by
          pedestrians with umbrellas., she's the only one without one
          and she's DRENCHED. But she seems content to entertain
          herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the
          umbrella in front of her.
          Jonathan watches, intrigued - and then the rumble of the
          subway below reminds him he'd better move.

<b>          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          Jonathan stands in a long line to buy a Metrocard, his
          glasses steamed up. He takes them off to wipe the lenses.
          JONATHAN'S POV: the entire station is a blur, all unfocused,
          muted colors, no object discernible from another -
          - until his glasses return his POV to immediate focus, and he
          sees the same Young Woman in'the camel.hair coat, a pair of
          dollar bills in her hand, entering the station.
          Jonathan can't help but stare again. Despite her business
          attire, there's an almost childlike lightness. to her step.
          Jonathan notices her slim briefcase. Beneath her hand, he can
          make out the first letter of a monogram: "S."
          She checks out the long line for Metrocards, considers
          waiting, then decides life's too short. She continues past,
          headed for the turnstiles.
          Jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase,
          then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow
          gap in the turnstile.
          A PANHANDLER on the other side watches her with amusement.
          Glancing up, she catches his eye, and blushes a mischievous
          smile. Once she's through, she drops her money into his
          collection - and slips out of view.
          ANGLE ON JONATHAN, still stuck on line, staring at the space
          she vacated.

<b>          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM -- SHORT TIME LATER
</b>
          Jonathan arrives as an N train pulls away, the platform now
          practically. empty.
          Weary and still a bit stoned, Jonathan peers sleepily into
          the dark expanse of tunnel, yawns -
          And then he sees "S" is waiting on the same platform. Ten
          yards away. He gazes at her. She's unwrapping some GUM. He
          watches as she puts a piece in her mouth.
          The sound of an ARRIVING N TRAIN. "S" heads for it, Jonathan
          follows...
          The train halts. The door before him is the last of its car,
          the door before her the first of the next.
          The doors open.

          Excuse me, is this the train for canal
          Street?
          It takes Jonathan a second just to find his voice. She's even
          more arresting up close.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Uh,.either one is                                               -- I mean the N and the

          way, I mean, this is the right train. Yes.
          SOS Of
          Thanks.
          "S" enters her car. Jonathan wavers, wants to follow into her
          car but doesn't have the nerve. He enters a different car.

<b>          INT. SUBWAY CAR - LATER
</b>
          Jonathan's slumped against a window, annoyed. at himself for
          not getting in her car.
          He can see 'S'. She sits in the other car chewing her gum. He
          studies her, he's absolutely knocked out by her.

<b>          CONDUCTOR (O.S.)
</b>          Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next.
          He sees "S" rising to join the small crowd gathering by a
          door.
          Jonathan stands up - his last chance. Determined, he braces
          himself and rises, grasping his briefcase.
          The screeching of brakes as the train grinds into "CANAL ST.

<b>          STATION."
</b>          A sudden JOLT of the braking train.causes Jonathan to stumble
          slightly and his briefcase BANGS against a seat and SNAPS
          OPEN - contents tumbling out. His cell phone hits the floor.
          Jonathan quickly bends for his phone - when the train lurches
          to a halt, nearly knocking him over, and sliding his cell
          phone a few feet along the grimy floor.
          O.S. we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan grabs
          for his phone a second before it's stepped on. He hurriedly
          stuffs it in his pocket, shoves his files and papers and
          paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet -
          - to find the doors closing, and "S" gone.

          the train begins to depart... He can just glimpse the back of
          her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a tunnel.
          He stands helpless, just shuts his eyes and lowers his head.

<b>          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - COFFEE LOUNGE - MORNING

          Jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing Wyatt
          enter, talking animatedly with Lawyers                          1   and 2. Caught up in
          telling his joke, Wyatt doesn't seem to notice Jonathan.
          Only when the lawyers burst out laughing does Wyatt glance
          up. His eyes meet Jonathan's. Jonathan smiles in greeting -
          but Wyatt just nods coolly, returns to his fellow lawyers.
          Jonathan's smile falters. He exits wordlessly.

<b>          INT. RUTHERFORD STERN - DAY

          Jonathan hands over files and CD-Roms to a less than sociable

          Jonathan turns to go, takes two paces - then turns back.

</b>          Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt
          Bose's office?
          The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Wyatt Bose. He's an attorney here.
          She sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a
          laminated page of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan's
          eyes follow her lazy finger down the list --

<b>          A GRUFF VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Hey, quit looking down her shirt!
          Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to
          find Wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor.

<b>          INT. MANHATTAN RACKET CLUB - DAY
</b>
          Beneath an enormous bubble dome, Jonathan and Wyatt play
          mixed doubles with two attractive YOUNG WOMEN (early 20's).
          Between points, we observe from Jonathan's side of the net
          Wyatt chatting up his partner. The rapport between Jonathan
          and his partner is markedly less comfortable; he wipes his
          brow, smiles at her, she forces a polite smile in return.

<b>          SAME SCENE - LATER
</b>          A good rally underway. Jonathan fires a backhand. Wyatt
          returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps the ball
          back to Wyatt's partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it
          back. Jonathan returns it with equal force.
          A grin on Wyatt's face as he savors the battle, blasting back
          each ball. The women step aside. Jonathan lunges, barely
          managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt raises his
          racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball.
          Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a
          near perfect shot just over Wyatt's head... but it lands two
          inches outside the opposite baseline.

          already gone to join her friend. Jonathan crashes out on the
          court. From his low angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to
          the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter.
          The girls finally wave goodbye. Wyatt hops over the net.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          They asked if we'd fancy a post-game
          cocktail. Don't worry, I got us out of it.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          I guess I could go home and change.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          To Brooklyn? Forget it, you can borrow
          something of mine.

<b>          INT. WYATT'S BUILDING - EARLY EVENING
</b>
          A three-story brownstone in an expensive West Village
          neighborhood. As Wyatt leads Jonathan to the staircase, they
          pass a papery-faced GENTLEMAN                                   (50s) in a fine suit.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          t                                                               a                       uten Abend, Herr Kleiner.
          (glances back)
          This way, Jonathan.

<b>          INT. WYATT'S APARTMENT
</b>
          Urban chic to a serious degree. Big terrace, funky furniture,
          framed snapshots of Wyatt with similarly hip and attractive
          young friends - and great art, including an entrancing image
          of a burning candle just slightly out of focus.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Like it? It's a Gerhard Richter. Kleiner
          downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he
          hooked me up with the gallery in Munich.
          Wyatt disappears into the next room. Alone, Jonathan wanders,
          pauses by the framed snapshots. The young people in them are
          like Wyatt -- beautiful, strong, wealthy. Jonathan pauses by
          one photo in which Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair
          bleached blonde and loosely spiked.

<b>          WYATT (O.S.)
</b>          Talk about a bad look.
          Startled, Jonathan quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right
          behind him,. a slick, expensive SUIT draped over his arm.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Here, try this one.
          (off Jonathan's hesitation)
          What?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Nothing, I just hope I can pull it off.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          You hope you can pull it off. You know who
          you remind me of? James Getz.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Who?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          A guy I roomed with freshman year at
          Princeton.. Real smart                                 - witty too, when
          you loosened him up. Only from day one, he
          just didn't fit in. For starters, he was
          dirt poor. But it wasn't that. See, there
          was always this boundary - this wall -
          between Getz and everyone else. You could
          argue we laid the foundation, but he built
          it. Built it by believing the lie.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          What lie?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          That he was any different. The clothes,
          the money, the wry anecdotes - it's all
          one big masquerade. Anyone can get in,
          you've just got to wear a costume. But
          Getz never got that. He assumed he could
          never scale the wall, when the truth is he
          was the only one guarding it. It never
          occurred to him his anonymity could be an
          asset. No one gets over like the guy who's
          just a face, an impression. We are - all
          of us                                                  - only who we're perceived to be.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          So what happened to him?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          (hesitates a beat)
          You're pulling my dick, aren't you.
          Wyatt turns to him with a grave look... then smirks.

          Jonathan can't help but laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit.

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>          CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN                                       (EMCEE) in a vintage bowler hat.
          He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders:

<b>          EMCEE
</b>          And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine,
          the Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you
          to the lovely Miss Lu Lu Lamour!

<b>          INT. THE VELVET ROPE - NIGHT
</b>
          An ultra-elite "new burlesque" nightclub in Manhattan,          1920s
          Parisian decor. Strictly UPSCALE PATRONS, male and female,
          sip from crystal barware, while on stage a BETTY PAGE TYPE
          performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease.
          Wyatt and Jonathan sit at a small table; each table is fitted
          with. an old-fashioned black rotary telephone, as well as a
          small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag
          films play silently. All part of the wink-wink ambience.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          It's a little self-conscious, but I
          thought you'd get a kick out of it. How's
          that suit working out?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Oh - great, actually.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Keep it then. I've got two just like it.
          Jonathan's about to protest, when a WAITRESS arrives.

<b>          WAITRESS
</b>          Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy, gentlemen.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Isn't this like fifty bucks a glass?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          We'll try not to spill any.
          (regards the floor show)
          So what's the wildest thing you've ever
          done? Sexually, I mean.

          never been too adventuresome.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          All right, what's the lamest thing then?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          The lamest...
          Wyatt's focused on him, amused, eager to hear it.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Actually, that was probably a few months
          ago. I was flipping through money magazine
          and saw this small ad in the back. It read
          something like "Are. you feeling all alone?
          Looking to meet women but have forgotten
          how?" And-there was this number.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          And you called it? So what happened?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Nothing actually. The phone just kept
          ringing. And that's it.
          Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to crack up.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Lame enough for you?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine.
          That is beyond lame.
          Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at their table
          lights'up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then
          picks up. He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          .Hello?
          Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE
          at a distant table, receiver to her ear, eyeing Jonathan.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          .All right... Goodbye.
          Jonathan hangs up, turns to Wyatt.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          She wants to dance.

</b>
<b>          ON THE DANCE FLOOR - LATER
</b>          Jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy Brunette to an old
          Edith Piaf ballad. He looks over her shoulder to his table,
          where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell phone.
          Glancing up, Wyatt's eyes meet Jonathan's; he flashes a proud
          smile. Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself.
          The Brunette leans in, whispers something in his ear...

<b>          BACK TO WYATT AND JONATHAN'S TABLE
</b>          Wyatt clicks off his cell phone, looks up to find Jonathan
          returning alone, looking deflated.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          She's a hooker.
          Wyatt shrugs, grinning.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Hold on - you knew? What - are all the
          women here prostitutes?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          That depends on what you mean by that
          word. Stretch the definition and you could
          incorporate most of the men as well.
          (sips his drink)
          You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only
          belong to a union, they have to pay taxes.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          You seem to possess quite a store of
          international trivia.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Not really. I just get around... Jonathan,
          relax. It's not like she just shot your
          dog. I was only trying to help. Besides,
          what are you looking for - a relationship?
          As if you have time for one? This was your
          first day off in how long?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Three weeks.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Four for me. Face it, we've mortgaged our
          youth. Pimped out our twenties. But we
          still have needs. And there's nothing
          shameful about wanting them met.

          Wyatt studies him a beat, another French love song drifting
          in the background as the Emcee introduces a new girl.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          What if I told you...
          (breaks off, laughs)
          Christ, I sound like an infommercial.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          What were you going to say?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Listen. You don't think that women have
          these same urges? Young women, just like
          ourselves, successful and working their
          asses off to stay that way? You better
          believe they do.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          And?

<b>          WYATT
</b>          And - well - let's just say, there's a
          way...a way it can be taken care of.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          You make it sound like a mob hit.
          Wyatt smiles, and turns his attention back to the floor show.

<b>          INT. TAXI CAB - LATE NIGHT

          Wyatt and Jonathan are in the back seat. A quiet beat.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          What you were talking about, before.

</b>          Yeah. Yeah I did. Thanks.

          Wyatt disappears into the golden glow of the lobby.
          LATER: Driving in the cab, Jonathan catches his reflection in
          the glass. He smiles, liking how he looks in Wyatt's suit.
          Outside, rainy Manhattan passes by ina hypnotic blur.

<b>          EXT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY - LATER

          Jonathan stands in the exact spot where he first saw "S".
          He buys a New York Times and a hot-dog.
          Pedestrians and theatre crowds pass by as he remains rooted
          to the spot,.hoping he'll see that face in the crowd.
          After a while he shakes his head at the ridiculousness of it
          and heads down into the-subway.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Right.I just need the access codes for

          The Controller suddenly looks uneasy.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          You've got account numbers, but no access
          codes. Without those I can't get the banks
          to authorize statement verification.

          Besides, how else can I steal the money?

          Jonathan is hunched over his laptop. Like Rutherford Stern's
          conference room, this one too is designed with a glass wall.
          Jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference
          to him. Slightly different tank, slightly different fish.

          Along the entire square of ledge, throngs of SUITED BUSINESS
          TYPES bundled in scarves eating street vendor fare. It's here
          we find Wyatt and Jonathan, having a quick bite.

<b>          WYATT
</b>          I wonder what the Founding Fathers would
          make of this scene.
          Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing
          expensive suits, wolfing down lunch so they can get back to
          work - a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          I'm just glad to be outside.

          I've got to tell you, this has been great,
          meeting up for lunch. I used to just-
          A cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their
          jackets, take out their identical phones. It's Wyatt's that's
          ringing. Jonathan rests his down on the ledge.

          Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before him an
          attractive BLONDE WOMAN. She's. around his age, slender to the
          point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit.

<b>          THE BLONDE

</b>          Yes. Yes we did -

</b>          Good. Let's go then.

<b>          INT. PLAZA - ELEVATOR
</b>
          Jonathan and the Blonde stand in an elevator alongside an
          ELDERLY COUPLE. The couple smile at the handsome pair.
          Jonathan fidgets uncomfortably. The Woman is staring at the
          lit numbers. He notices a ROOM KEY in her hand.

          Look, I don't think I'm -- I mean; you and

          She turns to him, the slightest smile on her thin lips.

</b>          No fooling.
          DING. The doors open. She steps out. A beat. He follows.

<b>          THE HALLWAY
</b>          Walls, carpeting - details all classically gorgeous. The
          Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a room.

</b>          It's just what... exactly?
          She turns, steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to
          explain -- when she covers it with hers. It takes him a
          moment to succumb to her kiss... but not too long.

<b>          INT. PLAZA -- A ROOM - LATER
</b>
          A smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies
          lower to them. The Blonde hovering over him, Jonathan's
          tentativeness is all but gone.
          Jonathan cradles her to him, her features softening under
          waves of pleasure as she gasps, and whispers in soft, slow
          annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our language:

<b>          THE BLONDE
</b>          Fuck.
          LATER: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then a look of
          mild anxiety, 'what's going on'? He turns to the Blonde but
          she's fast asleep.

<b>          INT. PLAZA - THE', ROOM - EARLY MORNING

          On the sound of a DOOR SHUTTING, Jonathan's eyes squint open.
          Still naked, he props himself up, leans over to find he's all
          alone. A clock radio reveals itself as the source of the
          FAINT CLASSICAL MUSIC we hear. The time reads:                  6:18   am.
          He rises, glances around the room. No sign of her.

          Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan shakes his head, amused. He hails a

          He approaches a REDHEADED BUSINESSWOMAN. He asks her

          Jonathan doing laps. He emerges from the pool, strides with
          confidence past the tourists flanking him on either side:
          OLDER COUPLES snoozing, PARENTS adjusting floaties on kids,
          BUSINESS TRAVELLERS with airport novels.

          for a young man to be too much alone.
          He gives her an uncomfortable smile. She smiles back, but as
          she heads inside, she looks both-sad and worried for him.
          Jonathan continues up the steps, opens the front door and
          disappears inside. We remain on the vacant street, hear his
          FOOTSTEPS climbing the steps - and then the muted RING of his
          cell phone. A beat, then another...

          turns to the sound: a bar off the lobby. Through slotted
          glass he scans the backs of heads: a group of business men.
          Reflected in the mirror, a WOMAN appears behind him. Jonathan

          Jonathan enters tentatively behind her, eyes still glued.
          "S" takes off her coat, drapes it over a chair. Jonathan
          remains still and silent, just watching. She undoes the
          wrists of her blouse, then the collar button.

          She fishes in her coat and pulls out a PACK OF GUM. The
          wrapper is entirely in Chinese. She offers him a piece.

</b>          Oh - no thanks.

          She chews her gum. He watches her; the jaw line, her lips.
          She looks at him and smiles, but there's something behind it:
          a sadness. Almost an uneasiness.

          leans in to return them to his face... only she presses her
          lips to his instead, the glasses still in her hand, the kiss
          itself at once tender and passionate.
          She absently lowers her hand, lost in the unexpected
          intensity of the kiss. Embraced, they accidentally step under
          the sheet of water falling off the awning. Jonathan guides
          her back beneath the awning's shelter.

          She smiles as he kisses her even more passionately. Again
          they feel the awning's drops, and Jonathan moves to shelter
          them -
          - only "S" leans into him instead, leading him out from under
          the awning, the falling rain suddenly drenching their faces
          as they continue to kiss, the moment purely exhilarating.
          wiping the rain from her face, Jonathan gazes at her, soaked
          and utterly beautiful, with something akin to awe - like he's
          just breathed for the very first time.

          As Jonathan exits the room, hold on the room number:            517.
          Jonathan runs down the long corridor to the ice machine. He's
          giddy with excitement. Passionately alive.
          At the ice machine: an eccentric OLD WOMAN in her night
          attire is slowly filling a bucket. Piece by piece.
          Her weak, gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to
          break her long nails.
          Jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration.

          conscious in his robe and bare feet.

          Jonathan arrives back at room 517. He pauses and slips his
          robe from his shoulder, mock 'sexy'. He puts the card key in
          the lock, starts to open the door-- a small rectangular light
          blips RED. He tries the card again. Again red. He knocks on
          the door, calls out:

          something behind the door. He peers down at the key panel:
          red.
          He knocks harder, waits for a response. None. Dead silence.

          He jostles the door handle: it won't budge. He's getting
          anxious now, his breath quickening. He tries the key card
          again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder into
          the door. Nothing.
          Desperate, he tries the key card again -- and the light turns

          glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket and sheets.
          Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath
          quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket.
          Panicked, he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed,
          splattered all over the crumpled sheets...
          Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him just

          Back in the room, he tries the closets: empty. The CONNECTING

          He stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are
          located. He crushes the down button, peers up to the floor
          indicator overhead: "4" slowly creeps to "3".

          His bare feet pounding the cement steps, Jonathan takes each
          floor faster, sweat on his brow and his palms which slip
          their grasp on the railing -- he tumbles head first, crashing
          to the 2nd floor landing. He clutches his head, gets up and
          continues to dash down...
          BANG! of the stairwell's exit as Jonathan stumbles out; he
          lurches forward, finally looking up to find he's in

          something that's caught his eye...
          HIS HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS TROPHY. Nothing unusual - except for a
          small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy

</b>          Yes, I need to get in contact with one of
          your attorneys, Wyatt Bose - it's
          extremely important. He's working out of

          Jonathan sits slumped against a window, the world around him
          is ceasing to make sense. Across the aisle, a YOUNG BOHEMIAN
          COUPLE sit side by side, her headon his shoulder. On
          Jonathan's face there's a sense of loss that is almost
          overwhelming.
          Jonathan takes the crinkled Chinese gum wrapper from his
          pocket, smoothes it in his hands, stares down at it with a
          look of longing...
          . when his eyes suddenly widen. He sees something inside,
          something he hadn't noticed. He unfolds it to reveal two
          words written in a feminine hand on the white underside:
          I'm sorry
          Jonathan quickly looks up, as if expecting someone else to
          share in this haunting discovery. of course, no one does.
          He stares back. down at it, bewildered, stunned - chilled.

          Beside the keyboard rests the receptionist's photocopy of

          on his desk,,resting under the phone: a manila file folder.

          Heart racing nervously, he takes one out: it's of Jonathan
          standing in the Plaza lobby by the Eloise portrait. Confused,
          he quickly flips to the next one: in it, a Blonde now stands
          there with him -- the Blonde found murdered. Simone Forester.

          Jonathan and Simone Forester getting in the elevator. Opening
          the room door. Undressing. Screwing. In one, Jonathan has his
          hands on her neck...
          He's sweating with anxiety- when suddenly the phone rings,

          Jonathan slowly hangs up, his panicked gaze returning to the
          hall closet as he paces toward it, throws open the door.
          In the far corner rests his racket bag. He grabs it, yanks
          open the zipper... his face draining of all remaining color
          as he peers into his empty racket ba                           . His racket is gone.

<b>          SAME - MOMENTS LATER
</b>          Jonathan pacing the floor, paranoid. He holds Detective
          Russo's card. Knows he should call back. He abruptly reaches
          for the phone, and dials... another number.

          He hits pound. Breathes. At least he's done something.
          Suddenly from O.S. a faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the
          room, grabs the nearest blunt object: his tennis trophy.

          A series of shots: Jonathan asking around about "S." The
          street vendors. The receptionist at the hotel. The waiter at
          the restaurant where they ate... They all shake their heads.
          Heading back for the subway, dejected, he steps on.a
          discarded page from the newspaper's Metro section, sees a
          headline: "STILL NO SUSPECT IN MURDER OF YOUNG EXEC." The

          Intensely preoccupied, Jonathan walks alone past assistants
          and execs. In his eyes a sense of paranoia, a mistrust of
          every strange face.

<b>          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Isolated behind yet another wall of glass, Jonathan just
          stares bleary-eyed at his laptop, unable to work.

          Jonathan exits, starts toward the sidewalk -- but hears
          something: sandpaper SHUFFLE of shoes on pavement. Be spins     --
          No one there. Just one of many large stone pillars adorning
          the building. Jonathan peers anxiously at the pillar,
          wavering. He steps closer, trying to glimpse behind it -
          RING! of his cell-phone breaks the stillness. RING... RING...
          He catches his breath, quickly picks up. A silent beat.

          He hangs up, chilled. Turns again to the pillar, steps closer
          - no sound. He hesitates... then turns and walks off.

<b>          INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT
</b>
          People heading home from work. Jonathan among them, utterly
          desolate. Sliding his MetroCard, he suddenly feels watched
          again. He spins, peers anxiously behind him. Only strange
          faces passing through turnstiles.

          A narrow, curved stretch of grimy walls of ads and graffiti.
          Jonathan keeps a quick pace, feeling vulnerable.
          We lag back, following him from an ANONYMOUS POV; glance up
          at a sign for stairs to the N & R trains.

</b>
          Jonathan is waiting for his train, eyes nervously glancing
          around, still feeling watched -
          When he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the
          opposite platform, waiting for a train. She casually turns
          her head, and Jonathan's eyes go wide...

          Jonathan just gapes across the divide of two subway tracks;
          he can't believe he's seeing her again...
          . when she starts to back away, almost as if she might run.
          Confused, Jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          wait! Wait, right there!
          Jonathan stands on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her.
          He looks around, hears the distant: .nimble of afar. off train,
          and suddenly he does something we'd have never thought him
          capable of: he jumps onto the tracks!
          He lands hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly
          scrambles to his feet, splashing in the sludge between rails,
          eyes darting along the track, anxious to avoid the third
          rail, ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he
          races for

<b>          THE CENTER DIVIDER
</b>          He reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up.
          He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only one lane
          of track separating him from the platform she was standing on
          - only she's no longer there?
          He scans the people waiting, no sign of "S" among them - and
          then suddenly he spots her, heading for the exits.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>
<b>          STOP!
</b>          She glances back, utterly stunned to find Jonathan standing
          on the center divider, feet soaked in muck.
          Neither speaks for a moment, just staring at each other
          across the solitary track. Then:

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          I thought you were dead!
          She looks like she wants to say something, but doesn't. And
          all at once he's hit with a crushing realization:

</b>          You are in on this, aren't you?!
          She holds his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion -
          then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again.

          to politics. I'd never met anyone so in

          he'd come from nothing, that everything he
          learned, he learned from his tricks. He
          claimed that Holloway was even grooming

          TILT UP to his face: an eerily blank, driven stare, devoid of
          real pleasure. She struggles, tries to protest - when his

<b>          EXT. EIGHTH AVENUE                                              (HELL'S KITCHEN)   - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          Porn shops and prostitutes, the streets pulsing with a
          sinister energy. Jonathan is pacing toward the subway,
          reading over the printed article.

<b>          EXT. BROOKLYN - ELEVATED SUBWAY PLATFORM - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          Jonathan descends the steps to his presently deserted
          neighborhood. O.S. the departure of the subway train is
          joined by the distant.wail of SIRENS.
          Jonathan continues down the block, then pauses. He wrinkles
          his nose, smelling something. He looks up: two blocks away, a
          thick plume of smoke is billowing up into the sky --

<b>          EXT. JONATHAN'S DUPLEX
</b>
          Jonathan bolts around the corner to find an ambulance and
          fire engine curbside -- a fire raging in the lower story of
          his building!
          Running toward the blaze, he speeds past a BLACK BMW parked
          across the street, engine running. It suddenly shifts into
          gear and peels out in a fast turn. Jonathan spins               - something
          about it troubling him - but the BMW is already gone. He
          continues racing toward his building...
          The neon "FLEURS DE SOLANGE" sign crackles and sparks in the
          flame. Through blown out windows, piles of burning flowers
          emit what must be an awful stench.
          Two EMS WORKERS are loading a gurney on which Solange lays,
          burned and half-aware, but alive, when Jonathan rushes over.
          She manages to open her eyes, her voice barely audible:

<b>          SOLANGE
</b>          Jonathan...
          He squeezes her hand as she's lifted into the ambulance.

<b>          JONATHAN'
</b>          (to EMS worker)
          Is she going to be okay?

<b>          EMS WORKER
</b>          Yeah, she'll make it.

</b>          The ambulance doors SLAM shut. A hand grabs Jonathan's arm.
          He spins                                                        - it's a FIRE WORKER.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          I live here.

<b>          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
          Thick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor. Suit jacket over
          his head, Jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the Fire Worker.
          His own door has already been kicked open, splintered at its
          hinges. The place looks like it's been turned upside down,
          furniture soaking wet, charred areas on walls.

<b>          FIRE WORKER
</b>          Lucky we were able to contain it somewhat.
          Better get your valuables together.

<b>          INT. JONATHAN'S BEDROOM
</b>
          still in shock, he tosses random clothes in a gym bag - "Duck
          on Bike" too.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          (calls out)
          How did it start?

<b>          FIRE WORKER (O.S.)
</b>          We're not sure. Maybe a bad fuse.

<b>          INT. JONATHAN'S BATHROOM
</b>
          Jonathan opens his medicine cabinet, takes out his small film
          cannister, uncaps it to see how much money he has left. Not
          very much. He stuffs the cannister into his pants pocket.

<b>          INT. SPARE BEDROOM
</b>
          Jonathan opens his old gunmetal-gray filing cabinet, then
          pops open his briefcase, trying to decide what to take.
          He finds a file marked "Bank Statements," pulls it, about to
          toss it in his briefcase - when he stops, something about its
          contents ---
          CLOSE ON THE FILE. Stuffed with paper. But not bank
          statements... Copies and copies of photographs of Jonathan
          with Simone Forester. Some we've seen, some new.
          Jonathan hunts through more files, his breathless nausea
          telling us the contents of each and every file have been
          swapped out with photos.

</b>          He opens another at random - and freezes: it's a photo of
          Jonathan and "S" walking in Chinatown. He scans through
          others, shots of them in the restaurant, entering the Hotel
          Lotus...
          TIGHT ON JONATHAN, terrified by the horrific implication -

<b>          FIRE WORKER                                                     (O.S.)
</b>          Mr. Messer?
          Jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the Fire Worker in the
          doorway. He quickly shuts the file.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          Just                                                            - give me a minute.

<b>          INT. JONATHAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
</b>
          A paranoid-looking Jonathan returns with a briefcase stuffed
          near to bursting. The tired Fire Worker looks up impatiently.

<b>          FIRE WORKER
</b>          That everything?
          Jonathan regards his minimal possessions, realizes how little
          evidence there is of a life. A wrenching sense of isolation.

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          I guess it is.

<b>          FIRE WORKER
</b>          You got someone you can stay with?

<b>          INT. A SEEDY HOTEL LOBBY - DOWNTOWN - PRE-DAWN
</b>
          The sort of decrepit no-tell motel frequented by hookers and
          junkies. Jonathan clutches his briefcase as he stares through
          steel mesh at. the NIGHT CLERK.

<b>          NIGHT CLERK
</b>          It's fifty for the night.
          Jonathan fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what
          he discovers are his last three                                 $20s.

<b>          INT. SEEDY HOTEL - ROOM - PRE-DAWN
</b>
          Even more depressing than the lobby: bars on the windows,
          stains on the thin walls through which the faint sounds of
          paid sex bleed in. Somewhere a bottle smashes.

</b>          Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents
          onto the bed. He stares at one of Wyatt's photos of him and
          "S." She's smiling up at him.
          EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF HER FACE. The smile, frozen in
          time, at once haunting and heartbreaking.
          He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune
          article he'd printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway
          ("BODY OF MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED"). His eyes
          drift to the article, and something suddenly occurs to him -
          FLASH ON: THE PHOTOGRAPH IN "WYATT'S.BROWNSTONE" of Wyatt
          with bleached hair styled in a loose spike --
          IN THE ARTICLE'S PHOTO, Holloway sports an almost identical
          look.-His eyes move to the date of the article: "May 17."

<b>          CUT TO:

<b>          OFFICE ON PHONE

          Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given him:

          Jonathan sits in suspense, awaiting a response. Finally -

<b>          OFFICER ON PHONE
</b>          Well?

<b>          JONATHAN
</b>          You've got a case, a missing person named

          Jonathan's eyes return to the Holloway article                 ("BODY OF
          MISSING BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED:), dated "May 17."

          Jonathan quickly hangs up, equally encouraged and chilled by
          the connection he's made.
          TILT DOWN to a post-it, on which he's scribbled: "BOSE =
          BANSKY = HOLLOWAY." To this he adds: "= JAMES GETZ"

<b>          INT. CHASE MANHATTAN BANK - MORNING

          A line of customers stare mutely up at plasma tv screens
          above - except for Jonathan, unshaven, suit wrinkled, face
          all anxious tension.

<b>          SAME - TELLER'S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER

          Teller examines the passport, then slides it back.

<b>          TELLER
</b>          M'kay, if you'll just swipe your ATM card.
          She gestures to a small punch pad to Jonathan's right.

</b>          Actually, my card was stolen.

<b>          TELLER

          Jonathan's cool is cracking. The Teller wrinkles her brow.

<b>          TELLER
</b>          Mm'kay, if you press "0" on either phone?

          Oh no? In the last few days I've seen a

          alive and a woman I assumed was alive turn
          up dead, both at the hands of a guy about
          whom everything I know is apparently a
          lie. I've had my building set on fire, my
          neighbor nearly killed, and my apartment
          ransacked. So please forgive my language,
          but it's been one fuck of a week.

          We recognize the DOORMAN in the midst of fielding a complaint

          the elevators, unnoticed.

          Jonathan emerges from an elevator. The last door on the left.
          Jonathan tries the doorknob. It's locked. Jonathan checks
          under the mat. Sure enough, there's a key.

<b>          INT. THE APARTMENT
</b>
          Utterly bare. Empty walls, expensive views, polished wood
          floors. Jonathan takes a wary step inside, leaning to peer
          around the corners.
          He paces cautiously through the living room. The dining area.
          The glistening chrome and granite kitchen.

<b>          THE BEDROOM
</b>          A room as empty as the others - with the exception of a small
          pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far corner. Jonathan
          slowly nears...to find it's a stack of mail. He picks up an
          envelope -- O.S. the CREAK of a door hinge.
          Jonathan whips around -- no one behind him. He steps out of
          the room to investigate.
          We remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat...
          .until Jonathan finally steps back in, only slightly at
          ease. He returns to the stack of mail, picks up an envelope.
          He reads: "Mr. Jonathan Messer 140 E.                           91    St..."
          Eyes wide, he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail -
          all addressed to him at this address.
          Jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief, when he
          finds at the bottom of the stack: another PHOTOGRAPH. It's of
          "S" standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the
          track from Jonathan. And suddenly Jonathan is gripped with
          fear, unaware of a blurred, nearing intruder...

          As he crosses the street a CAR HORN BLARES - WHIP AROUND to

          Jonathan seated at the far end of the empty table, typing on
          his laptop. Beside him is the envelope Wyatt gave him, and
          its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed.
          Jonathan peers at the laptop clock. It reads                            10:58   PM.
          His eyes travel in a tense triangle from instructions, to
          laptop screen, to glass wall - fingers typing all the while.
          He finally reaches a prompt: BIENVENUE. POUR ANGLAIS, CBOISEZ P2.
          We glimpse a small. logo with a SWISS FLAG.
          Jonathan presses F2. Reads some more, types some more.

          Jonathan enters more per Wyatt's typed instructions. Reads.

          petulantly. He's about to type...
          And then he halts. His eyes drifting to HIS CELL PHONE,

</b>          Give me the key then.
          Wyatt considers this, then takes out an electronic key card
          and slides it across the table. Of course there's nothing on

          Wyatt looks relieved -- when his view is abruptly blocked by
          the Auburn-Haired Woman.

          personal?
          Wyatt quickly looks up at her, momentarily confused.

</b>          What the hell are you --
          And then he sees Auburn Hair glance unsurely at the Eloise
          portrait, then at her cell phone's clock -- and now realizes:

<b>          WYATT
</b>          Motherfucker!
          He jumps up, shoves Auburn Hair aside - eyes darting to the
          Business Center to find Jonathan no longer behind the glass,
          just his laptop resting on the counter where he'd been
          standing.

          Jonathan rushes into an elevator car just as it's about to
          close. He turns to find a YOUNG FAMILY riding up with him.
          They've pressed floor 6. He presses floor                       9.

          Ding as the elevator doors open and the family step out.
          Jonathan is left alone, impatiently waiting for the doors to
          close -
          - when his eyes land on something in the hallway: the fire

          wave a flood of guests fill the stairwell.
          Wyatt presses against the crush of bodies, pushing his way up

          banged open by Jonathan's shoulder.
          The sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as Jonathan
          races down the carpeted corridor, room numbers blurring past
          in sporadic fits                                                -                                      925...921...           918...   913...   910...
          Jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room 907.
          He takes out his key card, about to slide it in the slot --
          when a hand grabs his forearm! He spins in panic to --

          The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan

          every corner, the bathroom, the closets. Everywhere.
          The sterile room taunts him - the uncreased bedspread, the
          neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary, the
          incessant moaning coming from the porn on the TV set --
          Jonathan suddenly erupts, grips the TV and shoves it off its
          ledge. It hits the floor with a crash, and sudden silence.

          And there she is, lying face down in a lifeless heap: "S".
          Panicked, Jonathan rushes to her, turns her over. She looks
          semi-conscious, hands and mouth duct-taped. Jonathan
          hurriedly removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by
          how lifeless she appears -
          - when her eyes widen, focus on his face. Before he can say
          anything, she throws her arms around his neck, presses her

          descend -- when Jonathan notices the hint of disruption in the
          flow of bodies below.

          evacuating.

          into the underside of the stairs just overhead.
          ON WYATT, realizing he needs a cleaner shot, taking the
          stairs even harder in pursuit, all merciless intensity.

          The party is still at full throttle. Apparently no one has
          yet told them of the alarms.

          suddenly bangs open and Jonathan and "S" spill out.

          beautiful faces, laughing, dancing.

          She grabs his hand, and they waste no time disappearing into
          the mass of bodies.
          They keep moving. Shoulder to shoulder within the swell of
          partiers, they fit right in - instantly anonymous                - though
          not as smartly attired.

          Jonathan grabs "S" as they duck, racing across the dark,
          rooftop, looking for a place to hide.
          They take cover behind a large venting duct near the ledge -
          gasping to catch their breath... Stepping back, "S's" foot
          clinks against something: a stray iron railing post.
          She reaches. down for it, starts to lift it -
          - when Wyatt's hand darts in and grasps the other end.
          She looks up in terror - when Wyatt punches her violently,
          knocking her to the ground.

          back, cupping a hand to his wound as he swings his gun toward
          Jonathan -
          - when with every ounce of strength Jonathan charges, Wyatt's
          shot missing him as Jonathan slams him into the ledge wall,

          the darkness. He exhales, then turns back to "S"                 -
          - to find she's right beside him, grateful tears in her eye.
          She leans into him, and he holds her tight, the two of them

          Strobed reds and blues of police and fire.trucks amassed,
          trying to control the throngs of guests and pedestrians
          blocking our view of the body they're all gawking at.
          We travel through the confusion until we find JONATHAN AND
          "S" sitting side by side on the sidewalk curb, each propped
          against the other.
          The 'shock of it all is beginning to fade. He reaches into his
          pocket and hands her 'Duck on Bike'.

          She winds the toy up. They watch it make it's funny way down
          the sidewalk.

          She nods.

          "S" considers the request, then smiles gently, leans in close
          and whispers the answer in his ear. Jonathan gazes at her a
          moment - whatever her name is, it must be perfect.

</b>          So what now?
          She smiles up at him.

          On Jonathan: treasuring these moments. He is truly free --
          perhaps for the first time in his life.

</b>          Yes. I'm free.
