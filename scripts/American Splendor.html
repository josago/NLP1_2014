</b>
<b>               A BEDROOM MIRROR.
</b>
               The room is dark. A perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on 
               a wall.

               Suddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's 
               face comes into focus. He stares straight ahead, perhaps 
               studying his own unrecognizable reflection. It's quite clear 
               this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray, 
               his eyes are confused. There is something most definitely 
               wrong.

               Tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving 
               the frame empty and dark.

<b>               ANGLE ON BED
</b>
               Like a ghost, the naked man (Harvey) stands over his bed 
               staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce). In the eerie light, 
               he's almost translucent.

                         Joyce... Joyce?

               Joyce springs up, alarmed.

<b>                                     JOYCE
</b>                         What's wrong, Harvey? What are you 
                         doing up?

               Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing.

<b>                                     JOYCE
</b>                         What is it?

</b>                              (delirious, out of 
                              breath)
                         Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who 
                         writes about himself in a comic book? 
                         Or am I just -- am I just a character 
                         in that book?

               Joyce rubs her eyes.

<b>                                     JOYCE
</b>                         Harvey...

                         goin'? Or will he just fade away...

               Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. Suddenly 
               Harvey collapses.

               Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. She gets down 
               on the floor and shakes him.

               His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away.

               A surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red. Similar to 
               the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus, 
               revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. But this 
               time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic 
               mask of the D.C. Comic hero -- SUPERMAN.

</b>
               It glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. A child's pupils 
               glare through the eye holes...

               The camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of another 
               caped-crusader: BATMAN. Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick 
               ROBIN, who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin.

               Next, we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to ring the 
               doorbell. The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt 
               KID wearing no costume at all. Looking irritated and removed 
               from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the 
               pockets of his shearling coat.

               He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door.

               The brick home is as working class as it gets. The lady at 
               the door is a 1950's HOUSEWIFE.

                         cute.

               The Lady drops a candy apple in each boy's container.

                         sidekick ROBIN, ohh, The Green Lantern 
                         even...

               She finally stops at the costumeless KID. He halfheartedly 
               holds up a ratty, stained pillowcase.

               The other boys giggle. The kid flashes them a "kick yer ass" 
               look.

               The kid shrugs.

               The Housewife stares at him, confused.

               Frustrated, the kid throws his pillowcase down. He trudges 
               off as the others watch in confusion.

               A grown-up version of HARVEY PEKAR (now mid-thirties) stomps 
               along the same Cleveland street. Unfortunately, 20 years 
               have made this rust belt neighborhood a bit rustier. The 
               "GROWN UP HARVEY" dons the same shearling coat, sports the 
               same disheveled hair, and wears the same curmudgeonly 
               expression.

               (Note: Each "Cartoon Harvey" looks similar but unique... A 
               variation on a theme. This is because his cartoons are drawn 
               by different comic artists.)

                         here, so lemme step in an' help ya 
                         catch up. This is the story about

                         whole life outta them. You could 
                         even say comics saved his life. This

                         all grown up and goin' nowhere. 
                         Although he's a pretty scholarly 
                         cat, he never got much of a formal 
                         education. For the most part, he's 
                         lived in shit neighborhoods, held 
                         shit jobs, and is now knee deep into 
                         a second disastrous marriage. So if

               The REAL HARVEY PEKAR (not the actor who trudged through the 
               credits) sits behind a microphone, supplying the "voice over" 
               above. He clutches a movie script in his hand.

               The frame is spare, with a few well-chosen items to indicate 
               that he's in a recording session.

               Although he is significantly older than the man who portrays 
               him, the "Real Harvey" is every bit as much of a sad sack... 
               maybe even more. He is large and slightly threatening with 
               knitted brows and wild eyes. Yet there is something kind and 
               vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick your 
               ass. Off Camera, WE HEAR the voices of the male and female 
               directors (us -- BOB and SHARI) coaching the "Real Harvey" 
               through his voice over. Harvey's irritable and contrary, 
               saying that the whole Halloween incident never even happened.

               "But I don't care man. I'm just doing this for the dough." 
               We learn that Harvey is a reluctant participant in a film 
               being made about his life.

               SUDDENLY, his third wife JOYCE BRABNER -- an intelligent 
               control freak obsessed with all things negative -- joins in 
               the conversation. Pushing back her huge glasses, she 
               reprimands Harvey like he is an infant: "Harvey you are 
               talking too loud, Harvey you are being difficult." Harvey 
               just rolls his eyes. Joyce gets offended. It is clear they 
               have had this argument a million times. As Joyce storms off...

               Harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the 
               movie. He laments that she is his third wife, and he has no 
               luck with women. "Man, chicks just don't dig me." That's why 
               he marries anyone who will have him. "And I marry them fast 
               before they get to know the real me..."

               Harvey's voice is hoarse, raspy and barely audible. It sounds

                         You have a nodule on your vocal 
                         chords. Probably from screaming and 
                         yelling too much. And if you don't

               He sheepishly grabs his throat.

               A silent sequence. A dejected HARVEY walks home alone along 
               an empty lot. Day-old dirty snow clings to the ground.

               He wanders through a down-in-the-heels neighborhood, passing

               Harvey approaches TOBY -- a dumpy 20-something going on 60- 
               something in ridiculous, mismatched polyester clothing. He 
               is odd, awkward and talks with a monotone, robotic voice. In

               Harvey barely looks up. He nods his head "yes" and keeps

               The kids laugh loudly. He wipes away the snow and walks on.

               A VOICE OVER interrupts the scene.

               Harvey's second wife LANA -- a hippyish chic with long hair 
               and a bad attitude -- pulls books off a shelf and selectively 
               throws them onto the floor or packs them into a milk crate.

               An overstuffed suitcase sits beside her. She's obviously 
               leaving him. HARVEY enters the room.

               Harvey's voice breaks up.

               That last yell did it. Harvey grabs throat in pain, torn 
               between his throat discomfort and trying to stop his wife

               She gathers her bags and heads for the door. Harvey trails 
               her, trying to reason.

               He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out.

               She turns and stares at him. Harvey tries to say something.

               But now nothing at all comes out of his mouth. Only wheezes 
               air.

               He tries again. No sound at all.

               Harvey sits on outdoor furniture. A few props are featured 
               in the frame indicating a garage-sale-like setting (including 
               a record player). Directly in front of Harvey are boxes of 
               used records.

               HARVEY shows us his prodigious record collection. Thousands 
               of LP's -- rare jazz, blues, fusion, klezmer, etc. -- are 
               piled in floor-to-ceiling bookcases.

               He tells us about his love of jazz and how he started writing 
               jazz reviews and music articles. He finds the first record 
               that he reviewed and puts it on his turntable. As the music 
               plays...

               Harvey talks about how he started buying and selling records.  
               This leads into how he first met ROBERT CRUMB.

               HARVEY (a little more hair but the exact same style) and a 
               bunch of his BUDDIES sift through old records at a junk sale.

</b>                         In the early sixties I was with some 
                         buddies at a junk sale looking for 
                         some choice sides when I met this

                         they made a movie about him, too.

               One of Harvey's pals -- MARTY -- pulls a record out of a 
               box.

               Harvey jumps up from his search to check out the LP.

               A skinny guy with a big nose, glasses and a ratty trench 
               coat taps Harvey on the shoulder. He is soft-spoken, a bit 
               shy and very odd -- a young ROBERT CRUMB.

               HARVEY marches back and forth holding Crumb's illustrated 
               comic novel. CRUMB sits on the floor nursing a beer and 
               sorting through vintage comic books. Harvey's bursting with 
               so much enthusiasm, it's almost aggressive.

               We see Crumb is actually sketching Harvey, slumped in a chair 
               reading a book. Crumb makes Harvey look like a smelly, sweaty 
               madman with ratty clothing.

               Crumb holds the sketch of Harvey up to show him.

                         with a Bohemian crowd. After a while, 
                         he got sick of greeting cards and

                         got the whole underground comic scene 
                         off the ground.

               On a sketch pad we see a deranged, tormented Harvey sitting 
               alone on a park bench. He pulls at his hair, and looks as 
               though he may murder the next person who walks by.

                         really feelin' bad. It was right 
                         around the time of my throat 
                         operation, an' right after my second 
                         wife left me. At first it was pretty 
                         weird. I mean, here my life was 
                         falling apart an' everything was 
                         going great for him. I was on my 
                         second divorce an' he was a big hit 
                         with the chicks. I was a nothin' 
                         file clerk and he was this famous 
                         cartoonist.

               HARVEY and R. CRUMB sit on a park bench together by a bus 
               stop. A distraught Harvey whines while Crumb just sketches.

               Harvey's voice is still raspy.

                         a' day. An' she married me an' 
                         everything, so I gotta give her some

                         anything like that, y'know?

               Crumb may or may not be listening to Harvey. It's hard to 
               tell.

                         "growth" crap. Everybody talks about

               For a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to 
               each other, each man in his own private universe.

               Finally Harvey looks over to Crumb.

               A hand reaches into the frame and opens the drawer.

               By rote, HARVEY fumbles with a large stack of "expired 
               patient" files. He places each into the appropriate 
               alphabetical "deceased" drawer.

               Attempting to grab another batch, Harvey accidentally knocks 
               the entire pile onto the floor.

               He crouches down to survey the mess -- a collage of "expired 
               lives" laid out before his eyes.

               We move past dozens of anonymous names -- William Anderson, 
               Louis Collins, Mark D'Amico, Tyrone Moore, Franklin Ray, 
               etc... Each file has a red "Deceased" stamp.

               Depressed, HARVEY is transfixed by the files surrounding him 
               on the floor. Suddenly he stops and picks one up.

               ANGLE ON FOLDER: It is marked, "CHARLIE MARSHALL."

               He opens the folder and reads the stats...

               ANGLE ON HARVEY: He swallows hard as he reads about Charlie's

               HARVEY sits at a table with a pen in hand and a blank sheet

               He flips through a pile of comic books -- everything from 
               D.C. Comic Super Heroes to underground works such as Crumb's 
               Mr. Natural and Zap Comix. No inspiration. Harvey throws

</b>
               HARVEY pushes a cart through the cramped aisles of a crowded 
               supermarket. He pulls a few cans of Beef-A-Roni off the shelf 
               and heads off to pay. Reaching the check-out area, he 
               evaluates the situation.

<b>               ANGLE ON CHECK-OUT COUNTERS:
</b>
               There are three lines to choose from. Two of the counters 
               have long waits. The third is much shorter but there is an 
               OLD JEWISH LADY next in line.

               The LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME remains Harvey at the supermarket 
               deliberating over the check-out lines.

               However, the RIGHT SIDE OF THE FRAME now contains a CRUMB 
<b>               STYLE COMIC PANEL DEPICTING THE EXACT SAME SCENARIO. A BUBBLE 
</b>               appears over CARTOON HARVEY'S head revealing his thoughts. 
               It reads: "Pickin' the right check-out line is an art... 
               There's a lot of things you gotta consider."

               ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... Harvey decides to get behind 
               the Old Lady.

               MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE FRAME... Cartoon 
               Harvey stands behind the Old Lady.

               A new BUBBLE reads: "It may be the shortest line but I am 
               takin' a chance 'cause she's an Old Jewish Lady."

               BACK TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... The CASHIER rings up 
               the Old Lady's purchases -- a few kitchen glasses.

               Harvey rolls his eyes and stamps his foot impatiently. He

               Cartoon Harvey now rants directly into the camera.

               The Human Harvey seems oblivious to his cartoon replica. He 
               impatiently leans on his cart, waiting and seething.

               ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN... The MANAGER finally 
               arrives. The Old Lady haggles with him, too.

               MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE... The Cartoon Harvey turns 
               to address the Human Harvey, who actually looks him in the 
               eyes. It now seems Human Harvey can actually hear his cartoon 
               alter ego.

               some spilled milk are a stack of papers covered with 
               scribbling. He clearly has been slaving over this work all

               At the top is a quickly scribbled title, "Standing Behind 
               Old Jewish Ladies In Supermarket Lines." These are ad hoc 
               versions of a comic book. The pages are divided like a tick-
               tack-toe board. Each square is filled with crude stick figure 
               drawings and lots of writing.

               An alarm clock goes off. Harvey's eyes fly open.

               Harvey yawns, then notices the pile of papers. He peruses 
               them, proud of his work. He gets up and looks out the window.

               It is yet another grey day in Cleveland. The neighborhood is 
               run-down. Garbage is strewn everywhere.

               The following scene unfolds through the window:

               Two UNSIGHTLY WORKERS lug an old, smelly mattress from a 
               garage towards the garbage cans on the curb. Their 
               conversation is distant, but entirely audible.

               They drop the mattress in place. With the window framing 
               these guys, the scene FREEZES, looking just like a comic 
               book panel.

               A tense HARVEY starts at CRUMB as he eats a burger and reads

</b>                         Sure. I don't see why not. You can't 
                         eat meat on certain days, but lentils 
                         should be acceptable anytime.

               Movie.

               ACTOR HARVEY steps out of the frame, revealing a craft service 
               table behind him. At the table, the REAL HARVEY and the REAL 
               TOBY load up on donuts. The two discuss the food on the set.

               Ironically, the Real Toby is actually more extreme than the 
               Actor who plays him -- even more robotic, and completely 
               incapable of eye-contact.

               The REAL TOBY discusses the finer points of nerdom and 
               evaluates the Actor's nerd quotient. The Real Harvey explains 
               to Actor Toby that nothing -- not even gourmet jelly beans -- 
               would have cheered him up at that point in his life.

               He was too lonely and depressed.

               She scans the crowd of friends, family, lovers and limo 
               drivers waiting to meet the disembarking passengers. Where 
               is Harvey? What will he look like?

               As Joyce surveys the unfamiliar faces, she imagines different 
               versions of an animated, illustrated Harvey among the people.

               She double-takes as sees the R. CRUMB HARVEY -- hairy, scary, 
               smelly and picking his nose. Joyce rubs her eyes.

               Next she sees the BRANDO HARVEY (Gary Dumm), but unfortunately 
               he disappears fast.

               Disappointed, Joyce notices the realistic DREW FRIEDMAN HARVEY

               before her -- not quite as bad as the Crumb version, not 
               quite as good as the Dumm version, but still acceptable. She

                         groups like PETA, but unfortunately 
                         I'm a self-diagnosed anemic. Also, I 
                         have all these food allergies to 
                         vegetables that give me serious

                         a lot of borderline health disorders 
                         that limit me politically when it

               JOYCE and HARVEY enter the apartment. The place is a mess, 
               as usual.

                         The truth is I got a serious problem 
                         with cleanliness. I could wash a 
                         dish ten times and it'd still dirty. 
                         They even kicked me outta the Army 
                         'cause I couldn't learn ta make a

               She slumps down on the sofa as if she's been here a million 
               times. She rubs her head. Harvey sits next to her.

               Harvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm. For some 
               reason, he's feeling more comfortable.

                         all your problems, you seem like a

                         turned out to be a real nasty bitch.

               Harvey arrives back with the aspirin. He hands it to Joyce.

               She pulls him close. Harvey plants a kiss on her.

               They slowly separate. Joyce's eyes are closed. She likes 
               him. He kisses her again. They start making out, moaning a 
               bit.

               But before it gets heavy --

               Joyce gets to her feet and puts her glasses back on. She 
               picks up a can and sprays air freshener around the room.

               Then she looks at the can and realizes it's WD-40.

               Joyce turns her head to the door. She's truly surprised by

               like usual, he seems to be floating on a cloud. We haven't

               He stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding 
               TOBY eating lunch alone. He has an entire White Castle

                         and act differently than other people. 
                         Like nerds might wear polyester button-
                         down shirts and flood pants where 
                         their ankles and their socks are 
                         showing.

               Toby spills some catsup on his polyester button-down shirt.

               He stands up to get a napkin, revealing his flood pants.

                         Yes, I consider myself a nerd. And 
                         this movie has uplifted me. There's 
                         this one scene where a nerd grabs 
                         the microphone during a pep rally 
                         and announces that he is a nerd and 
                         that he is proud of it and stands up 
                         for the rights of other nerds. Then, 
                         he asks the kids at the pep rally 
                         who think they are nerds to come 
                         forward... So nearly everyone in the 
                         place does. That's the way the movie 
                         ends.

               At a table in the foreground, BOB THE DIRECTOR discusses the 
               character of Joyce with the ACTRESS playing her. The actress 
               just nods as the director goes on.

               We can see THE REAL JOYCE sitting with THE REAL HARVEY in

</b>                         Okay, I think the thing with Joyce 
                         is that as manic as Harvey can be, 
                         she matches him with depression. In 
                         that way they complete each other. I 
                         mean, she's obviously a very smart 
                         woman, but she has a lot of trouble 
                         functioning in a world she can't 
                         control. And she's totally obsessed 
                         with all things negative; y'know, 
                         diseases, dysfuctions, etc.

               THE REAL JOYCE and REAL HARVEY listen curiously -- sometimes 
               pleased, sometimes displeased -- as their personalities are 
               dissected and boiled down to a few phrases.

               movie, and having a character arc imposed on her life.

               She moves into talking about her relationship with Harvey, 
               and the first years of their marriage -- how impossible it 
               was to live with him.

               Backstage, JOYCE watches LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN on 
               a monitor as HARVEY awaits his turn to go on camera. He has 
               changed out of his wrinkled T-shirt into a slightly more 
               formal look -- a denim shirt and a ratty seersucker striped 
               jacket.

               A LETTERMAN REGULAR (Tony Randall?) comes in with some food.

               He stops by the monitor to watch a moment with Joyce.

               The Letterman Regular takes a seat as he watches the monitor.

               He seems more intrigued than Joyce.

               This hits a sore spot. Harvey goes from politely condescending 
               to cantankerous in one second flat!

               Letterman cracks up. The Audience laughs even harder.

               The Audience can't believe this guy's holding his own with 
               Letterman.

               Joyce gives up. She sinks back into her seat and pulls a 
               book from her bag. The Letterman Regular stares at her like 
               she's from Mars.

               Alone and slumped over his table, HARVEY draws comic ideas 
               with stick figures. Nothing's coming to him. He looks like 
               he's in anguish.

               Frustrated, Harvey crumbles the idea and throws it on the 
               floor. He knocks over a chair.

               Without Joyce, a surly Harvey waits in the wings for his 
               introduction. He sneaks a peek as Letterman finishes up the

               Miserable and in a daze, HARVEY walks up to his front door.

               He looks like a man whose days are numbered. When he reaches

</b>                         My name is Harvey Pekar. It's an 
                         unusual name -- Harvey Pekar...

               As Harvey speaks, one-dimensional comic book images from his 
               life pass over the screen once again. This time in front of 
               him, behind him, everywhere. We dolly in towards him.

</b>                         1960 was the year I got my first 
                         apartment and my first telephone 
                         book. Imagine my surprise when I 
                         looked up my name and saw that, in 
                         addition to me, another Harvey Pekar 
                         was listed!

               Images of Harvey's childhood float by, followed by his young 
               adult years.

<b>                                     HARVEY
</b>                         I was listed as Harvey L. Pekar... 
                         My middle name is Lawrence... He was 
                         listed as Harvey Pekar -- no middle 
                         initial... Therefore, his was a purer 
                         listing.

               We see Harvey age in the images: he's hanging on the street 
               corner with friends, collecting records, hanging with Crumb.

</b>                         Then, in the seventies, I noticed 
                         that a third Harvey Pekar was listed 
                         in the phone book! This filled me 
                         with curiosity.

</b>                         How could there be three people with 
                         such an unusual name in the world, 
                         let alone in one city?!

               Now, numerous images of Harvey's many years at the V.A. 
               Hospital float by: Harvey filing, Harvey arguing with his 
               boss, Harvey and Toby, etc.

<b>                                     HARVEY
</b>                         Then one day, a person I worked with 
                         expressed her sympathy to me 
                         concerning what she thought was the 
                         death of my father. She pointed out 
                         an obituary notice in the newspaper 
                         for a man named Harvey Pekar. One of 
                         his sons was named Harvey. These 
                         were the other Harvey Pekars.

               The comic images fade out. Harvey is once again alone in the 
               empty room.

</b>                         Six months later, Harvey Pekar Jr. 
                         died. Although I'd met neither man, 
                         I was filled with sadness. "What 
                         were they like," I thought. It seemed 
                         that our lives had been linked in 
                         some indefinable way.

               We slowly move in on his face. Extremely close. As close as 
               the camera can get.

                         For two years later another Harvey 
                         Pekar appeared in the directory. 
                         What kind of people are these? Where 
                         do they come from, what do they do? 
                         What's in a name?

               JOYCE and a healthy-looking HARVEY sit at a table signing 
               copies of their opus. About fifteen or so people mill about 
               with copies.

                         an' the doctors are optimistic. I 
                         guess Joyce was right about doin' 
                         the big comic book. We published the 
                         thing as a graphic novel -- our first

</b>
               The place is still a mess but somehow it has a better vibe 
               than it had before. This might be due to the presence of 
               DANIELLE. She sits crossed legged on the floor making jewelry 
               out of beads. JOYCE guides her.

               HARVEY shuffles into the room. He watches for a moment as 
               Joyce and Danielle play.

               ANGLE ON JOYCE: There is an awkward expression almost 
               resembling a smile on her face. He interrupts them.

<b>                                     HARVEY
</b>                         Hey Joyce.

               Joyce looks up. Harvey looks like he's trying to hide 
               something.

               Joyce stops what she's doing and gulps. She hangs on Harvey's 
               every word.

               Tears well in Harvey's eyes. Joyce breathes a sigh of relief 
               and Danielle jumps up and runs over to Harvey. She hugs him.

               to ice skate.

               Harvey's got a box of pizza next to him. He picks up a slice 
               and chomps on it. The cheese drips out of his mouth onto his 
               shirt.
