              at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex-

              J.D. BANKS (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters
              the office.

                     o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his
                     drink on!
              J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.

                     once and for all.
              J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as
              the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.

<b>                                  BILLY

</b>                     Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other
                     women, I wouldn't even know what to do.
                     I've been out of the game so long.

              J.D. gets a big smile on his face.    He has an idea.

              Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to
              protest, J.D. steps forward...

                     With all the downsizing going on around
                     here, we wouldn't want to have to tell
                     Berenson that you've been slacking. He's
                     just dying to figure out who he should
                     fire next.

              BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk.

              The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE.

              the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy
              song kicks in.

              the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick
              in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it.
              When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats
              in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner.
              J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his
              car zooms out of the parking lot.

              aged, erudite, very professional). Kumar has NO ACCENT.
              He's American.

<b>                                  KUMAR
</b>                     Mononucleosis or mono is an infection
                     caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
                     Symptoms may include fever, sore throat,
                     headaches, white patches on the back of
                     your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness
                     and loss of appetite.

<b>                                  DR. WOODRUFF
</b>                     Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're
                     one of the best applicants I've ever
                     interviewed. Not that it's a surprise.
                     Your father is very respected in his
                     field. You know he and I had some pretty
                     wild times when we were in med school.

<b>                                  KUMAR
</b>                     Let's see. There might be epigastric
                     tenderness, diffuse abdominal
                     tenderness...
              Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a
              gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody
              smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls
              out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.

               Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he
               starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND.
               The jeep is loaded with "alternative" stickers, and has a
               KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof.
               Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car.

                HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl.

               is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a

               Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's
               Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the
               floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap
               posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a
               Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar
               is not in the room, however.

               Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA
               furnishings), where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN
               FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a "clipping sound"
               coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked
               and appalled. Harold walks inside...

               more snips. On the floor, we see LARGE CLUMPS OF HAIR.

               inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with marijuana.
               Kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy.

               care. He lets it ring until the answering machine picks up.

<b>               GOING ON BETWEEN A BUNCH OF HUGE BLACK DUDES, RIGHT IN THE

               The BASKETBALL PLAYERS briefly look over at Harold's Infiniti
               before continuing their game.

          Kumar points to a sign indicating that the HIGHWAY is ahead.

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 Forget about it. No way.

</b>                 Come on. How do you know they're not
                 peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys?
          With that, the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN OF ALL TIME ROARS AS
          HE COMPLETES A MONSTER DUNK. In celebration, he violently
          bumps chests with his teammates.

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 Turn the car around.

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 Why? Are cars not allowed to go through
                 when a game's going on? When we were
                 kids, we used to move to the side when we
                 were playing in the street.
          The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 For some reason, I don't think this is

</b>                 I'm going through.
          KUMAR begins inching forward.

<b>                                HAROLD
</b>                 Don't!
          The BASKETBALL PLAYERS slowly begin moving aside.

<b>                                KUMAR
</b>                 Look.    They're moving.   I told you.
          Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar,
          they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all
          times. Harold is scared shitless. He then notices the
          HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN holding the basketball.

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us.

                 I've been an employee here for three
                 years now, and if there's one thing I've
                 learned, it's that when you're craving
                 White Castle, the burgers here simply
                 won't cut it.
                        (in his own little world)
                 In fact, just thinking about those tender
                 little White Castle burgers and those
                 grilled onions makes me want to burn this
                 place to the ground and re-build a White
                 Castle in its place.
                        (back to reality)
                 If I were you, I'd suck it up and make
                 the trip.
          KUMAR looks at HAROLD. The guy makes a convincing case.
          HAROLD is clearly torn. We sense that this is an important
          moment for the guys...

                 not ending this night without White
                 Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?
          KUMAR puts his hand out.   HAROLD shakes it.

               DOZEN ASIAN STUDENTS-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy

               Kumar hands Harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens
               and a SECURITY GUARD enters the hall. He sees HAROLD and
               KUMAR with drugs.

               BACK SEAT. HAROLD doesn't see this.

<b>          62   EXT. BUSH NEAR DARK ROAD                                     62
</b>               KUMAR is still peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY (FROM OUT OF
               NOWHERE) walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips his pants
               and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR!
               Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused. The
               Creepy Guy simply goes about his business. It's clear that
               Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple
               seconds, until he can't take it anymore...

<b>                                   KUMAR
</b>                      Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask
                      you...why are you peeing here?

<b>                                   CREEPY GUY

</b>                      Why did you decide to piss here right
                      next to me? Why not that bush over there?

<b>                                   CREEPY GUY
</b>                      Well, this looked like a good bush to pee
                      on. Why'd you choose this bush?

<b>                                   KUMAR
</b>                      Nobody was here when I chose this bush.

<b>                                   CREEPY GUY
</b>                             (getting heated)
                      So you can pee here and nobody else can,
                      is that it?

<b>                                   KUMAR
</b>                      I was just saying....

<b>                                   CREEPY GUY
</b>                      Is this like your special bush or
                      something?

<b>                                    KUMAR
</b>                      No, I just...
                             (beat)
                      You know what? Forget about it. I'm not
                      in the mood to get stabbed right now.
               The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate
               next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy
               Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package.

                 I hope you are here to apologize for what
                 you did in your interview today. Dr.
                 Woodruff is a very good friend of mine,
                 and let's just say he was not at all
                 amused by your antics...and neither am I.

                 Look at me. I own my own house. I drive a

                 can't hear what you're saying? He's two
                 feet away from us. He can hear this

          HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then
          looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard
          a thing. Harold seems relieved.

          know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact
          that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.

                        something to drink, watch tv-- anything
                        you want. Mi casa es su casa. Just
                        don't do anything Jesus wouldn't do.
               FREAK SHOW gives HAROLD a pat on the back and starts changing
               the tire. KUMAR and HAROLD look at each other. Slowly, they
               walk towards FREAK SHOW's house...

                        sentence, but it was still clear as day.
               They reach the front door and are about to enter...

               TIME (LIANE) walk out of the kitchen. She is dressed Daisy
               Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.

               HAROLD and KUMAR can't move.   They're awestruck.

               LIANE   leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she
               turns   on a record player, which starts playing a CREEPY SONG
               ABOUT   JESUS CHRIST. HAROLD and KUMAR look around the house.
               There   are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with
               Freak   Show and Liane's wedding picture...

          drinks and hands them the glasses...

</b>                 Well, I met him at choir practice `bout
                 four years ago. Freak Show was very shy
                 back then-- you know, because of all the
                 hideous boils on his face and neck. But
                 he had the most amazing voice -- like a
                 baby canary.
          Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we
          talking about the same Freakshow?"

<b>                              LIANE
</b>                 Well, one day after Easter service, I
                 told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and
                 he just mustered up some courage and
                 asked me out. The rest is history. And
                 we've been in love ever since.
          HAROLD ponders this for a moment.    He and KUMAR begin
          drinking their lemonade.

<b>                              LIANE
</b>                 So you boys gonna fuck me or what?
          HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They
          look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold.

          Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and

          where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy.

          Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous
          and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and
          puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar,
          who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the
          cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her
          shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her
          breasts.

<b>                              LIANE
</b>                        (to Harold, re: breasts)

</b>                 Okay, let's do that.
          Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts.
          Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold
          starts to massage her chest.
          AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a

<b>                                   HAROLD
</b>                      Hey, you don't know how to get back on
                      the highway, do you?

</b>                      I don't even know where the fuck I am
                      right now. I was at this party earlier
                      tonight, and this dude hooked me up with
                      some killer X. Somehow I ended up
                      getting thrown out of a moving car, and
                      I've been tripping balls ever since.

                      trying to get to White Castle, but we

                      is some pussy.

                      go to White Castle.

               NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start
               walking over to the CONVENIENCE STORE.

               Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk
               into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them...

               HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS
               SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests...

          Cole and the Punks ignore him.    Harold and Kumar then
          approach the Indian Cashier...

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get
                 onto the highway from here?
          The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                        (to Harold)
                 He probably can't speak English...

<b>          KUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE
</b>          CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the
          directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to
          explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It
          sounds like it's very complicated.
          Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO
          MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK
          AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store.
          Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the
          CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches
          nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK...

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 Who knew that learning Hindi would
                 actually pay off? The guy says the
                 highway's just down the road. We should
                 be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes.
          HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS...

          look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY

</b>          In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid-
          air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS,

          and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief.

          with his friends.

                    point five.
          Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy
          throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves,
          bothering other customers.
          The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI.
          Extreme   Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of
          various   kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an
          other.    Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS.
          He goes   apeshit over his find.

          He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth,
          getting the chips all over the place.
          The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling.      Cole picks up the
          Cashier...

          around and around.

          Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the

          their asses kicked.

               Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face.
               Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior.
               It's a tense moment.
               Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit
               Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground
               without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks
               don't know what to think as their leader is shown up.
               Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as
               if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back,
               doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard,
               this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling...

               Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated.   With their
               leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating.

</b>                 You know, pressing the button a bunch of
                 times doesn't make the sign change any
                 faster. The computer responds to the
                 first press. Every press after that is
                 extraneous.

</b>                 Thank you, Mr. Wizard.

                 understand urgency?
          The "DON'T WALK" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the
          left and then to the right. The street is completely empty
          and there is no place for a police car to hide.

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 This is ridiculous.   Just walk across.

          They stand there for another ten seconds.   It doesn't change.

                 I'll cross. Just leave me alone!
          Harold starts walking angrily across the street.

               towards him.

                      But then graduation came, and we went to
                      college and you went nowhere, so you
                      thought, "How can I still give them shit?

                      congratulations. Your dream's come true.
               Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed.
               Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to

               up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!!

          Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him
          is a black man (TARIK) sitting down, reading a book. Harold
          sits down, across from Tarik.
          While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the
          cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it.

</b>                 I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble,
                 and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black
                 man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore,
                 since I'm black, it was probably me,
                 right?
          Harold shrugs his shoulders.

<b>                              TARIK
</b>                 Well that was the logic the cop used. I
                 told him I haven't even been to Newark in
                 months. Then he pointed a gun at me and
                 told me to stop resisting arrest. I
                 said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything."
                 So he starts beating me with his gun,
                 screaming at me, telling me to stop
                 resisting.

<b>                               HAROLD
</b>                 Holy shit.   What did you do?

<b>                              TARIK

                 under arrest. Please stop beating me."
                 But that didn't work. Then another cop
                 showed up. Then another. When it was
                 all said and done, it took nine cops to
                 bring me in here.

                 And I have two gay fathers. I've had

                and start heading towards a FOREST.

</b>                       Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking

                       from being broke to being millionaires.
                Suddenly, they hear what sounds like A COYOTE'S HOWL.

                 take a coyote down.

          The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 We're gonna die.

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to
                 eating zebras and shit. They're not
                 known for eating humans.

<b>          WITH THAT, THE CHEETAH WALKS OVER TO A NEARBY BUSH AND DRAGS
</b>

                 But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll
                 probably leave us alone.
          HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins

          Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON

<b>                              HAROLD

          Eventually, he calms down and looks at the CHEETAH.

                HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't
                been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins
                licking Harold's face in friendship.

</b>                Harold and Kumar are now sitting on top of the CHEETAH,
                smoking joints. Kumar has a belt around the cheetah's neck
                like reigns on a horse.

                plays as HAROLD and MARIA skip through THE LAND OF BURGERS,

                KUMAR and the MALE NURSE, who are playing Twister, while
                getting high. After a spin of the wheel, Kumar reluctantly         
                gets in a position where it looks like he's taking the Male
                Nurse from behind. Kumar's not happy.
                Harold and Maria fall to the ground-- they roll down a hill,
                UNTIL HAROLD IS ON TOP OF MARIA. Harold picks up a burger
                from the ground. Maria does the same. They proceed to feed
                each other their burgers. They munch on them, looking into
                each other's eyes...

                 COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS are hacky-sacking in the
                 parking lot. Their skateboards are sitting nearby.

                 Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something
                 through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and
                 points...

                 Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside,
                 sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five
                 cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down...
                 Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY
                 FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first
                 bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT.
                 HAROLD and KUMAR watch through the window longingly...

          Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein.
          Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of
          donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are "an item."

          Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head
          by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold.

          Cole gets in the CRANE POSITION a la THE KARATE KID...
          Harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at Cole's little

</b>                        No. No way. Not a chance.       I'd rather

                 Just hold onto the outside bars and let

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 No, Kumar. I'm not risking my life over
                 a bunch of hamburgers.
          KUMAR walks over to HAROLD and stares him in the eye...

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 You think this just about the burgers,
                 huh? Well, let me tell you-- it's about
                 far more than that.
          KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto
          the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The
          scene is very picturesque...

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 Our parents came to this country,
                 escaping persecution, poverty, and
                 hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very,
                 very hungry. And they wanted to live in
                 a land that treated them as equals. A
                 land where their kids could study and get
                 into good colleges. A land filled with
                 hamburger stands. And not just one type
                 of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with
                 different sizes, toppings, and
                 condiments. That land was America.

<b>          THE POLICE SIREN IS GETTING LOUDER...

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                        (turning to Rold)
                 You think this is just about the burgers?
                 No. This is about achieving what our
                 parents set out for. This is about the
                 pursuit of happiness. This is about the
                 American dream.
          KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.

<b>                               KUMAR
</b>                 And so we've reached this point. The
                 point which all men eventually have to
                 face. The point of no return.
                        (beat)
                 We can stay here, get arrested and end
                 our hopes of ever going to White Castle.
                 Or we can take the hang-glider and make
                 our leap towards freedom. I leave the
                 decision up to you.
          From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are
          getting closer. Harold turns back, facing Kumar...

                 inside. He notices THE BAG OF WEED ON THE DASHBOARD. He
                 opens it and TASTES SOME WEED in the same way a drug cop
                 would taste cocaine during a bust.

                        Good news. I found enough dope in the
                        car to send those skateboard punks to
                        jail for the next couple years. Looks
                        like they've terrorized their last
                        convenience store.
                 Suddenly, Officer Brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth
                 is strangely appealing. He thinks for a beat as he eyes the
                 bag of weed. He then takes another taste of it. He looks
                 again at the bag. Like Kumar, we can tell that he's in
                 love...

<b>                HAROLD TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND THEN KNOCKS ON THE DOOR...

<b>                A GOOD-LOOKING, MUSCULAR HISPANIC MAN (LUIS) IS STANDING

                 She seemed so sweet at first, but it
                 turns out she's into some pretty freaky
                 shit. She even did this thing where she
                 took a lollipop and shoved it...

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                        (grossed out/depressed)
                 Look, I really don't need to hear it. I
                 guess I just made a mistake. Sorry for
                 interrupting you guys...
          Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING
          MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY. Kumar feels sorry for his friend.
          Just then, Luis leans his head out the door...

<b>                              LUIS
</b>                 Hey-- if you're looking for Maria, she
                 left for Europe this morning.
          Harold quickly turns around and runs back over.

<b>                               HAROLD
</b>                 Huh?

<b>                              LUIS
</b>                 She's going to Amsterdam for ten days.
                 I'm Luis -- Maria's brother.
          Luis shakes Harold's hand.    Harold suddenly feels better.

<b>                                HAROLD
</b>                 Oh!    Maria's brother!

<b>                              LUIS
</b>                 You must be that Chinese guy Maria keeps
                 talking about.

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 Actually, I'm Kor...wait a second-- she
                 talks about me?
          A HOT BLACK CHICK (AISHA), wearing only a bra and g-string,
          walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him...

<b>                              AISHA
</b>                 Are you coming or what?

<b>                              LUIS
</b>                 Hey, I'll be there in a second, baby. Do
                 me a favor-- make me that omelette you
                 were talking about. You know, with the
                 sun-dried tomatoes.
          Aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen. Luis gives
          her a little a slap on the ass. Harold doesn't quite know
          how to respond to this.

<b>                              LUIS
</b>                 Then take it easy, hermano.
          Luis shuts the door.    Kumar runs over to Harold...

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 Dude...we gotta go!

<b>                                 HAROLD

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 To Amsterdam! We can pack up right now
                 and take the next plane.

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 What are you talking about? Are you out
                 of your mind? What about your interview
                 with the med school guy?

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule
                 it. He won't have a problem, as long as
                 I'm taking it seriously for a change.
                 Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria!

<b>                              HAROLD
</b>                 She's coming back in ten days! It's not
                 like I'm never gonna see her again.

<b>                              KUMAR
</b>                 For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is
                 the kiss of death. There are gonna be
                 suave, sophisticated guys all over her.
                 By the time she gets back, she may not be
                 available.
          Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying.

<b>                               HAROLD
</b>                 Forget it.   I'll just wait till she comes
                 back.
          Harold starts to walk away from Kumar...

<b>                               KUMAR
