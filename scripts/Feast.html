<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               EXT. DESERT -- DAY
</b>
               The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a 
               cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.

               Far in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its 
               way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES 
               perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.

<b>               EXT. DESERT -- DAY
</b>
               The truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching 
               coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky, 
               weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut 
               and naive).

               Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth 
               before them.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         This is it.

<b>                                     LANKY
</b>                         Why did it have to be these caves...

<b>                                     COLLEGE BOY
</b>                         Is something wrong?

<b>                                     LANKY
</b>                              (to College Boy)
                         Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'.

               Chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck.

               The logo on the rear gate reads "WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT." 

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         Let's get that first barrel.

               The gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS 
               bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol.

<b>               INT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER
</b>
               College Boy and Lanky steer a cart loaded with the first 
               barrel inside. Chief's lone beam of light leads the men.

<b>                                     COLLEGE BOY
</b>                         What's with the awkward silence?

<b>                                     LANKY
</b>                         You don't know?

               College Boy shakes his head "no" and they set the cart down.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         Last winter, a man kidnapped a little 
                         girl and holed up in one of these 
                         caves. The cops had him pinned down 
                         and began to move in. This guy started 
                         shooting... but he wasn't aiming at 
                         the officers...
                              (getting closer)
                         ...he was firing at something inside.

               College Boy is rapt.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         When the dust cleared, all they found 
                         was the little girl's shoes.
                              (beat)
                         With the feet still in 'em.

               Something GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump.

<b>                                     COLLEGE BOY
</b>                         Ahh!!!

               Lanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The 
               two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed.

<b>                                     COLLEGE BOY
</b>                         Assholes.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself 
                         when my boss pulled that one on me.

<b>                                     LANKY
</b>                         I went well beyond nearly.

               Then, a sound. All eyes turn.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         What was that?

<b>                                     COLLEGE BOY
</b>                         Once was plenty, fellas.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         Shhhh...

               As Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe.

               Instantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A 
               group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, 
               CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams.

               MEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched 
               a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around 
               her neck. She charges towards Chief.

<b>                                     MEAN GREEN
</b>                         Stop it right there! You will not 
                         rape Mother Nature one more day!

               Panicked, Chief drops his pick-axe and stumbles back.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

               In unison, the hippies start CHANTING.

<b>                                     HIPPIE GROUP

                         more...

               A BEARDED CAMERAMAN with a huge KEY RING on his belt, films 
               the whole event. The three men are stopped in their tracks.  

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         Take it easy! We have a permit!

<b>                                     MEAN GREEN
</b>                              (handing a document)
                         And we have an injunction from the 
                         State to prevent any dumping in these 
                         caverns! This is virgin land! The 
                         aqueducts in these caves bring 
                         drinking water to our families, and 
                         its piping provides drainage for our 
                         farms that enrich this barren land! 
                         And it won't be tainted by waste of 
                         any kind! Not now! Not ever!

               Chief, shaken, confirms the injunction and hands it back.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         Fine, just back off!

               He snaps his fingers, motioning to the barrel.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         Let's roll... Now-now-now!

               Backing away, looking to Mean Green.

<b>                                     CHIEF
</b>                         How do you guys always know where 
                         we're going?

<b>                                     MEAN GREEN
</b>                              (with a smirk)
                         I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!

               Hastily, the men roll the barrel out of the cave.

<b>                                     MEAN GREEN
</b>                         Score one for the green team!!!

               The hippies let out a spirited cheer. One pulls out a 
               tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in 
               the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their 
               truck and peel away.

<b>                                     BEARDED CAMERAMAN
</b>                         Hey, man, that was righteous, but I 
                         need a shot with the sign up.

               At the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves 
               to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall.

<b>                                     MEAN GREEN
</b>                         We saved you today, ol' gal.

               Fuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach 
               in the rock wall.

<b>                                     FUZZY
</b>                         Oh, fuck!

<b>                                     MEAN GREEN
</b>                         Sister, why do you always swing for 
                         the fences?

<b>                                     FUZZY
</b>                              (eyeing breach)
                         It's okay, but I... I think I see 
                         something in there... something shiny.

               Fuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look. The 
               rest of the hippie-chain moves in closer.

<b>                                     FUZZY
</b>                         Oh my, it looks like diamonds!

               CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull. 
               Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies.

               Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach.

               Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles 
               forward.

               Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't.

               One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death.

               Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls.

               Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.

<b>                                     MEAN GREEN
</b>                         Give me the keys!!!

               Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing 
               both his arms.

               Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She 
               HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.

               Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she 
               BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.

               She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her 
               fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. 
               She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!

               Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness. 
               The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light. 
               As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK...

               Neon light flashes UNITED NATIONS TAVERN. Laughing and music 
               emanates. Besides the bar, there's nothing around for miles.

               A 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle 
               on the hood pulls up. The rear bumper sticker reads "MY OTHER

               A weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from

               Bozo passes a man dressed in a cheap suit and standing well

               behind the bar. Freeze on him.

                         long and then... bang! She drops me. 
                         Since then, it's been like a damn 
                         country song: she's gone, the car's 
                         repossessed, and a father figure 
                         made a pass at me. I'm not saying I 
                         ever had it. But I have definitely 
                         lost it.

                         Now I haul this swill from armpit to 
                         armpit. I used to be a model for 
                         Christ's sake.

               Grandpa Beast's head has large red eyeballs and a mouth full

               Hero's right half is JERKED outside through the window.

               Blood sprays. Rapid chomping. CRASH! The double doors are 
               kicked open, splintering the propped up chair.

               HEROINE (Native American, rugged, ripped pants, wickedly 
               hot) rushes in, slams the doors shut and instinctively kicks 
               up the RUST RED SHOTGUN. She flips it sideways and slides 
               the metal weapon through the handles of the double doors, 
               securing them.

               BAM! A massive HIT slams into the doors from the outside 
               sending Heroine SLIDING across the floor.

               She SPRINGS to her feet and drives her weight into a table 
               attempting to hoist it over the now open window.

               A BEAST nails the rising table, just missing Heroine's face.

               The table falls, pinning Heroine.

               JUNIOR BEAST enters. He's small and too fast to see well.

               He SWIPES the heads off Old Vet and Harley Mom. Bartender 
               grabs The Judge, but he's SCRATCHED down the back.

               Junior Beast rips out the pay phone. Knocks over the TV.

               Yanks out half of Trampy's hair.

               Edgy Cat CHARGES the spastic monster with a stool.

               Edgy Cat misses. Junior Beast sends him FLYING into a wall.

               BLAM! BLAM! Bartender FIRES The Judge at the creature hitting 
               lights instead. An errant shot destroys Edgy Cat's face.

               Para covers as Junior Beast RIPS the back of his wheelchair.

               Roadie WHACKS Junior Beast with a chair. Stunned, it flies 
               across the room, landing in a metal ICE COOLER.

               Bozo SLAMS it closed, capturing Junior Beast.

               Roadie power lifts the table with Heroine and braces it 
               against the window for reinforcement, but a FURRY ARM busts 
               through and grabs the other half of Hero.

               Blood starts to SPRAY from outside as the rest of Hero is 
               being devoured through the smallish hole.

               Heroine works a GOLD RING off of Hero's ring finger. The 
               feeding MOMMA BEAST'S head breaks in through the hole. It 
               grabs Heroine's left forearm.

               SCREECHES and jerks back, dragging the rest of Hero outside.

               Heroine clutches the ring. Shrieks and flapping wings are 
               heard outside. They dissipate. A moment of calm.

               Belle timidly holds the receiver of the busted pay phone.

               The other patrons emerge from under tables and other hiding 
               spaces in various states of shock. Junior Beast has

               There is a HOLLER at the top of the stairs. Everyone turns.

</b>                         Nah, I got the gun.

               Boss Man hobbles down the stairs with the help of Tuffy. His 
               foot is a bloody mess. He is holding a .38.

               Boss Man squints skeptically. Adulterer points to GRANDPA 
               BEAST'S HEAD on the bar.

                         oldest of the bunch, looked like the 
                         Grandpa. We caught the little one, 
                         Junior, in the cooler there. As we've 
                         seen, what he lacks in size he more 
                         than makes up for in speed.

                         still outside.

               NOTE: As Heroine describes each beast, we see a slight glimpse 
               of their virtues, hidden mainly by shadows and fog.

</b>                         The next one is taller, but all out 
                         of proportion. Like a "teen beast."

<b>               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT
</b>
               TEEN BEAST has a big head and awkward body. He clumsily moves 
               and seems uncomfortable in his own skin.

</b>                         He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly 
                         just the same.

               Heroine tends to her scratched arm.

<b>               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT
</b>
               MOMMA BEAST flashes out from the dark. She's shorter than 
               Teen, but much wider. She has a big mouth and NATIONAL 
               GEOGRAPHIC BOOBS that hang down to her waist. She covers her 
               stabbed right eye and SCREECHES.

<b>               INT. BAR -- NIGHT
</b>
               Heroine taps her right eye.

               The entire bar stares at Heroine with their mouths agape.

                         account for.

               Tuffy BURSTS through the door. Cody sits by the TV, unmoved.

               Tuffy pulls Cody into her arms. Heroine and Bartender halt 
               to guard the doorway. Heroine spots a SMALL PORTAL WINDOW.

               SMASH! Papa Beast BURSTS through the portal window and RIPS 
               Cody's torso from Tuffy's grasp. Tuffy holds his DANGLING 
               ARMS. Blood sprays everywhere.

               Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa 
               Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window.

               Bartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast 
               projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender.

               Papa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the 
               wood shutters closed.

               Tuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like, 
               to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's 
               bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut.

               He hands him a towel. Tuffy slowly walks towards the rest of 
               the patrons. The blood on her face and chest tells them what 
               happened. The horror hits home.

               Heroine eyes the destroyed phone.

                         Is that the only phone?

               Bartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic

               Adulterer, violently grabs Heroine to shove her away.

               Heroine nails Adulterer with THREE HITS to the chin, throat 
               and chest, flipping him to the floor. She pulls a KNIFE from 
               her belt buckle and has it under Adulterer's chin.

               Adulterer nods obediently. Heroine removes the knife from 
               his neck and plants it back into her buckle.

               Adulterer takes his seat. He looks over at the half bald 
               Trampy. She looks at him, hurt.

               At the bar, Bozo puts the TV back into place, he jiggles 
               with some wires in the back, bringing back the picture.

               The bar takes notice. Trampy, cell phone in hand, paws through 
               a phone book as she watches the broadcast.

               ON TV: There is an awkward pause from the Newscaster. The 
               broadcast doesn't cut to the reporter.

               Unlike humans, Papa Beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts 
               all of thirty seconds. Momma Beast's belly balloons up and

               BOOM! Grandpa Beast LANDS on the front hood of the Camaro.

               Heroine and Hero SCREAM and rev the engine, swerving madly 
               as Grandpa Beast VOMITS on the windshield.

               The car crashes into a ditch, DECAPITATING Grandpa Beast.

               His head FIRES through the windshield, landing on Heroine's

               Roadie kicks open the door and FIRES at the Sisters. They 
               dive back out of the room screeching.

               Right behind Bozo, the boards fly off the portal window.

               Papa Beast flies at Bozo. Bozo spins and aimlessly FIRES his 
               shotgun, hitting Papa Beast directly in the groin.

               The door flies open. Bozo is YANKED to safety just as Papa 
               STRIKES the closing door.

               The patrons track the wild CRASHING and HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING 
               sounds of Papa Beast. He finally breaks out of the upstairs. 
               Beer Guy and Roadie carry Boss Man into the room as Coach, 
               Bartender, Heroine and the shaken Bozo creep down the stairs.  
               Bozo slowly takes a seat in his brother's lap.

               promptly shushed by Boss Man. Heroine notices.

               Heroine, Roadie, and Coach make their way through the 
               basement. Creeks and cracks with every step.

                         You handle yourself pretty well. You 
                         a cop or a criminal?

                         daughter... and the rest is easy.

               The light casts a shadow of something BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

               Roadie moves to open the curtain with his sawed-off barrel.

               WHIP! The curtain slides. It's a dried animal hide on a hook. 
               They all sigh. Roadie unblocks the tiny door.

               Heroine scans the room.

               Coach's hand shakes as he raises his weapon.

                         On three.

               Roadie, Heroine raise their weapons.

               Roadie whips open the door. Nothing.

               BANG-GONG-GONG! Some pipes CRASH to the ground next to them... 
               they jump, but nothing is there. A LITTLE MOUSE emerges from 
               the fallen heap.

</b>                         Well, look at that.

               Coach leans down and puts out his hand. He smiles as Heroine 
               watches over his shoulder.

               He leaves the mouse and follows Heroine to the tunnel.

               SLURP! A pink tongue LASSOS the mouse.

               A red fluorescent glow radiates from the tunnel. They all 
               drop in, one by one, entering the steamy, confined space.

               Tuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for 
               movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.

               Bozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand.

               The tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry 
               red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh 
               marijuana plants are along the ground soil. There are thick 
               pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering 
               system. There is about six inches of water on the floor.

               Bozo looks to Trampy, putting an arm around her shoulder.

               Roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The 
               tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down.

               A SCRATCHING sound is heard from above.

               The scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end 
               of the tunnel as well.

               Then, Sister Beast #1 drops into the tunnel from the far 
               end.

               She charges. At the last second, Roadie spots her.

               Roadie and Coach duck into the water, but Heroine is unable 
               to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. Sister 
               Beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey. Roadie aims 
               his water-dripping gun, but Heroine rises and blocks his 
               shot.

               From her knees, Heroine fires. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The three 
               shots push Sister Beast #1 backwards. Heroine rises, covered 
               in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face.

<b>                                     HEROINE

               Roadie and Coach reluctantly turn, leaving Heroine to fend 
               with the Beast.

               Heroine charges. Hissing, Sister Beast #1 charges as well.

               Heroine pumps and fires. BOOM! Sister Beast spins, avoiding 
               the shot. Now too close, Heroine jams the Beast in the mouth 
               with the gun, knocking her back.

               Sister Beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm.

               Heroine bats her away. Sister Beast #1 moves to the others.

               Roadie and Coach sprint until Sister Beast #2 BURSTS through 
               the tunnel walls, stopping Roadie and Coach in their tracks.

               Roadie fires his weapon, but it sparks and fizzles.

               Grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling, Roadie pulls 
               himself from the water. Coach uses the machete to cut a power 
               cord from above. He grabs the exposed, sparking end.

               Heroine sees what he's doing, sprints back the way they came.

               As the two Beasts charge, Coach pulls himself out of the 
               water by holding onto the above piping. He's forced to wait 
               for Heroine to get out of the water.

               The second she does, he jams the cord into the water.

               ZAP! The conductive water sizzles. Sister Beast #1 and Sister 
               Beast #2 lock up and crash. ELECTROCUTION. Sparks and smoke 
               rises from their cooked bodies.

               Roadie and Coach look to each other, victorious. They begin 
               shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel.

               Heroine looks back at the two men. She turns and reenters 
               the basement.

               GAH! Teen Beast drops in front of her, whacking her to the 
               floor. Heroine slides across the floor, but jumps up quickly. 
               Teen Beast cautiously moves in for the kill.

               Heroine THROWS the shotgun at him and pulls out the MACHETE.

               She rolls left and swings. Teen Beast loses two fingers.

               She swings again but gets whacked to the floor.

               Heroine rolls with the hit, grabs her shotgun, and dives 
               into the KEG ELEVATOR.

               She slams closed the door as Teen Beast regains its composure

               Para crawls to his fallen wheelchair. Teen Beast spots him, 
               moves in to feed.

               with no front teeth, he can't do immediate damage.

               Tuffy reaches back and shoves her fist into Papa Beast's 
               mouth, jamming it down his throat. He instantly gags, sucking 
               for air.

               Papa Beast struggles to get free, but the others hold tight.

               Papa Beast's body begins to quiver from a lack of oxygen.

               His eyes widen, face to face with Tuffy.

               With one last lunge, Papa Beast shakes, his life drifting 
               away. His eyes turn black as his body goes limp. Tuffy pulls 
               out her arm from his throat.

               Tuffy shakes her wet arm dry. As the group pulls away, Papa 
               Beast is still pinned to the wall with the deer antlers dug 
               into the wood.

               Heroine turns to Grandma and Grandpa, offering a hand.

               Heroine swallows and nods. HONK-HONK-HONK! Just outside the 
               breached wall, the beer truck pulls up.

               The beer truck screeches to a halt. Trampy's at the wheel, 
               waving the group over. With the bar burning, a thick layer 
               of SMOKE blankets the entire area.

               The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from 
               advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent.

               From the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull.

               At the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in, 
               leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering 
               the back.

               Heroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She

               Momma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg 
               door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap, 
               Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors.

               Beer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck.

               The others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt 
               and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with 
               Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails 
               to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck.

               silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine.

               Then, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK!

               A deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck.

               It's Momma Beast. Again and again.

               Heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the 
               truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the

               Instantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of 
               the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped. 
               The group gasps. Trampy backs away.

               UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box 
               of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar. 
               From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma 
               Beast emerges.

               The Beasts spring into action, chasing the group.

               Bozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast 
               RIPS Para from Bozo's back.

               behind, continually looking over his shoulder.

               Heroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck. She finds a 
               pack of cigs under the visor. Pops in the lighter.

               Moment of silence as Adulterer and Tuffy look down the

               The car peels off. Adulterer watches the car tear down the 
               road. He glances up at the RISING SUN.

               The car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They

               kneels against his car.

               The group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond

               In the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE 
               stands staring at them.

               Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets 
               awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress.

               As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm.

               The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her 
               ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, 
               the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.

               The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast 
               HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to 
               right, panic stricken.

<b>                                     CHARLIE

               The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something 
               is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but 
               Adulterer holds her at bay.

</b>                         It's a trap!

               At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the 
               distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them.

               Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for 
               Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole 
               cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.

               The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting 
               Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.

               Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.

               Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store 
               front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him 
               towards her main prey. 

               A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the 
               survivors. At the store front, Heroine pulls Charlie close.

               A string of ten WHITE VANS come to a halt in the dusty parking 
               lot. THE MAN IN TAN (45, buzz cut, leathery skin, cool) steps 
               from the lead van and surveys the ravaged small town.

               A swarm of men emerge from the other vehicles, all dressed

               The place is torn to hell. Dust and soot hangs in the air.

               The men instinctively raise their high-powered rifles, letting 
               the flashlights on the ends lead the way. They follow the 
               trail of blood to a back FREEZER LOCKER.

               As the dust clears, Tuffy, Heroine and Charlie stare back at

</b>                         A trauma center. We have doctors 
                         waiting.
                              (off Heroine's pause)
                         You're in good hands now.

               The door shuts on Heroine's concerned face. The Man in Tan 
               locks eyes with the Driver.

               The Driver nods back. Sinister implication understood.

               The Man in Tan lights a cigarette as he watches the truck 
               drive off. The truck's logo reads, "FARM-AID." He inhales.

               Freeze on him.
