    We hear a strange, single, BENT NOTE.


<b>1   EXT. SHARECROPPER SHACK - ECU FINGERS - LATE AFTERNOON        1
</b>    We follow a small boy's FINGERS on a strange contraption-


<b>    WIDER
</b>
    SCRATCH, 10 years old, has a `DIDDLEY BOW', a piece of baling
    wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is
    stretched taut. He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret
    and makes TWANGY, pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire.

    His friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he
    has laid on the side of the porch floor. A few scrawny
    CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them-

<b>                        LONNIE
</b>              Leave off with that, Scratch.

<b>                        SCRATCH
</b>              Aint bothering you.

<b>                           LONNIE
</b>              Yes it is.     That aint no kind of
              music.

    We see that the board has PIANO KEYS drawn across it and that
    Lonnie is pretending to play a song on it-

<b>                        SCRATCH
</b>              Least I make a sound.

<b>                        LONNIE
</b>              Yeah and it's a nasty one.

    Lonnie looks at the sky-

<b>                        SCRATCH
</b>              You want to try again tonight?

    Lonnie sits on the edge of the porch, gauging the time from
    the setting sun-

<b>                        LONNIE
</b>              Might as well.


<b>2   EXT. 1ST COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON                        2
</b>    SLIDE GUITAR plays. A tuft of RAW COTTON bobs on the stem
    and we begin to scroll OPENING CREDITS-
<b>                                                              2.
</b>


    We TILT and RACK to look over a FIELD OF COTTON, the bolls
    plumped out and ready for picking, blowing in the breeze.

    A HARVEST HAND steps into the shot, looks toward the setting
    sun, wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the
    row in front of him. We PULL BACK to see other PICKERS, men
    and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard
    work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing
    LONG WHITE SACKS between their legs and behind them.

    The boys walk down between them in the opposite direction-


<b>3   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PINEY WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON                3

    MUSIC CONTINUES. We float over RAILROAD TRACKS cutting
    through flat, piney woods, catching up the boys, who walk on
    the ties-


<b>5   EXT. ARMY BARRACKS - EARLY EVENING                             5
</b>    MUSIC CONTINUES. The boys stroll past white buildings of an

    grounds-


<b>6   EXT. RAILROAD BRIDGE, RIVER - EARLY EVENING                    6

<b>7   EXT. HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE - NIGHT                               7
</b>    We hear PIANO MUSIC as we CRANE DOWN toward the HONEYDRIPPER
    LOUNGE, a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads.
<b>                                                             3.
</b>


    BLUE-colored light bulbs (a few broken) FLICK ON and OFF
    erratically around the HONEYDRIPPER SIGN as we TRACK toward
    and then THROUGH it on the way to the entrance, catching up
    with Lonnie and Scratch.

    The boys step under the door-light, frantic with insects, and
    go up on their toes to peek in through a window-

<b>    SINGER
</b>
    A woman in her late 50's, early 60's, BERTHA MAE SPIVEY,
    leans into a MICROPHONE from where she sits on a stool on a
    little makeshift stage, a glass of whiskey in hand, and SINGS-

<b>                        BERTHA MAE
</b>              I know a gal name of Betty Sue
              Shook it so much
              She got the German flu
              No matter how she done it

              No matter how she done it
              She done it just the same

    As she sings we PAN and TRACK, moving through the large, near-
    empty COUNTRY ROADHOUSE-

<b>                        BERTHA MAE
</b>              You women don't worry
              About your life
              She made Jack the Ripper
              Throw away his knife-


    Only a few die-hard REGULARS are scattered at the tables and
    bar stools. A pretty young woman in her late teens, CHINA
    DOLL, is behind the bar, head held in her hands, listening
    aimlessly.

<b>                        BERTHA MAE
</b>              No matter how she done it

              No matter how she done it
              She done it just the same

    Lonnie and Scratch step in, cautiously looking around, hoping
    that nobody will notice and tell them to leave.
<b>                                                         4.

They plant themselves next to the piano, Lonnie intently
watching the long fingers work the keys- we TILT to see
TYRONE `Pinetop' Purvis, proprietor and piano player, in his
50's. He acts as if the boys aren't there, concentrating on
the music. We SHIFT to include Bertha Mae as she wraps up
the song-

<b>                    BERTHA MAE
</b>          A copper brought her in
          She didn't need no bail
          She shook it for the judge
          He threw the cop in jail
          No matter how she done it
          No matter how she done it
          No matter how she done it
          She done it just the same

SLICK, a pretty, sharply-dressed man in his late 40's at the
bar, and MACEO, who sits at a table near the bandstand
smiling throughout, APPLAUD. The sound makes the room seem
more empty.

Ty stands, nods to METALMOUTH SIMS, a slight, worried-looking
harmonica player who sits behind Bertha Mae-

<b>                    TY
</b>          You take it for a while.

As Ty crosses to the bar we hear RECORDED MUSIC booming from
outside-

<b>                    BERTHA MAE
</b>          They makin all that racket again at
          Toussaint's.

<b>                    TY

          there buying drinks and throwing
          their money after them dice and
          whatnot. Lucky we got none a that
          here.

Metalmouth launches into a HARMONICA INTRO. Ty pauses at the
counter next to Slick, who is attentively watching Bertha Mae-

<b>                    BERTHA MAE
</b>          You can drink your liquor
          You can drink your cold can beer-

<b>                    TY

Maceo arrives to join them, interrupting-

</b>          Lots of young folks. Come to

China Doll brings Ty a glass of whiskey.    He gives her a sad
smile-

<b>                    TY
</b>          Thanks, China Doll.

We FOLLOW as Ty crosses to the door-
<b>                                                           6.

Ty looks out the door at-


<b>POV - EXT. ACE OF SPADES CLUB

-the RED-lit ACE OF SPADES CLUB across the road, PEOPLE
hanging out in front, LAUGHTER heard from within-


<b>HONEYDRIPPER

Ty reacts.    Behind him, Maceo indicates the near-empty room-

<b>                       MACEO
</b>             Like the man say, you can't argue
             with failure.

STOKELY, a bitter drunk who holds on to the end of the bar,
calls out to them-

<b>                       STOKELY
</b>             You know why Slick here is like a
             preacher?

Slick tenses, used to this-

<b>                        STOKELY
</b>             Cause he does all his best work on
             his knees.

Stokely almost chokes with laughter-

             and use it to yank him around the
             house.

Slick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm-

They all turn to see DELILAH, Ty's wife, coming out from the
back of the club. She is dressed for church-

attention to China Doll-

Maceo gets behind the counter as Delilah heads for Ty at the
door-

just stepped in-

     Maceo rolls his eyes as he passes Ty on the way out with a
     FLASHLIGHT. He freezes in his tracks as the FLASHLIGHT BEAM
     hits a FIGURE standing in the doorway-

     It is SHERIFF HIRAM PUGH, large and in charge.    Pugh strolls
     into the club as if he owns it.

Ty has played this game before, trying to hold his ground
without pissing off the white man with the badge-

Ty doesn't respond. Sheriff Pugh stops right next to

won't meet his eyes-

It gets very quiet, the HISS of the KEROSENE LANTERN growing
tense and insistent.

China Doll looks from Sheriff Pugh to Ty's face, searching
for a flicker of evidence. Ty stays deadpan-

<b>                    TY
</b>          Just people talkin.

The Sheriff steps to put his face very close to Ty's, an edge
of menace in his voice when he speaks softly-

Ty holds Pugh's eyes for an agonizingly long moment, then the
sheriff turns and heads for the door-

</b>          You folks have a pleasant evening,

They turn to see Sonny standing in the doorway-

Ty's eyes fix on Sonny's face for a moment- something
familiar there- then go down to the guitar case at his feet-

character, leading the prosperous looking MR. SIMMONS into
the club as if they aren't there-

Ty stands-

A frozen moment.    Then Maceo stands as well, backing up his
friend.

Cool Breeze puts one foot up on the chair next to Ty, licks a
finger and dabs at his shoeshine with it-

He nods toward Mr. Simmons-

Cool Breeze takes his foot down and gets up in Ty's face. He
lets his jacket fall open so the butt of his .44 PISTOL is
visible-

Simmons-

Ty and Maceo wait till the men are gone before they speak-

An awkward pause.   Both men are shaken.   Ty sits back down to
think-

<b>                    MACEO
</b>          They say first thing he does is go
          to the man that owns the joint,

     The loader lets down the tailgate to reveal CASES OF BEER AND

     ground-

desperate, waving the poster-

on the other side of him-

Ty, watching forlornly-

direction-

The new truck slows to a stop by them.    The DRIVER pokes his
head out-

Honeydripper-

<b>                    MACEO
</b>          Got so bad, I heard there was some
          ole boy goes around pretendin to be
          Guitar Sam, fill out the gigs he
          misses. Does pretty well for
          hisself, what I hear-

Ty pauses on the keyboard-

          a story I heard.

They both go back to brooding.   Ty takes a drink.   He stares
at the keyboard-

<b>                    TY
</b>          There must have been a first one.

<b>                    MACEO
</b>          First what?

<b>                    TY
</b>          Back slavery days, they had the
          ones that worked in the big house.
          Might not of had shoes always, but
          their pants didn't have no holes
          and they didn't pick no cotton.

<b>                    MACEO
</b>          House niggers.

<b>                    TY
</b>          That's how they called em. They
          must of had all their African kinda
          instruments- drums, shakers, some
          kind of banjo thing- but the piano-

<b>                    MACEO
</b>          Didn't bring no piano over on them
          ships from Africa.
<b>                                                74.

<b>                    TY
</b>          The piano was just sittin there in
          the white folks' big room, all
          polished up-- and I figure this
          one boy, he goes past fifteen,
          twenty times a day, running the
          corner of his eye over it. And
          he's there when they play, the
          masters, doin all their minuets and
          whatever-

Ty PLAYS something like a MINUET-

<b>                    TY
</b>          -him standing there with a tray of
          white people food pretendin not to
          have a thought in his head, might
          be only some dust hangin in the air
          for all they know- but he's
          watchin the fingers, see, watchin
          them keys work. This old boy, the
          first one, he can play alla them
          Africa kinda instruments, he can
          play mud if you give him the key
          and the tempo, he's got music in
          his head, in his heart, in every
          damn piece of him there's music.

<b>                    MACEO
</b>          Down to the bones--

<b>                    TY
</b>          And one day the masters is away,
          huntin foxes or some rich white
          people thing they get up to, and
          he's alone in the room with that
          piano and he comes over and sits
          down on the bench-

<b>                    MACEO
</b>          Watch out now-

<b>                    TY
</b>          -and he spreads his fingers out the
          way he seen the minuet player do-
          and he-

Ty hits a MINOR CHORD, lets it decay-

<b>                    TY
</b>          And he thinks- `Lord help me, I
          could do some damage with this.'

A silence.    Maceo is moved by the scene-

<b>                       MACEO
</b>             Would have liked to been there. I
             mean to hear the cat play, not none
             of the rest of it.

Ty gets up and crosses the room with his drink in his hand,
distraught. This is the end for Ty, no strategies left,
nothing but the bitter taste of total defeat-

<b>                       TY

WHAP! He kicks Sonny's guitar case, left sticking out under
a table, and sends it spinning across the floor till it
CRASHES into the bar and flips open. Ty and Maceo stare at
the contents-

<b>                       TY
</b>             What the hell that sposed to be?

Maceo pulls out a home-built SOLID BODY GUITAR, a painted
white rectangle with a complicated PICKUP jury-rigged over
the strings and yards of ELECTRICAL CORD hanging off it-

around the wires coming out of the wall. He nods to Ty-

Sonny starts to hook his guitar up with a thick COIL OF WIRE,
then into the dented AMP sitting on a wooden chair beside him
and pointed out at the crowd. Metalmouth Sims looks on
uncomfortably. Ty puts on his biggest grin, easing behind
the keyboard-

fedora-

A TERRIBLE SQUAWK emits from the amp as Sonny makes the
connection-

Sheriff Pugh cover his ears-

The girls from the store cover their ears, making pained
faces-

Sonny pulls his guitar away from the amp and the SQUAWK
settles to a FUZZY BUZZ. Sonny frowns at the amp-

</b>          Sorry, folks- must of got kicked on
          the train.

The audience is stone-faced.   Could this really be the man?

Young Henry steps up and sits behind the DRUM KIT, pulling
sticks from inside his shirt-

Ty closes his eyes, begins to shake his head in defeat-

China Doll looks worried, collecting another cover charge at
the door-

Delilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage,
worried-

Sonny holds his arms out wide, shifting his body to get the
BUZZ under control-

Dex leans to talk in Junebug's ear-

Maceo isn't going to wait to find out. He grabs the wires
with both hands, yanks- they hold firm! He looks to the
stage, panicked-

-as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp
BLASTS the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering,
<b>ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO!

Ty stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open-

Sonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone-

Sonny looks over to Ty, who catches himself and begins to
play along. Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast
shuffle on the skins-

Ty looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to
pull the wires out. Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off-

look upward-

Time Trenier has his case open now, the gleaming instrument
in one hand, squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to
the light with the other-

The crowd is already CLAPPING and STOMPING in time with the
song. Henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to
keep time-

     Time Trenier screws the mouthpiece on, puts his horn to his
     lips and BLOWS right on the beat to take the sax break,
     walking through the parting crowd to the bandstand!

     Junebug grabs Opal's hand and they begin to DANCE a modified
     jitterbug, people spreading to give them room-

     Sheriff Pugh, hands still over his ears, sits in a corner
     paying special attention to Opal's hip action-

     As Time continues to blow, stepping up onto the stage, Sonny
     keeps urging Metalmouth Sims to come closer to his microphone
     with the harmonica. Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving-
     closer, closer-

     Metalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty, who nods from the
     piano, so he butts his harp smack against the microphone,
     takes a deep breath and HONKS his soul out, grabbing the
     break from Time!

     The audience goes wild, a half-dozen couples dancing now,
     others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat
     where they stand. Sonny shakes out the long CORD attached to
     his guitar-

     China Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new
     CUSTOMERS pressing in the door and dance at the same time,
     thrilled by the music. Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind
     her as she turns toward the bandstand-

     Metalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the
     guitar again, making it WAIL as he hops off the stage, steps
     up on a chair, then onto the bar counter!

     He walks the length of the bar, playing his ass off, hops
     down at the far end, grins at China Doll and heads out
     through the door, dragging extension cord behind! Lonnie and
     Scratch hurry to pull slack for him as he steps out into the

     out of Toussaint's that he wants them to follow, then hops

A slow, sexy SAX BREAK comes up and Ty leaves the piano to
cross to the bar. When he gets there Maceo is already
counting out a huge pile of BILLS-
<b>                                                          109.
</b>


<b>                    MACEO
</b>          Hundred forty-two, forty-three,
          forty-four, five, six, seven,
          eight, nine- hundred fifty. And
          they's another fifty in here-

Maceo thunks a heavy CLOTH SACK full of change onto the
countertop-

<b>                    MACEO
</b>          Lucky Hardaway don't mind some
          change, does he?

Cool Breeze doesn't even glance at the money, hard-eying Ty
instead-

<b>                    COOL BREEZE
</b>          What if Mr. Hardaway was to say let
          the chumps keep their change, he
          wants the club back one way or the
          other?

Maceo looks to Ty, who remains impassive, mind working-

<b>                    COOL BREEZE
</b>          How'd that be?

<b>                    TY
</b>          Well- he'd have to take it up with
          my bidness partner.

Ty shifts and we RACK FOCUS to see across the room to Sheriff
Pugh, receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from
Delilah. Ty smiles and waves-

Cool Breeze reconsiders his terms-

<b>                    COOL BREEZE
</b>          That sheriff your partner?

<b>                    TY
</b>          (sighs) Yeah, and he's twice as
          mean as he is ugly.

Cool Breeze grins, scoops up the bills on the counter-

<b>                    COOL BREEZE
</b>          You must want this club awful bad,
          brother.

Cool Breeze hefts the sack of change, shoots a look to the
stage and leans over to speak into Ty's ear-
<b>                                                        110.
</b>


<b>                    COOL BREEZE
</b>          You maybe know this already, but
          that aint no Guitar Sam.

He steps away just as the song ends to APPLAUSE, Ty taking a
deep sigh of relief. Sonny steps up to the microphone to
introduce the next song-

<b>                    TOUSSAINT (O.S.)
</b>          You is a lie!

A shocked silence.

The audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come
tottering up to the foot of the stage. He points a bony
finger at Sonny-

<b>                    TOUSSAINT
</b>          You is a lie, boy! I known Sammy
          since he's drinkin mama's milk,
          hell, I known his Mama herself when
          she live up to Plaquemine- and you
          aint him!

The audience looks to Sonny for his defense-

Ty holds his breath.   Maceo brings the baseball bat up from
behind the bar.

Sonny just smiles-

<b>                    SONNY
</b>          That's Creole Guitar Sam you talkin
          bout, Pops. I'm Delta Guitar Sam.

Toussaint ponders this a moment, then huffs-

<b>                    TOUSSAINT
</b>          As long as we straight on that.

<b>                    JUNEBUG
</b>          Get on outa there and let the man
          play!

A CHORUS of CRIES to the same effect, and Sonny crosses back
to his microphone-

<b>                    SONNY
</b>          Imonna play you one I come up with
          today while I was havin my hair cut-

He starts into a bouncy INTRO that Metalmouth joins in with,
then starts to SING as the crowd starts to dance and clap-
<b>                                                       111.

<b>                    SONNY

          I can't get you offa my mind!
          If you be my baby
          Gonna leave all them others behind!

The front row is all girls goggling at Sonny, instant
groupies- but we RACK to China Doll, transfixed, as she is
drawn toward the stage-

<b>                    SONNY
</b>          Oh China Doll
          Think about you day and night!
          Oh China Doll
          I think about you day and night!
          Can't forget you baby
          Oh when you gonna treat me right?

Time Trenier steps in for a growling SAX BREAK-


<b>TY
</b>
Ty looks around the crowded, rocking room-


<b>POV - SHERIFF PUGH
</b>
The Sheriff makes his way through the crowd and out the door.
The last person he passes turns toward Ty-

Possum?

But then DANCERS cross in front and he is gone.


<b>TY
</b>
Ty frowns, troubled. Under the sax now we hear a dissonant
SLIDE GUITAR, the haunting notes Possum was playing at the
train station. Ty searches the crowd-


<b>POV
</b>
The SLIDE GUITAR continues underneath as we PAN across the
crowd dancing-

There's Possum again, at the bar, face turned toward Ty.
<b>                                                              112.
</b>



<b>     TY
</b>
     We TIGHTEN on TY.   Why is he here?


<b>     POV - POSSUM
</b>
     Possum turns his head slowly, fixes on something, and we PAN
     to see Dex and Ham standing toe-to-toe, snarling into each
     other's face.

     We PUNCH IN tighter and tighter on the young men, body
     language telling us a fight is about to break out-


<b>     ECU TY
</b>
     Ty desperately pushes his way across the crowded floor to
     reach them and the FLASHBACKS come again, the SAX MUSIC
     growing echoey and menacing-


<b>     INT. BAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

</b>     The shaky perspective and over-saturated colors again, tight
     on the men struggling, the Girl cowering, then Young Tyrone
     twisting the Guitar Man's wrist and thrusting, again and
     again, hugging close to him, then pulled away and the-

     -KNIFE falls to the floor, BLOODY, and the-

     -Guitar Man falls to his hands and knees, his stomach a
     bloody mess, crawling on all fours and HOWLING and Young
     Tyrone watching in horror as he is held back by many arms and
     the Girl SCREAMING-

</b>     -which becomes Time BLOWING HIS SAX into the microphone-

     -and Dex reaches for his pistol-

     -and Ham reaches for his knife, but-

     -a huge, strong hand clamps down on Dex's wrist-

     -and another huge hand grabs Ham's wrist!

     Ty is there, clamping onto them with a grip of iron.
<b>                                                        113.
</b>


A lighter, bouncier ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF has replaced the sax
now. Ty looks deep into the eyes of the two surprised
pickers-

<b>                    TY
</b>          Yall in my house, here, gentlemen.
          Don't have no fightin, don't have
          no killin, don't have none of that
          dismal nonsense in my house.
          Understand? What's your name son?

Dex is shaken by the strength of the grip on his arm-

<b>                    DEX
</b>          Dex- Dexter Moncrief.

<b>                       TY
</b>          And you?

<b>                    HAM
</b>          Hamilton Drinkwater.

<b>                    TY
</b>          Well, gentlemen, this is the night
          there won't be no pitiful song
          written bout you two killin each
          other. Don't nothin rhyme with
          `Moncrief' anyhow.

Maceo is there now, holding a cardboard BOX in one hand and
the BASEBALL BAT in the other-

<b>                    MACEO
</b>          Got a problem here?

<b>                    TY
</b>          These young men seem to brought
          something in for our collection.

<b>                     MACEO
</b>          (to Dex)   Yours first.

Ty gently takes the pistol from Dex, regards it grimly before
laying it in the box. He turns his attention to Ham-

<b>                       TY
</b>          Now yours.

He takes the knife from Ham, tosses it in the box-

<b>                    TY
</b>          Yall still need to mess with each
          other, you go outside and do it.

</b>


     Ty lets go of their wrists-

<b>                         TY
</b>               This world is full of people got no
               use for us, like to see us in the
               grave. We don't need to give em
               any help.

     The two give each other a final dirty look and move away into
     opposite corners-


<b>     STAGE
</b>
     Sonny keeps playing-

<b>                         SONNY

               I loved you from the very start!

     Ty rushes to the piano, joins in jamming with the other
     players-


<b>76   EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT                                         76
</b>     Slick sits on a tomb, drinking wine, MOONLIGHT spilling over
     Bertha Mae's fresh-dug GRAVE. He listens to the MUSIC in the
     far distance-

<b>                         SLICK

</b>     The SUN RISES next to the Honeydripper sign. We hear the
     CROW of a distant ROOSTER. The parking lot is empty but for
     Ty's old Ford-

     Ty, exhausted but happy, steps out front. He pastes a SNIPE
     that says HELD OVER! across the Guitar Sam poster-

<b>                         POSSUM (O.S.)
</b>               That boy can play some.

     Ty turns. Possum is on the road, guitar strung over his
     shoulder, feeling his way with a red-tipped CANE.

<b>                         TY

     Ty watches the blind man move away for a moment.

<b>78   EXT. SHARECROPPER SHACK - EARLY MORNING                      78
</b>     Scratch and Lonnie are set to pretend to play music again.
     Lonnie spreads his fingers over the keys he's drawn on the
     board-

     -and begins to PLAY!    Fast, rhythmic boogie piano-
<b>                                                       116.

  Instead of a Diddley bow, Scratch is pretending to tune the
  two strings on a `guitar' made of a plank of wood and baling
  wire. He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope
  leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of
  the shack, plugging himself in. He looks to Lonnie, who
  nods, and then-

  -he begins to PLAY in time with Lonnie.

  We CRANE UP and away from them, the MUSIC spilling out over
  the field-

  It sounds a whole lot like rock and roll.
