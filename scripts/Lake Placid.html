     OVER BLACK we HEAR the distant but near melodic CRY of a LOON.

<b>     SLOWLY FADE IN TO:
</b>

<b>     EXT. BLACK LAKE - NIGHT
</b>
     The loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts
     off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.  The loon
     continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake,
     the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely
     call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under,
     silenced forever.  A lone feather surfaces and floats as:

     Credits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing "I CAN
     SEE CLEARLY NOW." Then--

<b>     OVER BLACK
</b>
<b>                         KEOUGH (O.S.)
</b>               And they pay you for this?  To tag
               beaver?

<b>                         WALT (O.S.)
</b>               Imagine.

     As we FADE IN a face COMES INTO FOCUS from underwater.  It is
     the face of WALT LAWSON (Maine Fish And Game) looking down from
     a boat.


<b>     EXT. LAKE - DAY
</b>
     Next to him is SHERIFF HANK KEOUGH, paunch, disposition of an
     untipped waiter.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Ask me, what an animal does in the
               wild is his own business so long as
               he doesn't do it to man.  I think
               Mark Twain said that.

<b>                         WALT
</b>                    (dry)
               I think he didn't.  But since
               you've said it, I guess we're
               covered.

     Keough holds a stare.  Walt drops overboard.  Keough pulls a
     Twinkie from his pocket.  Begins to unwrap.


<b>     EXT. NEW YORK - MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

</b>
     FIND  KELLY SCOTT, pretty, thirty, as KEVIN CAMPBELL, forties,
     approaches.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Kelly.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (warmly)
               Kevin, hey.

     She beams affection, he exudes a little discomfort.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a
               second?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (great idea)
               Absolutely.


<b>     INT. KEVIN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     They enter ON THE CUT, he closes the door.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I had a great time last night.
               Again.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Me too.

     Reading his look, she suddenly smells it.  Her face drops.

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                    (deducing)
               That's not what you came to say.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               You work for me.  I'm not
               comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

     She's a little crushed.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I was working for you when "us"
               started, what's--

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I know and I thought I could handle
               it but work and pleasure along with
               somebody else, it's a dangerous
               mix.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Kevin, as long as we...
                    (suddenly)
               What was that last part?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>                    (sheepish)
               The somebody else part?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Yeah, that part.  There's...
               somebody who's um...

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>                    (feels terrible)
               Else.

     A beat.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (covering)
               Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This
               uh... this probably wasn't meant to
               be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I
               gotta be ten years younger and you,
               you... you're y'know...

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>                    (reading her mind)
               A jerk.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (you have no idea)
               Oh...
                    (then)
               No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm
               just thrown, I'm...
                    (checks her watch)
               I actually have an early lunch,
               so...

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               It's ten after nine.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Yes, well...
                    (smiling)
               famished.

     And she rushes out of the room.  OFF Kevin, we:

</b>
<b>     EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
     Walt dives down, visibility is lousy. Whether it's algae or
     dense vegetation, the water is extremely murky.


<b>     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Keough unwraps the second Twinkie.


<b>     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Walt continues to swim.

<b>     HIS P.O.V.
</b>
     Not much to look at.  Then suddenly... no, just a snapping
     turtle swimming away.  Walt descends a little deeper.  He loves
     it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere
     else.  Next best thing to meditation.  Suddenly, he stops
     kicking.

<b>     HIS EYES FOCUS
</b>
     A black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length.

<b>     RESUME
</b>
     Walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look.  The snake
     seems unimpressed.  Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him,
     misses.  Shit.  Walt's look says "what the fuck?"  A beat.  Then
     the snake swims off.  Walt relaxes.  A beat.  But then... he
     looks around, uneasy.  He gets this feeling he's not alone down
     there.  Looks about, nothing but murky water.  But he's not
     alone, we can feel he's not alone.

     He looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering,
     looking back at him.  What's with these snakes?  Walt decides
     he'll go back to the boat.  Then... BOOM.  Something hits him...
     and it's no snake.


<b>     EXT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Keough.  Oblivious.  Waiting.  Suddenly-- Walt comes thrusting
     up with a scream!

<b>                         WALT
</b>               Sheriff!!

     And Walt is promptly yanked back under.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Hey!

     Upon which Walt surfaces.  He swims frantically for a beat
     before he's suddenly yanked under again.  Then he surfaces,
     thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat.  He takes hold of
     him and pulls him on board.  Actually... what's left of him.
     There's nothing below the waist.  Walt is just a bleeding torso,
     though still conscious.

               Jesus Christ.

<b>     ANGLE WALT'S REMAINING HAND
</b>
     clenching around Keough's arm.

<b>     ANGLE WALT'S FACE
</b>
     He knows he's done.  OFF Keough's continued horror, we:

<b>                                             CUT TO:
</b>
<b>     BLACK AND WHITE

     A DINOSAUR (T-Rex) is angry and out for blood.

<b>     REVEAL
</b>

<b>     INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
</b>
     We're watching an old classic creature feature.  FIND Kelly
     alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense... watching the movie.
     As the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the
     popcorn bag and her mouth.

<b>     ANGLE THE SCREEN
</b>
     The monster pursues its human victim.

<b>     ANGLE KELLY
</b>
     fear on her face.

<b>     ANGLE THE SCREEN
</b>
     The monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey.

<b>     ANGLE KELLY
</b>
     as she screams with fear and delight.  Her scream is only
     partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers.

     After a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again.  Wearing
     gullibility, vulnerability all over her face.  Then from behind
     a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with
     the most blood-curdling scream of all.

     All the moviegoers turn to SEE... as will WE:

<b>     MYRA OKUBO
</b>
     Thirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder.

<b>     EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY
</b>
     Kelly and Okubo emerge from the movie theater.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               What do you expect, mugging me from
               behind?

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>               I tapped you.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Well you shouldn't have.  How did
               you even know where I was.

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>                    (sarcastic)
               Wild guess.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I don't like to be scared, Myra, I
               have a thing about fright, don't
               ever scare me.

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>               Kevin told me you were upset.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Really?  I never realized he was so
               psychic, how could he detect that,
               did he tell you there's somebody
               else?

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>                    (sheepish)
               Well... he didn't have to tell me
               that part.

     Kelly freezes.  Stares at her.  Then:

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               You?

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>               It started before you, Kelly, I
               never would've--

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               You?

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>               It was just a quick thing which we
               thought was over, and and...

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               You and Kevin.

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>               It wasn't suppose to happen, I
               don't know what to say...

     A beat.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               You don't know what to say, lucky
               for you action speaks louder than
               words.

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>               Kelly--

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just
               never thought of you as a y'know...

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>               Backstabber?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (don't be silly)
               No.

<b>                         OKUBO
</b>               Liar?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (c'mon)
               Myra.

<b>                         OKUBO

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I really... I should get back.

     And Kelly peels off to go on her way.  Bumps into a Pedestrian.
     She then gives him an angry shove, under--

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                    (to the pedestrian)
               Don't fuck with me!

     And off she goes.  The Pedestrian and Okubo exchange a look.

     Coroner's ambulance.  Walt's covered body is being loaded, as
     JACK WELLS, Fish and Game, thirty, emerges from his truck.  He
     approaches the body.  Lifts up the sheet.  Stares a beat in
     disbelief.  Turns to Keough.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               What did this?

     Kelly's in her office, working at her desk.  Kevin enters.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Hey.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Kevin.  How's it going, what's
               happenin', family good, great, nice
               to catch up, get out.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               This is business.
                    (then)
               There was an accident in Maine,
               some guy got killed by something in
               a lake.  Probably a bear, but...
               they found a tooth.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               A tooth?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               A tooth they say couldn't have come
               from any bear.  They say it looks
               prehistoric.  Like maybe a
               dinosaur.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (without looking up)
               Oh, well then I'm sure that's it,
               he got killed by a dinosaur,
               anything else?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I want you to go there.

     Now she looks up.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Sorry?

<b>                         KEVIN

               do, I--

<b>                         KELLY

<b>                         KEVIN

</b>               Well on this one I'd like you to
               be.

     Kelly stares back.  The nickle drops.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               This was Myra's idea, wasn't it?
               Get me out of the office for a few
               days, until--

<b>                         KEVIN

</b>               I never do field work and even if
               I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of
               a dinosaur who bit somebody,
               couldn't you dream up something--

     Kelly is walking with Keough toward the morgue.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               He just came up screaming.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Did he say anything?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               He just kinda gurgled.  He was
               pretty much dead.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               And you didn't see anything?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               The lake was dead calm until up he
               came.  The tooth is in there.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (seeing)
               There?  That's the morgue.

<b>                         KEOUGH

<b>                         KELLY

     The Medical Examiner, STEVEN DANIELS, is there with Keough and
     kelly.  Walt's torso is covered.  Kelly is examining the tooth.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I need to get a microscopic look at

</b>               I'm fine, thank you.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Have you ever seen a dead body
               before, Ms. Scott?

</b>               Well.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I can look at dead things.

     And Daniels is about to pull the sheet back--

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)

     She takes a breath.

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>               Okay.

     And Daniels peels back the sheet.  Kelly strains to disguise her
     extreme horror.  Finally--

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               And this is how he came to the
               boat?

<b>     EXT. INDIGO MAINE - DAY
</b>
     It's a small, almost tiny town; general store, post office, fire
     station.  Kelly and Keough are in front of the general store
     loading supplies into a van, across the street in front of the
     Sheriff's Department.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Nobody lives within twenty-five
               miles, 'cept some old couple who
               live right on the lake.  Teenagers
               trek in every once in a while, none
               have disappeared, and none have
               spotted anything unusual.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               You talk to the married couple?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Not yet.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               What kind of backup do we have?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               We?

     That strikes a nerve.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (defensive)
               What?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear
               as to why the Museum of Natural
               History would send somebody here.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               You have a thing against museums?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               I got nothing against--

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Ever even been in one?

     He stares back.  Then picks up a huge cannon-like gun.  As he
     loads it--

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               What is that?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Lightweight Forward Area air device
               unit.  Whatever's out there, one
               shot with this and he's dead.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (incredulous)
               And you stock these things for
               what, to fend off Russia?

     A beat.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               You're sort of a rude person.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               It's just that--

     Suddenly, like a shot, Kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a
     white fog from a can of Yard Guard.  Keough holds a look at her.

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>               Mosquitos.  I have a thing about
               mosquitos.

     Upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked "Maine
     Fish And Game".  Jack Wells emerges, Kelly's eyes scan him like
     radar.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               We set?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Ready.
                    (re Kelly; dry)
               A museum in New York sent us some
               additional back up.

     Kelly shoots Keough a look.  Then:

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Kelly Scott.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Are we all museum bigots in Maine?

     Jack holds a look, decides to let that pass.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Did you make anything of the tooth?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Yes, it did seem prehistoric but
               I'm sure he just carried the thing
               for luck.  Not that it worked,
               obviously.  It probably somehow got
               lodged into his body.

     Jack holds another look.

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>               Why are you staring at me?
                    (to Keough)
               Do I have a smudge on my face, it
               would be so you not to have told
               me.

     Keough also lets that pass.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (to Jack)
               I'm ready when you are.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Let's go.

     As they start out, Kelly grabs Jack by the arm.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Excuse me.  One other thing, it's
               a small point, but... I have a
               thing about being humored, and I'm
               feeling humored, more by him, but
               you seemed quick to join in.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Ma'am, your first impression isn't
               going well.

     As JANINE POST, sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up.

<b>                         JANINE
</b>               Excuse me?  Is it true you're going
               to look for some kind of monster in
               Black Lake?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               We're just going to investigate an
               accident.  There's no monster.

<b>                         JANINE
</b>               We heard a man got bit in half.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               There was an accident, that's all.
               Nothing to worry about.

     And Janine goes into the store.  The men just watch her go.
     Sixteen going on twenty, nubile.  Kelly just looks at the men,
     gaping at the girl.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Please.

     Keough, Jack, and Kelly are in a boat motoring towards a

<b>     INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Jack, Kelly and Keough are questioning DELORES BICKERMAN, mid-
     sixties, eccentric if not slightly daffy.  She's brought out
     refreshments.

<b>                         BICKERMAN
</b>               Oh, my husband passed away almost
               two years ago.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               My department doesn't have any
               record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.

<b>                         BICKERMAN
</b>                    (with some attitude)
               Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't
               realize you keep such a firm track
               of the dead.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (gently)
               What was the cause of your
               husband's death, Ma'am, do you
               know?

     Off Bickerman's silence--

</b>               Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're
               up here... a man was fatally
               attacked yesterday by some animal
               in this lake.  Do you know how your

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         KEOUGH

                     simply)
               Well, he was very ill and he
               refused to go see a doctor and
               well... I think he had Alzheimer's,
               he would be coherent one day,
               incoherent the next and one
               coherent day, he asked me to end
               his suffering.  I wouldn't do it
               but he kept insisting and insisting
               and deteriorating till the point
               the only cognitive thing he could
               really do was that I finish him
               off.  Finally I just gave in and
               hit him on the head with a skillet
               then buried him under the bulkhead.

     He leans over to grab something floating in the water.  Looks
     like a branch.  He lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler.
     Connected to the severed head of a moose.  Keough, seeing it as
     he lifts it, screams, throwing it.

     It hits Kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the
     HEAD hits the floor of the boat with a HEAVY THUD.  Kelly rears
     back, still screaming, and belts Keough in the shoulder.

<b>                         KEOUGH

       Did you see that?

     She belts him again.

<b>                KEOUGH                      JACK (CONT'D)

<b>     EXT. BEACHSIDE CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER

     A small tent camp is being set up.  People unpacking.  Two
     Deputies, BURKE and STEPHENS, present.  Kelly is with Jack.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               How big do the bears get?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Big but... a bear couldn't do that
               to a moose or man in water.  On

<b>                         KELLY

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Hank says he's sure.

               I also was dating my boss he turned
               out to be involved with a co-worker
               who was also my friend and for the
               sake of comfort, theirs, I was

     There.  She said it.  He stares back.

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)

                    (extending his hand to

               Hector.  The big one has no sense
               of humor.  And since he's the one
               who decides whether you get to
               play, try not to be your obnoxious

<b>     EXT. LAKE - SUNSET
</b>
     Keough and Kelly are in one canoe, Hector and Jack are alongside
     in another.  Hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar
     devices.  The calm.  The still.  The beauty.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               If he's here, I'll find him.

               Did she tell you we had sex
               together?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I never had sex with you!

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Even so, you're allowed to boast.
               You look thin by the way, I've
               mentally undressed you, I can see
               your ribcage.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               I really don't mean to be
               discourteous.
                    (patronizing)
               But how is it a person could come
               to believe that a crocodile is in
               New England?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               They have saltwater glands, they
               can swim across oceans, it's only
               a matter of time.

<b>                         KEOUGH

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               They can survive winter.  As long
               as their nostrils don't freeze,
               they survive,
                    (to Kelly)

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (knows his crocodiles)
               If he's eaten in the area, he
               shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang
               around the food source.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               But they're nighttime hunters,
               Hector, he'd probably be on land
               now anyway.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               'Cept he wasn't before, was he?
                    (then to Keough)
               You know, when friends or family
               members say things, they tend not
               to register so sometimes it helps
               to hear it from a total stranger.
               You're fat.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Hector.

     Suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty
     feet away.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               What's that?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               White perch.

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Doesn't look like it.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               They look like they're jumping.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               They look scared.

     Upon which something grabs the front of Kelly's canoe and with
     one crisp yank, flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table,
     sending them all flying.

     In an instant, Keough and Kelly are swimming for their lives.
     Screaming/yelling, they scramble for the canoe, climb onto it's
     flipped-over back.  Breathless, they all exchange confused
     looks.  "What the hell happened"?

</b>               Well until we see it, we're not

     As DEPUTY SHARON GARE approaches--

               You might want to see this.

     They all walk over.

<b>     ANGLE THE GROUND

     There's hundreds, maybe a thousand worms squirming,
     surrounding... a human toe.

<b>                         KELLY (O.S.)
</b>               Oh God, worms.  I got a thing about

</b>               It's a human toe.

     Hector studies it, picks it up.  Then--

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Some decomposition, little acidic,
               it has been swallowed.
                    (to Keough; holding the
                     toe)
               Is this the man who was killed?

     Keough deadpans back.  Then--

</b>               We'd only just met.

     Kelly is testing a MACHINE that sends out little SQUEAKY SOUNDS,
     as Jack approaches.  He stops.  Takes a second to... well,
     admire her.  She's an attractive woman.  He then approaches.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Baby crocs?

<b>                         KELLY

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Because they just consult their

</b>               Listen... if you really do know
               crocs, you should know how stealth
               like they are.  I wouldn't be
               standing a foot from the water.

     She looks.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)

               I'd be able to see something.

     Upon which, Jack tosses a rock over her shoulder.  As it makes
     a splash, she screams and practically jumps into his arms.
     Then:

     Two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of
     his tent.  From within we HEAR MUSIC, the SOUNDS of a PARTY.
     Keough approaches... looks at Deputy Burke, who's digging.

<b>                         BURKE
</b>                    (shrugs)
               He paid us.  Five hundred.

     Keough continues on toward the tent.


<b>     INT. HECTOR'S TENT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     His tent is on the palatial side.  Stereo, generator, he's got a
     margarita bar going.  There's a party.  Hector's dancing with
     Deputy Gare, others are enjoying the drinks and MUSIC.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               You're a beautiful woman.

<b>                         GARE

</b>               And law enforcement, such dangerous
               work.  The idea that you could die
               suddenly with no offspring,
               disconcerting, let's mate, commit
               your genes to perpetuity.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Hey.

     He goes, turns OFF the MUSIC.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               We are here on official business.

<b>                         HECTOR

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               They come on land and they're
               brazen.  They're also attracted to
               noise, you can see I make a lot of
               it.

</b>               Everybody out, back to your tents,

     And they all go, including Gare, who shrugs to Keough "he's kind
     of funny".

<b>                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
</b>                    (to Hector)

               I'm letting you be part of this is
               'cause you got the helicopter and
               the radar--

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               And you like me.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               I do not like you.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing
               fond of you and it's liberating to
               say so.

     Keough stares back.

<b>                         KEOUGH

     There's a little chemistry here, though both would probably deny
     it.  He heads off toward his tent, she sits with her book.  She
     gives one last look, watches him go.  Then she goes back to her
     book.

     The lake is still, the campfire is out, the tents are quiet.
     The quiet SOUNDS of NIGHT.  CRICKETS.  A LOON.  An OWL.  A
     courageous raccoon looks about, seeing what he can rummage.  By
     the water... a black bear takes a drink.

<b>     ANGLE KEOUGH'S TENT
</b>
     He emerges, compelled by a full bladder, wearing only his
     trousers, carrying a revolver.  He walks into the nearby woods.
     He removes from his shorts his bladder's connection to the
     outside world.  Proceeds to URINATE.  Then... he hears
     something.  The SOUND of RUSTLING LEAVES.  He STOPS URINATING,
     we HEAR a HALF SECOND of MOVEMENT.  Then quiet.  Must be his
     imagination.  He RESUMES his business.

     More RUSTLING, it's not just the sound of dense urine against
     leaves, he stops... something's out there in the darkness.
     Quiet.  He starts up for a second, STOPS QUICKLY, and we HEAR it
     for sure.  Something's RUSTLING TOWARDS him.  With his free
     hand, Keough pulls out his revolver.  More RUSTLING... Keough
     points the gun.  Something on the ground is coming toward him.
     He moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness.  The RUSTLING is
     getting LOUDER.  It's almost upon him.  A beat.  CLOSER.
     CLOSER.  Then Keough peels away a bush revealing:

     Looking into a gun barrel.  He screams.  Keough screams.  Then--

     The steam is lifting off the lake.


<b>     EXT. LAKE - MORNING
</b>
     Keough, Kelly, Hector, and Deputy Burke are cruising in the
     whaler.  Hector and Jack are both in full diving gear.  Jack
     also has a stick gun for protection.  Hector does not.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Again, I don't mean to be annoying
               with my questions.  But if it is a
               crocodile which I don't think it
               is.  And if they do charge these
               baby hatchling sounds...
                    (to Jack)
               why exactly would you want to be
               underwater at the time?
                    (to Hector)
               With you it makes sense.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               They don't really attack underwater
               and--

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               No crocodile has ever--

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (to Hector)
               You should take a flax pole.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He
               drowns.  You think about that?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I'm just saying last resort.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do
               we have a problem with it dying?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Crocodiles don't sever with their
               teeth, their molars are blunt.

     As if that's suppose to clear it up.  Keough stares back
     blankly.  Then:

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Is this a trick?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               What I'm saying is if it's a
               crocodile that cut a man in half he
               would have to be over twenty feet
               which would make him well over a
               hundred years old, it would be
               unthinkable to destroy him.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to Burke)
               Alright, let's just drop here.

     Burke lowers the anchor, as Keough just continues to stare at
     Hector.  Kelly readies the hatchling recorder.  She lowers it
     into the water.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               They respond pretty quick.  I'll
               wait till you get down before I
               turn it on.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Good.
                    (climbing over)
               See ya soon.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Good luck.

     There was a twinge of real concern in her voice.  He makes eye
     contact with her.  Then drops over.  Goes under.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (to Kelly)
               Two years married, divorced, used
               to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still
               waiting on his sperm count.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               What?
                    (off Hector's look)
               Oh as if I'm interested.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               As if.
                    (as he's about to go
                     overboard; to Keough)
               Will you miss me?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (to Hector)
               I brought a pork chop, maybe we
               could hang it around your neck for
               luck.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               No thank you, but maybe later you
               can chew the bark off my big fat
               log.

     And Hector drops overboard.

<b>                         KEOUGH

     The boats sit still on the dead calm water.  Kelly works the

     They both scan the surface.  Dead calm.

     Hector moves about.  We can hear the HATCHLING RECORDER, but
     he's not seeing anything.


<b>     EXT. UNDERWATER - (ANOTHER AREA) - CONTINUOUS

     Jack looks about.  He looks up.  Doesn't see much but he gets an
     eerie feeling.  Something's out there.

     Keough, Kelly, and Burke, standing idly, scanning the calm
     surface.

     little.

               Something tugged us.

     Upon which something really yanks the boat.  So hard... Kelly
     flips over the back, into the water.

<b>                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
</b>               Hey!

     The boat is moving, being dragged quickly.

<b>                         KEOUGH

               Cut the line!  Cut the fucking
               line!

     Burke goes to work on the anchor line as we ANGLE Kelly,
     treading water, in the middle of nowhere.  She's completely
     vulnerable.


<b>     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Hector, swimming for the surface.


<b>     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Kelly, treading water.  FIND Keough on the boat, he now has the
     engine running, fighting against the drag but whatever has that
     boat has a fucking strong hold.

<b>                         KEOUGH

</b>                    (working away)
               I'm trying!

     And finally, as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne
     with a jump, Burke nearly sails out.  Keough's boat then races
     to Kelly.

<b>     ANGLE KELLY
</b>
<b>                         KELLY

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>               Shit!!  Hank!!

     The boat is zooming toward her.  It arrives.  As Keough and
     Burke go to pull her aboard, we see a dark shadow rising.

<b>                         BURKE
</b>                    (screaming)
               Look out!!

     looms over him.  He looks up.

<b>     HIS P.O.V.

     There is no boat.  We can't see it, just a big shadowy mass.

<b>     RESUME HECTOR

               gotta yell.


<b>     EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

     And they quickly pull Hector on board, all attention is on
     Hector as they lean over to rescue him.  On the far right... two
     eyes... moving closer to the oblivious rescuers.

     Slowly moving in, everybody is so preoccupied with Hector,
     Deputy Burke, at the end of the boat, is leaning way over to see
     Hector.  If only he knew what he's not seeing.  The eyes come
     closer.  They're now in the water right below Burke's head.  How
     can he not see it?  A beat.  Another beat.  Then... suddenly, a
     mouth, a dragon, teeth, something, flashes from the water--
     snap.  And Deputy Burke's head is simply gone as his limp body
     hangs over the boat.  Kelly screams in horror.

     In a microsecond, Burke's head and life are both gone.  OFF
     their stunned faces, as Kelly continues to scream we:

<b>                         KELLY

     into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic.

               nightmare that I was headless.

     Keough turns to stare at him with incredulity.

               I'd be on the ground looking up at
               my body, no head, walking around
               bumping into everything.  And my
               parents wouldn't let me in the
               house 'cause they'd just bought all
               these new antique lamps and they
               were afraid I'd knock them over,
               made sense, and meanwhile, the
               neighborhood bullies would see my
               round little head on the ground
               looking like a ball, and they'd
               come rushing over to start up a
               game of soccer.  I'd actually feel
               grateful just for being allowed
               into the contest, that's esteem for
               you, what are your thoughts?

     Keough has had enough of this guy.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (a powder keg)
               You know, Hector, I'm sure you're
               a fine person in your own mental
               way.  But I think it would be best
               if you and I didn't speak.

     And Keough heads off.  He takes about four steps... then SNAP.
     Up goes his upside-down body like a rocket.  He's stepped in
     Hector's spring-bow trap.  A beat.  He swings upside-down like
     a pendulum.  Another beat.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               This is a setback.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               You don't want to cut me down.
               'Cause I'll kill you.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Hard to believe there could be a
               monster under such peacefulness.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I thought I might track the
               shoreline tomorrow, look for
               prints.

     She just stares out as if she didn't hear.  And he fixes his own
     stare on her.  Feeling it, she turns, catches him looking at
     her, he diverts the stare.  She feigns a non-reaction.  A beat.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>               You know they say the brain
               confuses fear for passion.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Excuse me?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               When you get scared, the brain

               in high school, the thing to do was
               to take the girl to a scary movie.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               What are you talking about?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I'm saying between the moonlight,
               a beautiful lake and a monster that
               bites heads off... you look good.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm
               all moist.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Forgive me for trying to be nice.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Nice?  Nice would be "you look
               pretty," nice is not some man-
               eating monster has tricked my brain
               into making you look good.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I didn't say it like that.

<b>                         KELLY

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I was trying to pay you a
               compliment, I was guising it as
               science 'cause I know you're
               comfortable in that arena.
               Science.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               A man just died, you're hitting on
               me with science.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Just forget it.

<b>                         HECTOR

               Beg pardon?  Sorry to intrude but
               Hank seems to have gotten himself
               stuck in a tree.


<b>     EXT. CAMPSITE - SECONDS LATER
</b>
     Hank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as Hector, Kelly,
     and Jack approach.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               I probably could've accomplished
               freeing him myself but he had a
               look of mayhem on his upside down
               face.

     They arrive.  Hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Hank?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (calmly)
               Yes.

     The three exchange looks.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Are you okay?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (calmly; almost sweet)
               Other than feeling slightly
               embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.
                    (then)
               Could you cut me down?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Promise you won't kill me, first.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (calmly)
               I have no interest in ever looking
               at you, Hector.
                    (again)
               Could you please cut me down?

     Jack gives Kelly a knife.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You cut, we'll hold him.

     Hector and Jack grab hold, Kelly cuts, they lower him to the
     ground.  He rises.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (calm)
               Thank you.
                    (then)
               I lied.

     And he charges after Hector, who runs toward the beach.  Keough
     chases, Jack and Kelly pursue, trying to stop him.  And
     suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging
     GROWL.  An attack.  Screams all over, a half-second of confusion
     before we SEE it's a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the
     darkness, right at Hector.  Hector dives out of its path.
     Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs.
     Seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water
     the giant jaws of a crocodile.

     In a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it,
     slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water.

     The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only
     be one outcome here.  In a matter of seconds, both bear and
     crocodile have vanished.  And the water is calm again.

<b>     ANGLE THE FACES
</b>
     Utter catatonia.  Shock.  Whatever they expected to find in this
     expedition, they weren't remote prepared for that.  There are
     no words here.  Shock is pre-empting every other human sensory.
     What they just saw... a crocodile head measuring five feet rise
     up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear.  A beat.  Then--

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (admitting)
               Okay.  It's a crocodile.  I'll
               admit it.

     A beat as they gulp air.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (to Jack)
               You're cut.

     There is a little blood over Jack's right eye.  He dabs it.

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                    (to Hector)
               He was an Indo-pacific.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (daunted)
               Are you sure?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Scales were oval.  It was an Asian
               crocodile.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Asia?  How... how could he get
               here?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong
               flushed him down a toilet.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               He had to be thirty feet long.

     Another beat.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (charged)
               Hank.  The little cannon you
               brought, get it.  Guard the
               shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done.
               We made the I.D., our job is
               finished.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I
               wanna know why that monster is
               here.  You got a theory?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Why he's that big, I don't know.
               Why he's here... the wetlands are
               being developed, crocodiles are
               moving.  Australia, Fiji, the
               things have started to cross
               oceans.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               But why Maine and why alone?  Crocs
               are social, why's this guy on the
               move by himself?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Maybe he doesn't play well with
               others.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Is everything a big fucking joke to
               you?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (re his groin)
               Bite my bishop.

     And Keough starts for him, but Jack intercedes.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               I'm sick of him!

<b>               JACK                       HECTOR
</b>           (interceding)        Let him go!  I'm sick of you
       C'mon.                   too, let him go.
                                      (then)
                                Thing about being rich, Sheriff,
                                my parents had the added luxury of
                                being able to ditch me off at Karate
                                school, I'm a brown belt.  So go
                                ahead.  Take your best shot.

     Keough throws a haymaker, decking Hector.  Lays him out.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Hank!

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (who knew?)
               He said he knew Karate!

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (shaken)
               At school they'd always say "go"
               first.

               Get your big gun and guard the

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (muttering as he goes)
               He never said "go".

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to Keough)
               Get the gun.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (muttering as he goes)
               If I fall into a hole or get
               hoisted into a tree...

     And he's gone.

</b>                    (re Keough and Hector)
               Like little children.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I couldn't believe... did you see
               the size of that thing's mouth?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I wonder if he's some kind of
               mutant.
                    (then)
               That bear had to be surprised.

</b>                    (taking her arm; ushering)
               Let's get away from the shore.

     She looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self-
     consious.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>               Sorry.

<b>                         KELLY

     They hold a look.


<b>     EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

     We are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake.  A

     six teenagers, including Janine, and TOM, STEVE, DANNY, CAROL,
     ELLEN.  They've been drinking but they're not sloppy drunk.  As
     they climb out, Tom points to a swing rope which extends from
     the branch of a tree that overhangs the water.

               really even gotten dirty before,
               with me showers have always been
               preventative.

     Their eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and
     nervous.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               That's why you're here.  To get in
               the middle of something?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Maybe.  I've always read about
               what's happened.  I've never... I
               know it sounds silly but, it's nice
               to be someplace while something is
               actually... y'know... happening.

     Something is happening right now.  A beat.

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>               We should probably go to bed.
                    (quickly)
               Get rest, get some rest.  Go to our
               separate beds, get some rest.

     The Freudian slip of her life.  They hold another look.  Then he
     starts to exit.  He stops at the door, turns back.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Thanks for the... bandaid.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (please don't go)
               Night.

     He holds another look, then leaves.  OFF her punishing herself
     for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment
     short.

<b>     EXT.  LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT
</b>
     The teenagers are now skinny-dipping, having a grand ol'
     flirtatious time.  As they splash and frolic and cop their
     feels, we ANGLE... about fifty yards away.  Two eyes pop above
     the surface... followed by the snout.  GO TO:

<b>     THE CROC'S P.O.V.
</b>
     Six fresh delicious teenagers.  Midnight buffet.

<b>     RESUME
</b>
     the croc as he slowly starts to move.  The teenagers start to
     take turns, swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the
     shoreline.  As they laugh and yell, Danny swings on a long
     rope... landing with a splash.  About ten feet from the croc,
     waiting stealth-like, his eyes barely above surface.  He could
     easily go for Danny... but he somehow knows the service will get
     better.  As Danny swims back to shore, Janine takes hold of the
     rope.

<b>                         JANINE
</b>               Here I come.  Ready or not.

     And she swings away... a better swing than Danny's... and she
     splashes down about five feet from the eyes.  Again, the eyes
     don't move.  The teenagers cheer Janine's record-setting swing
     as Tom takes hold of the rope.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>               All or nothing, Tom.

<b>                         TOM
</b>               From the jaws of defeat...

     And he flies away.  It's a leap to die for.  As he splashes
     down... gulp.  Like a seal grabbing a fish... and Tommy has
     vanished.  The kids, cheering at the leap, stop cheering when
     Tommy fails to resurface.  A beat.  They first think he's
     playing a joke.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>               Ha ha.

     Another beat.  Still no sign of Tommy.

<b>                         JANINE
</b>                    (still in the water)
               Tommy?
                    (then)
               This isn't funny, Tommy.

     And now they're concerned.  They all move down toward the shore.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>               Tommy?

<b>                         DANNY
</b>               C'mon,  Tommy.

     And now they're starting to panic.

<b>                         JANINE
</b>               Where is he?

<b>                         DANNY
</b>                    (yelling)
               This isn't funny!!

     Suddenly-- thrusting up out of the water.  The crocodile, Tommy
     in its jaws.  Bloodcurdling screams from all as we:

</b>               What's that?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               It came from across the lake.

     Keough, Jack, and Deputy Stevens are in the boat, zooming
     towards the teenagers.

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         JANINE
</b>               He just took him in his jaws.

<b>     REVEAL
</b>
<b>     EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT
</b>
     The teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on.
     Hector's chopper is hovering over the area, its beams lighting
     the water.  Lying on the beach, covered... is Tommy.  Alive.
     And basically unhurt!

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               He was in his mouth?!

<b>                         JANINE
</b>               Yes.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (stunned; to Tommy)
               You're okay?

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>                    (in shock)
               I think; just cuts.

<b>                         DANNY
</b>               The thing just came up out of the
               water and kind of spit him at us.

<b>                         JANINE
</b>               You should have signs posted, for
               God's sake!

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (examining him)
               You're really okay?

     Tommy nods.  Then--

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>               I might need a Tetanus.

     Keough and Jack exchange a look of disbelief.


<b>     EXT. CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER
</b>
     Hector, Keough, Jack, and Kelly, looking tired, trek toward
     their tents.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Just spit him back out.  Some shall
               live, some shall die, arbitrarily,
               sound like any higher power we

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (dismissive)
               He didn't eat the kid cause he'd
               just swallowed a bear.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest
               God--

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               I'm tired, Hector.  I know this
               because you're beginning to not bug
               me.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               That sounds good but underneath
               it's hurtful.
                    (then)
               Nightcap?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Raincheck.

     They're growing on each other.  Jack and Kelly exchange a smile.
     Hector and Keough are developing an odd kinship almost.  They
     continue on as Jack and Kelly stop at her tent.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Well.  Goodnight.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               We seem to say goodnight a lot.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               We could not say it and...
                    (suddenly a coward)
               Well, that thing is ambulatory if
               you want somebody in your tent
               to...

     She smiles.  Then:

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Night.

     He holds another look.  She goes into her tent.  He stands
     there.  A beat.  Waits to see if she calls him back.  She
     doesn't.  He then heads off.  Her head pops out.  Watches him
     go.  Almost calls after him.  Doesn't.


<b>     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</b>
     We see the campsite, looking at it from the water.  All is
     still.  After a beat.  An eye blink.  We are not looking at the
     campsite.  We are CLOSE ON an EYE, REFLECTING the campsite.
     Another blink.  Still another.  We HEAR a slight SNARL.  Then:

<b>                                             DISSOLVE TO:

<b>     EXT. LAKE - SUNRISE
</b>
     Hector and Deputy Gare, inside the chopper, lifting of, to

<b>     EXT. SHORE - (DIFFERENT PART OF THE LAKE) - SUNRISE
</b>
     Kelly, Jack, Keough, and Stevens searching for tracks along the
     wooded shoreline, staying a good six feet from the actual shore.
     Their senses are very heightened.  Keough has his cannon gun.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Get back from the shore.  We know
               how fast he can leap out.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               We shouldn't even really be doing
               this.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               They won't be here till at least
               noon.  We got a few hours to kill.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               So does he.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (obsessing)
               I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it.
               They're drawn to me.  I got a thing
               about ticks.

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I heard something.

     He's staring at a brush thicket.  After a beat, we HEAR a slight
     RUSTLE.  The guns go up quickly.  A beat.  Nothing.  Jack bends
     down, picks up a stone.  Tosses it into the thicket.  And out it
     charges.  Kelly screams, they're all about to fire before they
     realize it's only a beaver.  It scurries into the water.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (trying to gather herself)
               Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (suddenly)
               Look.

<b>     ANGLE A GIANT PAW PRINT
</b>
     embedded in the mud.  It must be two feet in diameter.

<b>     RESUME

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to Keough)
               Guard the water.

     Kelly and Jack go quickly to examine the print.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>               That's pretty big.


<b>     EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

     The chopper is descending.  Hector and Gare are inside.

<b>                         GARE
</b>               It seems like we're getting lower.

<b>                         HECTOR

<b>                         GARE

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               'Cause this is the cove he

</b>                    (alarmed)
               So why are we landing?
                    (then)
               Hector.


<b>     EXT. SHORE - CONTINUOUS

     Kelly and Jack are still working on the footprint.  Physical
     proximity, which they're both a little distracted by.

<b>                         KELLY

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         KELLY
</b>                    (annoyed)
               I'm not mushing it.

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I'm not mushing it.

     Suddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot, scaring all
     of them, but particularly Kelly who jumps.  Her foot lands on a
     long extended branch, and even more suddenly Burke's severed
     head seesaws out of the shallow water, hitting her in the shin.
     She screams as they all jump back.

<b>     ANGLE THE HEAD
</b>
<b>     RESUME

     They just stare, as Kelly continues to scream.

<b>                         JACK

               Okay.  Okay.  Okay.

<b>                         KELLY

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I'm being very calm.  I'm composed.
               This is the second time I've been
               hit with a severed head, I'm

</b>               I can't recognize him from the
               back.  It looks like him.

     Keough takes a stick.  Squeamish, he tentatively pokes the head,
     trying to turn it over.

<b>     ANGLE THE HEAD
</b>
     It is Burke.

<b>     RESUME

     Keough leans in for a closer look.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               That's him.
                    (re something)
               What the...?

     Something appears to be in his mouth.  Keough takes a small
     twig, pries back a cheek... the mouth is full of worms.

<b>                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)

<b>     EXT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Mrs. Bickerman, singing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" is happily leading
     the blinded cow to the shore.  The cow, tentative, just allows
     itself to be led, not knowing what the plan is.  As Mrs.
     Bickerman gets to the water, she looks out to the croc.

     And with that, she whips the hind of the cow causing it to jump
     forward.  Almost simultaneously, the croc makes its charge and
     the cow is dead before it has a clue.

     Keough, Kelly, and Jack are questioning a slightly hostile Mrs.
     Bickerman.

<b>                         BICKERMAN
</b>                    (indignant)
               I haven't broken any laws.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (bordering on
                     condescension)
               Oh, but you have, Ma'am.  You lied
               to us, that could be obstruction of
               justice.  A man's been killed in
               part 'cause of your silence, I
               could make out a charge of reckless
               endangerment and I'm sure PETA
               would be annoyed at how you treat
               your cows.

<b>                         BICKERMAN
</b>               The reason I lied is if I'd told
               you the truth, you'd just hunt it
               down and kill it which seems to be
               exactly what you're doing.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               How long have you been feeding this
               thing?

<b>                         BICKERMAN
</b>               About six years.  He first appeared
               in May of nineteen-ninety-one.
               Bernie was out fishing and it
               followed him home.  So we threw him
               some scraps and well... he didn't
               seem to bother anybody.  He became
               kind of like a pet who lived in the
               wild.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               He just appeared.  You have no idea
               how he arrived in this lake?

<b>                         BICKERMAN
</b>               No.  Do you?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You
               didn't, by any chance, lead him to
               the lake blindfolded?

</b>                    (offended)
               No, I did not.
                    (then)
               The crocodile did kill him, though.
               But it was all... it was a mistake.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               A mistake.

<b>                         BICKERMAN
</b>               One of our horses got loose two
               years ago, went to the lake to
               drink and... well the crocodile
               started coming in, Bernie went to
               intercede and... it was all a
               terrible misunderstanding.
                    (then)
               If I reported it, they would've
               sent people to kill it.

     Keough, Kelly and Jack can't quite believe what they're hearing.
     Then--

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Ma'am, how could you not report
               this?  He puts human life at risk
               and--

<b>                         BICKERMAN
</b>               Nobody lives on this lake.  it's
               really his lake now.

                    (through walkie-talkie)
               He went swimming.

<b>     EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Hector is underwater, exploring.


<b>     ANGLE GARE ON THE CHOPPER
</b>
     Her radar is up, she heard something.  But she doesn't see
     anything.  She scans the surface closely.


<b>     EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims.  Other than
     the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing
     extraordinary.  Then, a flash shadow looms over him.  He looks
     up, but sees nothing.  Probably just the sun ducking under a
     cloud.  It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head
     for the surface.  He swims upward.


<b>     EXT. LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Hector breaks the top.  Lifts his mask, looks toward the
     chopper, which he sees about forty yards out.  He continues to
     breaststroke on the surface.  Suddenly... the croc's head rises
     up right behind Hector, who's oblivious.  He continues to swim.
     The croc follows.  Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets
     a feeling he's being followed.  He then turns to look the other
     way, upon which his face goes rigid.

<b>     HIS P.O.V.
</b>
     About three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at
     him.

<b>     ANGLE HECTOR
</b>
     ashen.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (weakly)
               Oh.... my.

     The croc doesn't move.  It just stares at him.  Then end of his
     snout is almost touching Hector.  Hector himself doesn't dare
     move, for fear of spooking the croc into action.  We get the
     idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling
     any spiritual voids.  A beat.

<b>                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
</b>               I suddenly feel a bit foolish.
                    (then)
               You're different from the others.

     The croc raises his head now to reveal the snout.  And his
     deadly smile.  Hector just tries to tread water with as little
     motion as possible.  He deathly fears a quick movement will
     cause his life to be over.  Perhaps this is what he came for.
     To be judged by this symbol of mythology.

     He backswims ever so slightly.  The croc pursues just as slowly,
     their eyes are locked.  He could snap off Hector's head in an
     instant.

<b>                         HECTOR (CONT'D)

     Gare still scans the water's surface, looking for any sign of
     Hector.  And her face freezes.  Oh yes, there's the sign.

<b>     HER P.O.V.
</b>
     Hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc
     slowly follows.

<b>                         GARE
</b>               Hector!!

     We can hear the quaking fear in Hector's voice.  As he continues
     to slowly backswim.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (to Gare; forced calm)
               Just turn the ignition, it's fuel
               injected.

     Gare turns the ignition, the ENGINE KICKS and DIES.

<b>                         GARE
</b>               Come on.

     She turns it again and the ENGINE TURNS OVER.

<b>     ANGLE HECTOR
</b>
     The crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and
     closer toward the chopper.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               I know under the circumstances,
               biting off my head might seem
               viable.  It would cheapen you.

     But nothing's funny about this to Hector now.  What he's staring
     into is death.  His own.  Gare raises her rifle.

<b>                         GARE
</b>               I might get a shot.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (fear in his voice)
               No.  If you don't kill him
               instantly, I'm dead and you'll only
               kill him instantly if you get his
               brain, which is about the size of
               a cherry.  And even if you were on
               target, a bullet might not
               penetrate his hide.

               About twelve more yards.  Keep
               coming just like that.

<b>     ANGLE HECTOR
</b>
     craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye
     contact with the CROCODILE, it GROWLS.  Hector quickly locks
     eyes with him again.

<b>     ANGLE GARE
</b>
<b>                         GARE
</b>                    (weakly)
               Oh my God.

<b>     RESUME
</b>
     By now Hector is almost to the chopper, the croc is right there
     too.  Hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though
     it's impossible to discern why.  The crocodile seems poised to
     finish him.  There's a slight GROWL.

     And then suddenly, a small underwater POP, followed by an
     EXPLOSION out of the water.  it's an inflatable life vest and as
     it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it.

     As the croc goes for the vest, Hector makes his dash for the
     chopper.  In almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the
     croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater.

     Hector's up on the chopper's ski.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Move over!!

     The crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws
     snapping shut, missing Hector by an inch, maybe two.  Hector
     dives into the chopper, screaming.

<b>                         GARE
</b>               Go!!

     She REVS the CHOPPER.  The croc comes up again, chomping down on
     one of the landing skis.  Both Gare and Hector scream as the
     whole helicopter is jerked mightily.

<b>                         GARE (CONT'D)

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               I'm trying!!!

     The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to
     thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open.  Gare
     FIRES her REVOLVER.  It might as well shoot BB's.  The croc is 
     undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up
     and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Just heard from Wildlife and
               Florida Fish And Game.  They should
               be here by four.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Okay.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               We might as well pack.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Good idea.

<b>                         HECTOR (O.S.)
</b>               They'll kill him.

     They turn to see, Hector is standing there.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               They're not going to be able to
               snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in
               water, he drowns.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               They could try to tranq him on

</b>                    (knowing)
               They won't.  He's taken human life,
               the mission will be to put him
               down.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Gee, that would really disappoint
               me.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Forget about him being God, he's
               thirty feet long, he is a miracle
               of nature, who somehow made his way
               to Maine.  This is a grand beast.
               A grand dragon.  An attempt should
               at least be made to capture him
               alive.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Well, you can try talking them into
               that, if--

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               I have enough flaxedil with me to

</b>               Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when
               they come, they will kill it.  They
               have to, politically, he's too
               dangerous, if something were to go
               wrong... the odds are he will be
               destroyed,--

</b>        Which is exactly          Please, Hank, let me finish
        what...                 I'm having a sane moment, this
                                  is a window.

<b>                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
</b>               If he were neutralized when they
               got here... they might consider
               saving him.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               And how would we neutralize him?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               We lure him on land and pump him
               with the drugs.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               No way.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's
               probably a hundred and fifty years
               old, he's bigger than an elephant.

     Hector's impassioned here, he's not fooling around.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               So maybe Wildlife will try to save
               him, they're more equipped to--

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               We both know what they'll do.

     Silence.  Admission by silence.  Then--

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Even if we could tranq him-- how
               would we get him on land.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Other than to eat us?

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               He follows anything that moves.
               You guys can be in the trucks with
               tranq guns.  If he charges, drive
               off, plus Hank you've got your hand-
               held cannon.  We could do this with
               no safety risk.  If it works, we
               save a beast that should be saved.

     A beat.  They are sympathetic to the idea.

               on land?

<b>                         HECTOR

     Incredibly... the plan is working.  A giant dragon is following
     a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline.

     Hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore.  The
     big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank
     steak.  The time is now.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Keep firing!

     The men continue to pump the beast with tranquilizing darts.


<b>     INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Hector's having trouble righting his chopper.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Motherfucker.


<b>     EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow, snapping
     off the cable.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Shit!!

     And down comes to the chopper, Hector cannot control it.  It
     crashes into the lake.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Hector!!

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to Keough)
               Take him.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               I can't.  I'll get Hector!!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Where is he?!

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               We gotta get to Hector!!

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to the driver)
               Back us in a little, we need to get
               a shot!

     Hector pops his head out of the overturned chopper.  He looks
     around.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Where is he?

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to the Deputies)
               Tranq guns down, rifles up!

     The men switch guns, under--

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>                    (yelling to Hector)
               Do not go in that water!
                    (to the driver)
               Back us in!!

     As the pick-up backs closer to the shore--

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>                    (to Keough)
               If you get a safe shot...

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               I'll take it!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Hector.  Do not move.

     The water is calm again.  A beat.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>                    (to Gare)
               You see anything?

<b>                         GARE
</b>                    (looking through binocs)
               Nothing.  Maybe he swam out.

     Upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging
     the truck.  Screams.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Go!!  Drive!!

     The pick-up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing Keough off
     balance.  The croc heads back for the water as Keough regains
     his balance.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>               Take him!!

     And Keough blasts.  It detonates the ground near the croc
     causing him to surge airborne into the water.  And he goes
     under.  Silence.  A beat.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Did you get him?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               I don't know.
                    (to the Driver)
               Back the truck--

<b>                         ALL
</b>               No!!!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Hector, you see anything?

<b>     ANGLE HECTOR
</b>
     on the pontoon of his chopper.  He's looking about, studying the
     water.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               No!

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (sarcastic)
               I just have this feeling
               everything's totally safe.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (yelling)
               I see blood.  Maybe you got him,
               Hank.

     And as Hector looks further.  Behind him... up surfaces the
     crocodile in all his stealth.  His head is two feet from Hector
     and nobody knows it.  Least of all Hector.

<b>                         HECTOR (CONT'D)
</b>               I can't see him, but this is
               definitely blood.  Maybe you got
               him.

     And as he turns back, he sees it.  The croc comes up as Hector
     screams, jumps off.  Screams.  Keough leaps off the truck and
     charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give
     Hector some cover.

     Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  He
     climbs in.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Where is he?!

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               I don't know!

     No sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  As he springs
     toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other
     side.  The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin
     and he becomes wedged.  The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes
     right through the chopper.  He's not completely immobilized but
     wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Hector!!

     But now Jack has joined, rifle in hand.  Hector surfaces again,
     swimming for shore.  Jack runs to help him onto land.

<b>                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
</b>                    (taking aim)
               Alright.  Game over.

     But the croc looks feeble now.  He lets out this MOAN of DEATH.
     And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger.

<b>                         KEOUGH (CONT'D)
</b>                    (to Kelly)
               Should I?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Wait.

<b>     RESUME
</b>
     The croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach.
     But there's no rage in his behavior now.  He seems desperate.
     He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two
     ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I think the drugs are kicking in.

     Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to
     free himself from the mangled wreckage.  As unbelievable as that
     cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even
     more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  A thirty foot
     exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  And he
     just cannot go on anymore.

     Kelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back.  They approach with
     caution.  They all stare at the tired crocodile.

<b>     ANGLE THE CROC
</b>
     He's now looking back.  Bleeding, gasping... beaten.  In his
     eyes... we can see it.  The beast is beaten.

<b>     ANGLE THE PRINCIPLES
</b>
     There's no triumph.  In their eyes... sadness.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I don't think we really want to
               wait for him to catch his breath.

     It continues to breathe heavily.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               He's through fighting.  Look at
               him.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I don't care.  Hank.  End it.

     Keough raises his cannon.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               No.  Look.  He's got nothing left.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Yeah and every time we think
               there's no more danger--

     Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the
     water, seizing Hector.  Screams.  It death rolls Hector, flings
     him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.
     Keough blasts his Avenger.  A direct hit.

     It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing
     into the air.  It splashes down, the first head not to hit
     Kelly.

     They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore.  He's
     bleeding.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               I'm okay.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               You're not okay, your leg's a mess.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Get him onto shore.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               He heeds a tourniquet.

     Keough quickly peels off his shirt.  Gives it to Kelly, who goes
     to work.

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>               You're gonna be okay.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Guess I finally got bit.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix
               it.

     A sudden ROAR.  Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see...
     the big croc.  Maybe his final roar, he looks weak.  GASPING in
     the crashed chopper.  Jack and Keough approach.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (quietly; re the big croc)
               He's done.  He's dying.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Don't count on it.
                    (then)
               We better take him out.

     But something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at
     them... nobody wants wants to take him out.

<b>     ANGLE THE CROC
</b>
     looking back at them.  He knows he's in their hands now.  He
     knows.

<b>     ANGLE THE HUMANS
</b>
     A beat.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>                    (quiet)
               Flax him under his tail.  Two
               hundred cc's.  Under the tail,
               that'll put him to sleep.

     Upon which we HEAR the SOUND of TRUCKS.  Florida Fish And Game,
     U.S. Wildlife, arriving on the scene.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Thank God.

     OFFICER COLSON, Florida Fish And Game, emerges, approaches.
     Stares with utter disbelief.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               We need to get it some medical
               help.
                    (re Hector)
               And him too.

     By now the Florida army has moved in.  They all stare with the
     same suspended disbelief.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (explaining)
               We trapped him with our chopper.

<b>                                             DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>     EXT. BEACH - AN HOUR LATER
</b>
     A crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying
     to free it from the wreckage.  FIND the PARAMEDICS with Hector,
     on a stretcher.  Jack, Kelly, and Keough are there.

<b>                         PARAMEDIC
</b>               We're gonna airvac him to Portland.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Okay.
                    (to Hector)
               That's where they're taking the
               croc, Hector, they've got some big
               tank there.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               He's gonna live?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Yeah.  Thanks to you.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               And Hank.
                    (to Keough)
               I know you weren't really trying to
               hit him.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (gently)
               I was aiming for you.

     Hector smiles.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Thanks for the rescue.

     Jack leans down.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You take care.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               You talk to Bickerman?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               She didn't tell us about the other
               croc 'cause she was afraid we'd
               blow it's head off.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>               Women's intuition.  Are there
               anymore?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Just those two.

<b>                         PARAMEDIC
</b>               We gotta take him.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Okay.

<b>                         PARAMEDIC
</b>               We got room for one.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Well... I got stuff to pack up
               and...

     He looks to Kelly, but before she can say "yes"--

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>                    (grudging)
               I'll go.

     Hector smiles.  The Paramedics board Hector.  Keough turns to
     Jack.

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               Thanks for your help.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You too.

     Handshake.  Respect.  That's about as much affection as you get
     from Keough.  He then extends his hand to Kelly.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               I'm sure this would offend you on
               principal but... could we keep in
               touch?

<b>                         KEOUGH
</b>               I guess.

     And she kisses him on the cheek.  Keough fights off his blush,
     boards the chopper.  As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Well...

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               No, no, I'll be a while anyway.
               I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You sure?  I don't mind...

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               No, I actually want to stay for a
               little while.

     They hold a look.  Then--

<b>                         KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>               I'll miss you most of all
               scarecrow.

     And she kisses his cheek.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               If I'm ever in New York...

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Yeah.

     They hold another look.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Y'know, if we didn't live in
               separate worlds and...

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               But we do.

               Hey, we'll always have Maine.

     He smiles.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               It was... something meeting you.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Likewise.

     He kisses her hand.  Holds a look.  Heads off.

<b>     EXT. BEACH - DUSK
</b>
     The tents are down, everything's packed.  A couple trucks
     remain.  The croc is gone.  Things are quiet.  Kelly stands down
     by the water, staring out.

<b>     HER P.O.V.
</b>
     Hypnotic beauty.  The lake doesn't even ripple.  She soaks it in
     as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to
     this again.  She HEARS every BIRD.  Including a DISTANT LOON.
     Serenity has returned.  Then suddenly... a stone goes skipping
     out, four, five, six skips.  Kelly turns around.  Jack stands
     there.  They hold a look.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I thought I should say goodbye to

     He approaches.  Takes her hand.

               Different worlds, Jack.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Yeah, I thought about that as I was
               driving... and... I haven't found
               somebody in my world.  You found
               anyone in yours?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               No.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               So I was thinking... maybe if I met
               anybody in my world who was good
               for you and if you know somebody in
               New York good for me, we could fix
               each other up.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               You think?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Worth a try.  We don't wanna be
               alone forever, do we?

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Probably not.

     They hold a look.  He kisses her softly.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               That was... y'know if the guy asks
               me can she kiss, now I'll be able
               to tell him if you can.

<b>                         KELLY
</b>               Good thinking.

     And they kiss again, this one escalates a little.  They break.
     And then he holds her.  Tightly as the CAMERA PULLS UP to an
     AERIAL VIEW of them, embracing at the water's edge.

<b>     EXT. MAINE TURNPIKE - AERIAL SHOT - DUSK
</b>
     Police cars, lights flashing, motor down the highway.  Behind
     them... on a flatbed truck... a thirty foot giant crocodile.
     Headed down the southbound lane of the Maine turnpike.  Rolling.
     Rolling.  Rolling along.  It doesn't even look ridiculous.
     We've become accustomed to such sights.

     As we lift up higher and higher, Richie Havens' "I CAN SEE

     Jack and Kelly board his vehicle.  They drive off, as we:

<b>     EXT. BICKERMAN FARM - SUNSET
</b>
     Daffy Mrs. Bickerman sits at the end of her dock, feet dangling
     in the water.  Throwing bread crumbs.

               you.  Come eat your supper little
               buttons.  Nibble Mommy's toes.

<b>     REVEAL

     Three, maybe four, crocodile hatchlings, a foot in length, are
     swimming near her feet, eating the bread, nibbling her toes.
     OFF them, THEN happy Mrs. Bickerman, we:
