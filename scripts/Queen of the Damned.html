<b>1   EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT               1

    An empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. We
    hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, then nineteenth-
    century boots ENTER FRAME. We FOLLOW them strolling past
    the headstones and mausoleums. The sound of a HORSE and
    CARRIAGE ECHOES in the distance.

<b>                             VOICE (V.O.)
</b>               There comes a time for every vampire
               when the idea of eternity becomes
               momentarily unbearable...

    As we REACH an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and OUT
    OF FRAME. PAN UP to reveal:

    A FIGURE stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb,
    silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird.

<b>                       VOICE (V.O.)
</b>               The wounds suffered from love and
               failed friendships don't heal like
               a human's, but seem to only gape
               larger. The longing to be mortal
               returns, a longing for finiteness.

    A beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night...

    The figure enters an alabaster tomb and closes the door.

<b>                        VOICE (V.O.)
</b>               In 1883 I suffered such a spell
               and decided to cease feeding on
               blood. Just lie in the earth and
               let time return to its natural
               state...

    As the WIND PICKS UP, the LEAVES of a fledgling vine
    growing up the side of the tomb begin to RATTLE FASTER
    and FASTER, until curiously, time seems to speed up.
    Night passes to day and back to night. Shadows from the
    sun and moon drift across the tomb. As days and months
    fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns
    all around the tomb.

<b>                         VOICE (V.O.)
</b>                 I had hoped the sounds of the
                 passing eras would fade out, and a
                 kind of death might happen. A
                 kind of forgetting where I would
                 be healed from my wounds.

    The CLIP-CLOP of HORSES and the SQUEAK of PERAMBULATORS
    DISSOLVE INTO the THUMP and SCRAPE of INDUSTRIAL ENGINES.

<b>                         VOICE (V.O.)
</b>                 But as I lay there, the sounds
                 didn't fade but grew with the
                 world.

    The BUZZ of PROP ENGINES MELT INTO the sound of a JET
    STREAMING overhead. CARS, MACHINES, RADIO BROADCASTS
    MERGE INTO a medley of MUSIC from this century -- JACK
<b>    BENNY, MUDDY WATERS, ELVIS, HENDRIX, SEX PISTOLS.
</b>
<b>                         VOICE (V.O.)
</b>                 And gradually the world didn't
                 sound like the place I had left,
                 but something different...
                 better...

    As we DRAW CLOSER TO the now vine-covered tomb, SOUNDS of
    the '70s, '80s, '90s PERSIST...

<b>                         VOICE (V.O.)
</b>                 A new fearless attitude had
                 possessed the world, brave and
                 Godless. I began to wonder if it
                 was not time to resurrect. But
                 the thing that eventually brought
                 me back -- the decisive thing
                 really -- came like a bolt out of
                 the blue.

    GUITARS STRIKE, DRUMS CRACK and the MUSIC SLAMS OUT, raw
    and dark.

    Slender hands with long, painted nails, Gothic rings, and
    a half-pound of silver bracelets play their instruments.
    Long hair, body piercings, Celtic tattoos, and brightly- colored
    nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. In the
    confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or
    girl, but they're all young and beautiful. Breaking in
    on the CACOPHONY of MUSIC COMES ONE GUITAR CLOSER and
    LOUDER than the rest.

     A SCRAPING ROAR, like a bandsaw being twisted into the
     most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its
     emotion.

                  vampiric, I had no doubt it could
                  be heard in Hades. I had no
                  choice... it summoned me.

     An ULTRA-FAST TECHNO BEAT BEGINS and the FULL-SOUND of a
     BAND RUSHES in, creating a sense of vertigo with its
     energy.

     The BAND'S sounds ECHO about the stone chamber, thrumming
     a deep, life-giving pulse. Suddenly, the LID of a
     SARCOPHAGUS SCRAPES and slides to one side.

     The Figure re-emerges from the tomb, his cape now in
     tatters -- posture bent. He creeps across the cemetery
     in unnatural, staccato movements as if hindered by the
     physics of distance and time. All the while the SONG
     plays, drawing the figure toward it.

     The Figure moves through the shadows avoiding the spill
     of yellow light from the street lamps. Stopping in a
     darkened alleyway, he gasps for air, exhausted by his movements.
      He listens again to the mesmeric TUNE of the
     band in the distance, when -- From down the alley, a
     voice...

     Pulling deeper into the shadows, the caped Figure beckons
     the dealer over. The man approaches when -- With a wild
     animal cry, the Figure lunges like a phantom -- A flash of teeth
     -- The Dealer is on the ground -- the Figure set
     upon him. OVER this scene the BAND'S SONG RUSHES IN LOUD again,
     reaching an incredible CRESCENDO as the violent
     frenzy continues -- the monster gnawing at the Dealer's
     neck.

     Rising from his victim we see for the first time the
     revitalized face of this creature, a mane of blond hair
     frames the beautiful features of the VAMPIRE LESTAT --
     his bulbous lips glistening red.

                  the music, or the 100 years of
                  rest, I'm not sure, but suddenly I
                  was feeling better than ever. My
                  appetite for living was voracious.
                  My hearing so exact I could locate
                  precisely the source of the
                  music...

     In the street, Lestat emerges from the shadows in the
     dealer's snug-fitting leather outfit. He looks up at an
     extremely run-down flophouse...

</b>                  My old house.

     High in the attic, a single window glows with dim light.
     The source of the MUSIC. The whole house is shaking from
     the sound of the BAND playing upstairs.

     REVEAL the band members of Satan's Night Out. JAMES,
     ALEX and MAUDY stare at each other as if in some tantric
     trance, as they play their music -- Alex's long fingers
     climbing up and down his guitar, Maudy's waifish body
     sensually curls around her keyboard, the waves of music
     flowing through them while James, on drums, drives them
     further into it.

<b>                          LESTAT (V.O.)
</b>                  It was hard to believe these
                  beings were mortal -- so confident
                  in their skin. Everything in my
                  body wanted to be with them. I
                  couldn't help myself.

     Then, from somewhere in the room, an ANGELIC VOICE begins
     to hum the most hypnotic melody over the tune, melding in
     exquisite harmony. Arching her neck in some higher
     ecstasy, Maudy looks across the makeshift studio and
     suddenly stops playing.

<b>                          ALEX
</b>                  What the hell, Maudy.

     Seeing Maudy's stunned face, Alex and James turn to see
     Lestat perched like a raven on top of the stack of
     speakers, eyes closed, still humming to the fading reverb
     of the guitars. Slowly opening his cool grey eyes --

<b>                          LESTAT
</b>                  Please don't stop.

<b>                          JAMES
</b>                  What the f-- How did you get in
                  here?

<b>                          LESTAT
</b>                  The door, of course.

     James and Alex look at the door on the other side of the
     attic -- they should have seen him. Maudy stares at
     Lestat, quite taken by the handsome vampire's looks --
     Drinking Maudy in with his eyes --

<b>                          LESTAT
</b>                  Your music woke me from the
                  longest sleep. It's sublime. In
                  two hundred years I've never heard
                  anything quite like it.

<b>                          ALEX

     As we REMAIN ON the stunned looks of the band's faces --

<b>                          LESTAT (V.O.)
</b>                  It just rolled out of my mouth.
                  With one simple sentence I had
                  betrayed everything about my kind.
                  Betrayed our code of secrecy.

<b>                          LESTAT
</b>                  Your struggles are over.

     Suddenly from across the room --

<b>                          LESTAT
</b>                  All that you've ever dreamed of
                  will be yours.

     They spin around to see Lestat now right behind them,
     smiling.

     They all stare at him, faces white.     A beat.     Then James
     breaks into a big smile.

<b>                                 JAMES
</b>                  Cool.   We got our very own vampire.

     Maudy and Alex look at each other getting used to it.
     They break into smiles, going with it.

     Girls press their breasts and necks up against the

     herself on the car. Groupies scream with pure
     excitement.

     Confusion of screams as the door to the limo opens. The
     crowd's scream reaches a fever pitch as... James, Alex
     and Maudy climb out, ogle at the sight. ROGER SMYTHE,
     their business manager (40s), gets out next, hustling
     them through the crowd.

     A wave of hysteria hits the fans. Roger hustles the
     band through the crowd and up the stairs into the church,
     past the giant billboard with their own images written
     huge, Lestat's smiling face above them all and the
     announcement --

     reveal a huge monitor on the wall.

     Every eye is glued to the SCREEN... CRACKLE, CRACKLE.
     Nothing. Then suddenly, on the screen, a face in shadow
     appears... Lestat. His voice booms out over the crowd.

     Then Lestat leans forward into the light. Hushed
     whispers move through the crowd. Lestat's eyes burn
     unnaturally bright. His white skin absolutely glows,
     luminous. Lestat smiles out at them with a tight smile.
     Then grins wider, revealing his fangs.

                  wrong, but what I remember about
                  vampires is you guys usually keep
                  your identity secret.

                  to share myself with the world.

     the intersection of a narrow alley. She hesitates,
     nervous, then turns down the dark lane, disappearing into
     the blackness...

     Jesse, from the shadows, gazes, wide-eyed, at the Soho
     private club's entrance, a solitary door with a faded sign
     and a dull blue light mounted above.

     Jesse hears strange whispering. She sees now figures
     moving through the fog. One pushes a buzzer. Jesse stares,
     barely breathing, her heart pounding.

     The figures have white, luminescent faces, strange, bright,
     glowing eyes. Their fingernails are glass-like. A moment
     later, a slot in the door opens. The glowing eyes of another
     creature stares out at them, scrutinizing them. The door
     closes quickly.

     Jesse stands there, deliberating. She takes a step closer
     to the door. Stops. Takes another nervous step. She hears
     something, whirls around.

     Another group of the strange figures walk steadily down the
     street towards her. Jesse begins backing away. A HISSING
     sound slowly fills the alley...

     Lestat's face appears on a video screen in front of a room
     lined from floor to ceiling with leather-bound books, ancient
     scrolls. Subjects are marked, Werewolves, Poltergeists,
     Possession...

     Jesse, making a presentation, stands before an impressive
     and imposing group of 10 TALAMASCANS, wearing demure
     suits.

     Jesse is excited, a bit nervous, hoping to impress. She
     holds a remote which controls images appearing on the
     large video screen. Clips from Lestat's press conference
     continue. Jesse gazes out at the Talamascans.

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                  I have reason to believe Lestat's
                  the real thing. A vampire. And
                  an ancient one.

                  It would appear that way. But
                  have you listened to his songs?
                  Read his lyrics?

     The Talamascans glance at each other, surprised. Shake
     their heads. A few laugh. They're not Lestat's usual
     audience.

                  he refers to a pub called the

                  clue...

                  back streets of Soho?' I tracked
                  down the old leases in London. It
                  turns out, in the late 1700's,
                  there was a pub right in the
                  backstreets of Soho called the
                  Sailor's Arms.

     The lyrics on screen are replaced now by an old engraving
     of a pub with the sign reading "SAILOR'S ARMS."

<b>                                 JESSE

                  Witches' covens, seances, that
                  sort of thing.

     Quick flashes of gruesome drawings appear -- animal
     sacrifices. A corpses floating above a table...

     Jesse talks faster and faster with her enthusiasm.

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                  And most importantly, reports of

                  subsequently attacked by
                  bloodsucking fiends.

     Quick flashes of gruesome period newspaper drawings,
     blood pouring from the neck of a screaming woman. A
     white-faced ghoul with fangs.

     Jesse is smiling wider, excited by her discovery.

     On screen, an old map of London appears.

     Jesse leans forward now as she talks.

</b>                  Yes, but right now there's only

                  exactly the same place. The
                  Waverly Arms.

     On screen, a photo of the Waverly Arms.

     She pauses for emphasis, gazing at the faces of the
     Talamascans, gauging their reactions.

<b>                                JESSE

     Murmurs. Many of definite interest. Some of definite

     Jesse smiles. Pushes a button.     Ready to receive the
     Talamascans' approval.

     On screen, a new picture appears of several figures,
     white faces, dark clothes -- but they're very blurry.

                  be derived from years of research
                  in the Bibliotech de Paris, which
                  seems unlikely for a young rock
                  star in his early twenties. Plus
                  there are historical details
                  dating back hundreds of years
                  Lestat describes that don't exist
                  anywhere... except in our library.
                  He refers to Marius, the great
                  white lord, who ruled over a group
                  of islands off the Bay of Naples
                  in the late 18th Century. What
                  I'm trying to say here, and maybe
                  I'm not doing the best job of it,
                  is that Lestat may be the oldest
                  and most powerful vampire ever
                  documented!

     Jesse sees some of the Talamascans are again listening.
     But Talamascan #1 shakes his head...

<b>                                TALAMASCAN #1

                  would he be forecasting this to
                  the world? He's all but drawn a
                  map and marked an X. What
                  vampires hold sacred is keeping
                  their kind a secret. You never
                  name other immortals, tell where
                  their lairs are. They'd be hunted
                  down.

                  Lestat's not afraid to piss them
                  off. He wants mortals and
                  immortals to know he's there, to
                  know he exists. I don't know
                  why...

                  C'mon. It looks like the Blair
                  witch!

     The Talamascans burst out laughing, even Talamascan #2.
     Jesse gazes at them, her face burning red. She's lost
     them, blown it. Made a fool of herself.

     Her frustration rises, she can no longer contain it.       It
     bursts out of her.

<b>                                JESSE

                  just have to go back and get
                  better, more conclusive evidence!
                  Maybe you just can't unravel all
                  the mysteries of the world out
                  there, by sitting around all day
                  in a dusty old library in here!

     As they gaze at her, astonished, she gathers her
     materials, starts out. Several start shouting back at
     her. Amidst the uproar, a voice booms across the room.

<b>                                 TALBOT (O.S.)
</b>                  Jesse.

     Everyone turns. Quiets down. DAVID TALBOT stands in the
     back of the room. He's clearly the superior Talamascan,
     though younger than some, very charismatic.

<b>                                 TALBOT
</b>                  My office.   Now.

     He turns, walks out. All the Talamascans look at Jesse.
     It doesn't look good. Her face burning red, Jesse turns,
     leaves.

     Bouncer #1 is now making out with one of the young sexy
     girls he let in, trying to get a hand up her dress.

     A cold WIND suddenly blows, fluttering her skirt.    He
     looks up. A dark figure stands in the shadows.

                  here.

     The figure steps from the shadows.    The Bouncer's face
     turns white.

     It's Lestat...

     The Bouncer starts to back way. The girl starts to
     scream. Lestat clamps his hand over the girl's mouth.
     To the girl...

     to him.

      CRUSHING. Over this scene the BAND'S SONG rushes in.

      Surreptitiously, he glances down at a book on his lap --
      its title Vampires -- The Occult Truth. He talks on a

     Unhooking their instruments, Alex and James start to pack
     up as Maudy slowly approaches Lestat and nuzzles his
     neck.

     He shivers with temptation. Her hand moves down the
     front of his pants. Lestat pulls her into his arms.
     Leaning into her neck he breathes in her scent, closes
     his eyes and... Suddenly opens them right at Roger who
     looks on, extremely perturbed. Smiling like the devil...

<b>                          LESTAT

     pulls out the crucifix around his neck.

</b>                  I didn't know you were religious.

     Roger tries to laugh it off. Lestat sniffs the air. As
     Roger backs away, he turns to open the door, stumbles,
     cutting his hand on a fallen shard of glass. Blood
     trickles from the cut. Roger looks up at Lestat whose
     dark eyes stare intensely at Roger's blood. Roger
     quickly sticks his hand in his mouth. With a horrified
     expression, he realizes he's sucking his blood. He
     quickly heads out. But Lestat is faster and reaches
     into Roger's shirt pocket. Pulls out a clove of garlic.     Lestat
     shakes his head with a smile.

     He goes to the paintings hanging on a wall in the back of
     his office, covered with black velvet. Jesse follows.
     He unveils them.

     They stand before an Eighteenth-Century painting. The
     interior of an enormous Italian villa. There's a man in
     his forties with long white hair, back to us, but his
     face is reflected in a standing mirror.

</b>                  Right. And what do you see in

     giant medieval tableaux, circa Bruegel.

<b>                          TALBOT
</b>                  And I know it's a Dutch pastoral.

     Jesse runs her finger across the faces, then stops on the
     face of a gentleman with long white hair watching the
     bloodshed of gory battles and the sacrifices of saints
     burned at the stake.

     next, all nightscapes set and painted in the style of
     different eras, all featuring a portrait of the same
     white-maned man.

     As Jesse goes out, holding the journal, Talbot smiles
     after her.

     But after the door closes, his gaze turns again to
     concern. He crosses back to the paintings, pauses a
     moment, staring up into Marius's eyes. Then Talbot
     covers each with the black velvet.

     A great round room encircled with candles, their
     reflections flickering in the great glass windows braving
     back the outside STORM. A huge antique bed sits in the
     room's center, and on it... Lestat lays feverish and
     fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. His neck
     wears a swollen bite. Another flash of lightning
     suddenly jolts him awake. His hands feel the inflamed
     wound as he sees...

     An indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red
     velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. An
     easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting.
     Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a
     nearby Louis IV chair. He makes for a door when...

     Lestat suddenly stops. He looks back to see the painting
     that stands on the easel. It's a portrait of himself in
     ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his
     blond hair and fiery blue eyes. Unable to help himself,
     he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his
     own image, when suddenly...

     The sleeping man leaps up, grabs   Lestat unmercifully and
     again plunges his teeth into the   young man's neck.
     Lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match
     as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor. Finally...

     The strange man lifts himself up from Lestat's neck to
     reveal the face of the vampire MARIUS, the mysterious
     figure. Wiping his blooded mouth on his painter's
     cloth --

<b>                            MARIUS

     Weakened and helpless, Lestat drags himself back across
     the floor in terror.

     Marius advances again on the young man...

<b>                          MARIUS

                  way from home...

     His strength leaving him, Lestat slumps flat on the
     floor.

<b>                          MARIUS
</b>                  You're weak... near passing. I

     Marius smiles, impressed.

<b>                          MARIUS
</b>                  You really do fear nothing. It is
                  why I chose you. Because you
                  think things are possible which
                  aren't possible...

     Lestat stares at him, his eyes wide.

     Suddenly Marius draws a knife from a Roman sheath on his
     belt. With the last of his strength, Lestat grabs his
     attacker's wrist.

     Guiding Lestat's hand with the knife, Marius smiles and
     cuts his own arm, opening his veins. Lestat stares in
     true terror as Marius lets his blood drip onto Lestat's
     lip. Lestat pulls away as the blood slides into his
     mouth...

     And indeed... it does taste good. That's the new terror

     into Marius's gentle eyes. Marius bends down, cups
     Lestat's chin.

     Marius brings his open vein to Lestat's lips. Lestat
     hesitates, but then suddenly... Feeds hungrily as
     Marius's face fills with the bond. He slowly sinks
     down to his knees as Lestat feeds and feeds. As

     begins to weaken, himself.

     But Lestat keeps on feeding hungrily.

<b>                          MARIUS
</b>                  No... no more.   Lestat, no more!

     With one great move, Marius pulls Lestat off his arm and
     tosses him across the floor twenty feet away. Marius
     reels back, clamping his open vein with his hand as
     Lestat curls on the ground, gasping ecstatically from the
     rush.

     Slowly, Lestat starts to feel something. Pain begins
     travelling through his body, consuming him until he
     screams. Marius crosses to Lestat convulsing on the
     floor. He kneels and gently wipes his brow. Lestat's
     body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs...

<b>                          MARIUS
</b>                  Don't be afraid, it's only your
                  body that dies...

     Wiping his brow as he dies...

     Then, Lestat's face still buried in his arms, he begins
     to laugh almost drunkenly. Raising his head, his
     metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes
     fill with a new kind of power.

<b>                          LESTAT
</b>                  More!

     Lestat smiles with red glistening lips.     A beat on Marius
     as he slowly smiles, too.

                  educate me in the unknown. Taught
                  me all about the world, its hidden
                  history... and about myself.

     TILT DOWN to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as
     Lestat bites into his throat. Marius watches as the
     fisherman's body relaxes. He pulls Lestat away.

                  take the last drop, or it will
                  draw you in and you will die...

     The fisherman is moaning. Looking down at the suffering
     victim, Marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into
     a boat. He picks up an oar, and with vampire strength,
     drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat.
     Water starts bubbling in.

     Marius feels Lestat's gaze, turns to him.

<b>                          MARIUS
</b>                  I'm talking about humanity.

     As Lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom
     of the boat...

                  knowledge, their complexity.
                  Appreciate your prey, Lestat.

     Marius gazes at the fisherman, then, with vampire
     strength, shoves the boat far out into the ocean.

     Below the brightest of summer night skies, Lestat and
     Marius walk along, talking intensely. The ocean appears
     to shimmer in the faint light of stars. In the distance,
     several bonfires burn on the sand, dancing figures
     gathered around.

                  the unfolding of human destiny...

     Lestat gazes at Marius's eyes dancing with intellectual
     fervor. As they walk, they pass a group of teenagers,
     just younger than Lestat, at a bonfire, dancing, laughing.

     Lestat gazes over at them as he and Marius pass, hidden
     in shadow.

<b>                          MARIUS

                  can't wait to see what human
                  beings are going to do next...

     Lestat nods, taking it in. They pass another bonfire.
     MUSIC floats through the night. An OLDER MAN, 50, plays
     balalaika while his daughter, 18, plays violin with great
     passion.

     Marius stops talking, turns. Lestat is no longer beside
     him. Marius turns back and sees Lestat standing in the
     shadows, listening to the music. The young woman, sensing
     something, turns towards Lestat in the shadows as she
     plays. Marius goes to Lestat, pulls him farther into the
     shadows.

                  creatures.

     Lestat's eyes fill with some existential realization.

     Relenting, Lestat starts to follow. But the music
     quickens. Lestat pauses, turns back. As if the music is
     calling to him.

     The girl still faces into the shadows towards him, and
     plays fast and wild, her fingers flying. Lestat stands
     there frozen to the spot. The music pulses through
     him. He gazes at her fingers, studying their intricate
     movements intensely...

     Impulsively, Lestat goes back to them, hovers, his face
     still somewhat obscured by the darkness. Lestat starts
     clapping along to the music, exuberantly.

     The girl and Father smile, nod to him as they play.
     Marius, in the shadows, is fuming. Lestat's eyes fill
     with the moment, the girl's vitality. He notices that
     sitting on the ground by the girl are several
     instruments. Impulsively, he reaches over, picks up a
     violin. He studies the girl's playing again, then with
     his new powers, as if by osmosis...

     Begins to play with exactly her skill, exactly her
     movements.

     The girl and her Father laugh, delighted with this new
     musician. Lestat plays along with them, joyful,
     exhilarated. The girl's fingers fly. Lestat's fingers
     pick up speed. Faster. Faster. A glittering torrent of
     notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold.

     Unconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into
     firelight. The Father and his daughter become less
     certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing
     skin, the luminous shine of eyes. But Lestat is
     completely taken by the music, the moment. The Father
     and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop
     playing. Lestat looks up. Sees terror in their eyes.
     The Father is slowly backing away, pointing in
     horror at Lestat.

<b>                          FATHER

     Lightning fast, out of the shadows, steps Marius. He
     grabs the Father. The girl drops her violin, turns, starts
     running down the beach to a bonfire in the distance.

<b>                          MARIUS

     Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head no in horror.

<b>                          MARIUS
</b>                  You must!

     Lestat hesitates, then runs after the girl. She turns
     back, sees him getting closer, starts to scream...
     Lestat is suddenly in front of her with his hand over her
     mouth, covering her muffled scream.   Her struggle is no
     use against his strength. Reaching up to her neck, he
     touches it. He looks into her terrified eyes...

     Marius kneels over the body of the Father on the island's
     deserted shoreline. Tosses him in a boat. Lestat gazes
     at the lifeless body of the girl. Marius turns to
     Lestat, furious.

     get a better look... Suddenly, out of the shadows, a
     BOTTLE SMASHES... She starts, quickens her pace...

     Runs straight into a bulky figure. A primal scream rises
     from her stomach. The figure is a homeless drunk, more
     scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the
     night. Jesse presses her back against the wall.
     Breathes. She inches around the corner...

     The music is part blues, part Kurt Weil, part Gothic,
     dark and ominous as if the pianist knew exactly the sort
     of trouble Jesse was in. The bar is comprised of
     elaborately-carved Chinese dragons, a TV mounted
     incongruously in the corner showing a silent Vampire
     Lestat video.

     Couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a
     music box. Another couple is necking hot and heavy in
     the corner. Jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire
     coven. Many of the faces are unnaturally pale, gaunt.
     Their eyes shine with a strange, reflective light. Jesse
     moves through the tables, passing a mortal YUPPIE-TYPE

     The Vampire Girl smiles, glances up at Jesse as she
     passes. Jesse looks away quickly, moves on... The
     pianist watches as she passes by. The couple necking in
     the corner begins to get even more aroused. A mortal
     girl sips on her drink while her lover, a vampire, kisses
     her shoulder, her throat...

     Unaware that she is being watched, Jesse continues her
     circuit.

     A young girl dressed in Goth gear sits down at the bar.
     Punk Vampire #1 turns and smiles insincerely at her as
     she stares up at Lestat on the TV. Getting a sudden

     the crowd as the vampire looks after her with murderous
     eyes.

                  to get through eternity? It's
                  easier for us mortals. Life is
                  brief, but for you...

     She inches toward the door, desperately stalling. Their
     white faces gleam menacingly as they close in. She
     struggles to get the words out...

<b>                          JESSE

                  from one day to the next, trapped
                  in a void of meaninglessness,
                  relieved only by your next victim?
                  How do you not give in to despair
                  and just wither away from boredom,
                  hopelessness?

     The Punk Vampires pause, staring at her, as her words
     sink in. The hooded figure leans forward revealing his
     face...

     It is Lestat. He stares at Jesse, amazed. Jesse glances
     desperately at the door. It's just a few feet away now.

     All around her, vampires are turning to look. The Punk
     Vampires stare at her, eyes narrowing. Jesse is now
     inches from the door. She can barely breathe. Punk
     Vampire #1 gazes at her, his confusion suddenly turning
     to anger.

     ACROSS vampire faces staring after Jesse TO Lestat
     who gazes at her, absolutely entranced. He watches the
     Punk Vampires head after Jesse.

     Jesse hurries up the alley. Breaks into a run. But the
     three Punk Vampires from the bar have somehow gotten
     outside. They land in front of her, beside her, behind
     her. Heart racing, she shakes with fear. They close in,
     smiling.

     He runs his hand up and down her body. Jesse starts to
     shake. She breaks out in a cold sweat. The others grin.
     He picks her up by the throat. Her legs flail in the
     air...

     Suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats. Jesse
     hits the flagstones hard with a grunt. She gasps for
     air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley
     by an invisible force. Jesse alone, turns, still woozy.
     Finds herself staring at...

     Lestat...

     Jesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned.

     He drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness
     of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks,
     her pulsing jugular.

     Jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to
     gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated.
     They gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric.

     Jesse notices her rucksack cast aside by the Punk
     Vampires -- Lestat's journal sticks out. She glances at
     Lestat. He mustn't see it. She steps away, tries to
     distract him.

     blurts out.

     there's something there that surprises him as he gazes
     at this mortal girl. He feels something. Desire...

     Then her blood speaks to him as Lestat's eyes fall on her
     rucksack. He sees the journal. It all falls into place.

     Lestat's lip curls in anger. He shoves Jesse away.
     Wipes his mouth. The mood suddenly changes.

<b>                                LESTAT
</b>                  Well, Talamascan, you're certainly
                  a very clever librarian, aren't
                  you?

     She stares at him, found out. He turns from her,
     laughing, but not the kind of laugh to make Jesse
     think all's well.

                  How sad, you people always trying
                  to know the unknowable... So, was
                  it a good read? My diary.

     Jesse slowly nods, admitting to all.    He shakes his head.

<b>                                LESTAT
</b>                  Talamasca's been following me for
                  years. I've never known one to be
                  so brave. Or is it just foolish?

<b>                                JESSE

</b>                  Go. I'm through with you. Your
                  kind never satisfies my thirst.

     He turns, walks away. Jesse lets out a sigh of relief,
     then stares after him. She hesitates, then suddenly
     calls out:

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                  Does anything, Lestat?

     A pause in his gait. But he keeps walking away.       Jesse
     hesitates again, but still calls out.

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                  I mean, what's the point of coming
                  into the light if not to have
                  someone really know you?

     But he keeps going.    She takes one last chance --

<b>                                JESSE
</b>                  You want the world to see you're

                  you? Well, here I am!

     Suddenly Lestat spins. Stares at the fragile mortal girl
     risking everything. Flash. Jesse gasps.

     He now stands right before her. He grabs her, pulls her
     to him close, tight, hard. He could just snap her neck
     and be done with it.

                  have it all wrong. I love all
                  this. I delight in it. The
                  dark, dreary world I went to

                  been replaced by the 20th Century
                  -- can you imagine my joy at
                  waking up to discover such a
                  world? It has outdistanced my
                  wildest dreams of it. I scream of
                  good and evil, and mortals stand
                  and cheer. I adore being back in
                  action... every moment, every
                  single drop of it! Now consider
                  yourself exceedingly lucky and go!

     He pushes her away.       She gasps, humbled by his physical
     power.

     She retrieves her rucksack. Starts away. As she
     reaches the end of the alley, she pauses, takes a breath,
     turns back, daring everything.

     A beat, then Lestat shakes his head, laughs at the
     absurdity of what she's saying. But Jesse is undaunted.

<b>                                JESSE

     That stops him. Their eyes bore into each other again.
     Electric. Then Lestat hisses at her, the inhuman sound
     filling the alley. Lestat lunges, fangs bared. Jesse
     screams. Turns. Runs. Finds herself --

     In the midst of traffic on a busy street.     People walking

</b>                  Jesus Christ.

     She stands there a moment, happy, amazed to be alive.
     Then it sinks in. She realizes -- Lestat let her go.

     She glances back at the alley, but Lestat is gone.

     She brings her finger to her mouth, slowly sticks it in,
     tastes her own blood, shivers with fear -- and something
     else -- desire.

     What she doesn't see is...

     Lestat in the shadows, silently watching her. He gazes
     at her youth, her bright eyes, her daring, her mortal
     passion. She has affected him.

     He watches as she turns and runs away.

<b>76   INT. LESTAT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                76

     Lestat enters the bedroom. Behind him, Lestat's dressing
     room stretches off into the distance, rows of beautiful
     suits made from the finest wools and silks. The
     gradation of colors is spectacular. Peering out at the
     near-dawn light, a look of loneliness clouds his face.

     He crosses to the closet. Opens a panel to reveal a
     safe. Stares at it a moment. Punches in the code. It
     swings open to reveal something wrapped carefully in
     black velvet. Lestat unwraps it delicately. It's the
     ancient violin.

</b>                     (softly)

     He quickly puts the violin back, closes the safe door.
     He shakes his head, tries to laugh it off. But a shadow
     remains on his face. Lestat hears a gasp. Turns. Roger
     has just entered.

     around the first groupie's hair when a shadow crosses
     his face.

     onto a couch. With a clap of his hands, the TV switches
     ON. He silently watches one of his video clips.

     The girls glance at each other, then, giggling, crawl
     over toward Lestat. Groupie #1 slides her hand slowly

     and slides off the couch onto the floor with grace.

     All fours as well as he leads them around the room in a

     Lestat crawling just   ahead of them across the floor

     Lestat reaches the wall's top and now crawls upside-down
     across the ceiling. The girls begin to giggle and half-cry...
     as they arch their necks all the way back to see...
     Lestat crawling down the opposite wall. The girls sit
     open-mouthed with terror as Lestat reaches the ground --

     He heads straight for them.

     in his inner sanctum. He looks at all the paintings.
     His neat, protected world. It's as if Marius is taunting

     Jesse puts on headphones, listens to LESTAT'S MUSIC.   As
     she opens the journal, LESTAT'S MUSIC DISSOLVES INTO
<b>     VIOLIN...
</b>

<b>83   FLASHBACK - INT. VILLA - BEDROOM - LESTAT                      83
</b>
     Lestat standing alone in the bedroom in a deep reverie,
     playing the violin, with incredible passion.

     His playing picks up speed, the bow bending across the
     strings with a maestro's speed and precision.

<b>                             LESTAT (V.O.)
</b>               Yes, Marius was impressed with my
               thirst for knowledge... But it

               turned out that there was such a
               thing as knowing too much. There
               were things Marius was not yet
               ready to teach me... and Marius
               and I parted ways.

     Suddenly, the bow flies out of his hand and slides across
     the floor, jamming itself under an old bookcase. Lestat
     comes out of his spell, walks across the room to the
     bookcase, bends down to cleave the bow out from under it.
     Having difficulty, he pushes back an old rug on the floor
     when he sees something...

     Carved into one of the floorboards is an Egyptian eye
     with a hole dug out of its iris. Stepping aside, he
     realizes he is standing on a manhole. A beat ON Lestat
     as he thinks... Poking his finger through the hole of the
     Egyptian eye, he lifts the manhole to reveal a steep set
     of steps leading down into the villa's basement.

<b>                          LESTAT
</b>               Marius!

     No answer. Lestat looks around wondering what to do.
     Taking a candelabra off the table, he ventures down the
     stairs, peering down into the darkness.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             60.
</b>
<b>84   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - SECRET STAIRCASE - NIGHT                84
</b>
     Lestat negotiates a circling flight of stone steps,
     winding its way into the lowest bowels of the villa,
     still carrying his violin.


<b>85   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY                  85
</b>
     Lestat finds himself facing a steeply descending
     passageway that stretches into darkness. He tests the
     stones ahead of him with caution...

     Suddenly, the sconces along the passageway come to
     life... In quick succession, they flare up and burn with
     an unnatural intensity. Lestat, struck with curiosity
     and wonder, puts down his candelabra and ventures forth.
     We FOLLOW Lestat as he rounds the corner and stops.
     There is an open foyer area leading to two great wooden
     doors, held firm by a tree-sized carved wooden bolt that
     bars the doors shut from the outside.

     Suddenly, the BOLT flies up and SPLINTERS with a
     SHRIEKING CRACK. The doors fly open revealing a bright
     light from within... Lestat, apprehensive, continues
     towards the open doorway.


<b>86   INT. SANCTUARY - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            86
</b>
     Lestat enters, squinting through the bright light from
     scores of burning sconces. At the far end of the
     sanctuary Lestat makes out the shape of two statues,
     an Egyptian man and an Egyptian woman sitting stone
     still, seemingly staring straight at him, AKASHA and
     her King, ENKIL. We recognize Akasha from the sketches
     in Talbot's office. Stepping closer, they appear not to
     be statues at all but rather alabaster humans with the
     palest skin imaginable. His eyes widen at the sight of
     their clothes -- the most valuable Egyptian finery;
     bracelets of gold, headdresses of incredible gems,
     clothes of silk. Staring up into their faces, Lestat
     is struck with the realization...

<b>                       LESTAT
</b>               They're... alive.

     Lestat is drawn to the woman -- her form and beauty is
     exquisite even in its absolute stillness. As if this
     statue had just asked him to play, Lestat holds out his
     violin.

<b>                       LESTAT
</b>               Would you like me to play for you?

     Her eyes still bore into him. Lestat smiles.   He raises
     his violin and begins to play.

     The song of the VIOLIN ECHOES around the walls...

     Lestat plays, with increasing abandon...

     Akasha and Enkil sit frozen...

     Lestat plays and plays, lost in the music.   He throws a
     glance up at the throne and stops...

     Akasha is moving...

     Slowly, her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes.

     Lestat stares in amazement... Her arm rises up, her wrist
      extended outward towards Lestat. The pulse of a
     HEARTBEAT begins... Lestat moves toward her as if
     beckoned. A green vein appears beneath the marble
     surface of her skin. The vein pulses as the blood
     courses around. The HEARTBEAT POUNDS LOUDER, DEEPER.

     The sound fills Lestat's head as he is drawn closer to
     Akasha's wrist. Lowering himself, as if genuflecting,
     Lestat bends closer to the vein which looks like the very
     font of life to him...

     Marius sits under the stars, painting, when his hand
     begins to tremble... Suddenly, he drops his brush,
     startled by some unexpected feeling that passes through
     him. He stands bolt upright as a frightening GUST of
     WIND sweeps across him.

     unimaginable font. A burst of image and color floods
     into him, as...

     in the sanctuary, hovering over Lestat, who lays on the
     stone floor in a catatonic state, staring. Marius looks
     down upon him, the sconces above blazing high with
     flames. Marius's VOICE ECHOING furiously...

     At the foot of the bed stands Marius.

               Lestat?

     The young vampire's eyes bulge open in the grip of some
     incredible sensation, smiling the most wicked of smiles.
     Lestat's chest heaves upward, pulling his body with it,
     only to be jerked back by the manacles that hold him to
     the bed.

<b>                       LESTAT

<b>                       MARIUS
</b>               I don't think so, my little lord.

     Lestat writhes with a physical delight that is almost
     painful. Lestat realizes he is shackled to the bed with
     manacles and chains. Struggles against them.

<b>                       LESTAT

                   known Akasha dormant. She too
                   will find you. She is choosing
                   her moment. She has come to
                   destroy you, Lestat. And in her
                   wrath, she will devour everything
                   that moves. Mortal and vampire
                   alike.

                   Well then, it's every vampire for
                   himself. Just the kind of rules I
                   like. The rules you taught me.

      Marius is enraged, tries to control himself.      Lestat
      gazes at him, speaks steadily.

                   I'd rather not exist at all than
                   have to live eternally as a ghost.

<b>                           MARIUS

      The barman looks up at the sound of the DOOR SLAMMING.
      He does a double-take and watches in awe as... Akasha
      steps in. Everyone in the bar turns. She smiles at
      all the undead staring at her.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                Hello...

      Her eyes sweep the room, taking in every inch, searching,
      then she hears a Vampire Lestat VIDEO PLAYING. She
      whirls around quickly to the TV -- gazes at the video
      intensely. Her eyes narrow, focus on Lestat, speaks as
      if to herself.

      She turns to Vampire Lover, takes him in.

      As if with a new idea, smiles at him, moves to the
      dance floor, moving to LESTAT'S MUSIC, her eyes closed,
      swaying sensually, her hips gyrating. The dance is
      seductive, slow, her head thrown back. The vampires
      turn, stare at her, mesmerized, aroused by her
      movements. They move to the dance floor, watching.
      Akasha opens her eyes, smiles at them, then turns to
      Vampire Lover, points to him, beckons. He smiles back,
      happy to be chosen, moves onto the dance floor. She
      dances a little farther away. A game. He laughs.
      Moves closer.


<b>      CLOSE ON VAMPIRE LOVER
</b>
      He hears a LAUGH.


<b>      BACK TO AKASHA
</b>
      But she's disappeared. He turns. Akasha's behind him
      now. He stares at her. Her hips are gyrating, her
      body slithering. A moan escapes from him. Again, he
      moves to her, reaches for her. She laughs.


<b>      CLOSE ON HIS PUZZLED FACE
</b>
      He turns...

      She's dancing across the floor now. Vampire Lover's
      smile is not so friendly now. He steps toward her,
      determined... She moves behind him. Her body pressed up
      tight against his. He smiles, shudders with a rush of
      desire. All the other vampires watch, envious. Her
      lips brush his neck, her hands run up and down his
      body pausing on his chest. He reaches for her. She
      kisses him just as he kissed the mortal girl. On Vampire
      Lover's face, pure pleasure...

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                   Then again, you could always do
                   this...

      Akasha sinks her fangs into his neck and at the same
      time, plunges her hand down. We can't see where... We
      STAY ON Vampire Lover's face as Akasha disappears FROM
      FRAME. The sound of BONE SNAPPING, the SQUISH of RIPPING FLESH.
       LOUD SUCKING. A look of horror appears on
      Vampire Lover's face. Akasha REAPPEARS. In her hand,
      she now holds...

      ... his dripping heart.    She brings it to her lips, sucks
      again thirstily...

      Vampire Lover gurgles as she sucks the heart to a dry
      husk, then tosses it. She turns back to Vampire Lover,
      his face frozen in a grotesque mask. She laughs, drops
      him unceremoniously to the floor...

      Akasha turns to face the rest of the horrified vampires.
      They begin to back away. But the DOOR LOCKS itself
<b>      LOUDLY.
</b>
      Akasha sways again to the music, moving faster now, as if
      refreshed.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                   Turn up the music!

      The terrified barman quickly COMPLIES.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                      (smiles, to herself)
                   Oh, I do love the 21st Century.

      Akasha turns to the terrified barman again, pulls him
      over the bar and attacks him as if she were just reaching
      for a snack. He flails but is overwhelmed by her
      strength...

      The Vampire Girl who Jesse saw vanish with the Yuppie,
      flies towards Akasha, knife raised, but Akasha just
      turns... Suddenly there is an EXPLOSION of FLAMES. The
      Vampire Girl screams as she is consumed. The piano
      player and guitar player go up in flames...

      All hell breaks loose as the other vampires run for the
      door. The lock won't budge and it's too late anyway as
      the flames overwhelm them...

      And THROUGH the flames, we see Akasha smiling, now
      sucking on the Punk Vampire's aorta like it's a straw.
      She tosses his body, her long tongue slowly licks her
      bloody, thirsty lips. She strides out through the flames.
      In a whispery, sing-song voice.

      Marius stands in the hills by the Hollywood sign, gazing
      down, his brow furrowed, at Lestat's fortress-like
      mansion hidden in the canyon below. The WIND BLOWS the
      trees, bushes. Marius turns, uneasy, sensing something,
      peers into the shadows cast by the brightly-lit sign.
      Marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows.

      It is Mael, a vampire, his face hidden in a cloak.

<b>                        MAEL
</b>                Marius, you've broken your oath.
                You were to watch over Akasha
                and Khayman. You are a great
                disappointment to me.

      Marius looks up to see all the Ancients now stepping
      from the shadows. KHAYMAN, the desert vampire, in
      Egyptian dress along with PANDORA, the dark-haired
      beauty in her sari, ARMAND, the boy sage, in his
      Mesopotamian robes. Last, MAHARET steps from her
      grand door. She is beautiful with long red hair,
      alabaster skin.

<b>                        MARIUS
</b>                Pandora, Armand, it's been a long
                time. Khayman, Maharet, to what do
                I owe this honor?

<b>                        KHAYMAN
</b>                You have been summoned because of
                your errant child...

      Khayman crosses to the edge, peers menacingly into the
      distance at Lestat's house.

      glance. Turns to Marius with a look of warning.

      each other. Maharet gazes at their faces, spits out

      cruising the Hollywood streets, wearing sunglasses,
      hat. He sees something.

      A Goth girl on the street in front of a record store.


<b>      BACK TO ROGER
</b>
      He sighs, pulls over.    Gets out.


<b>      EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</b>
      Behind him now we see a cab pull over. It's Jesse,
      trailing Roger. She gazes at him intently.


<b>      JESSE'S POV
</b>
      Roger's back is TO us as he talks to a Goth girl in a
      whisper.

      Jesse pays the driver.    Gets out.   Gazes at Roger.


<b>127   INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - SOUND STUDIO - NIGHT      127
</b>
      LOUD, intense MUSIC as the band rehearses. Lestat
      creates a fantastic melody around the beat. He lets
      the note trail off, eyes closed, smiling, the
      REVERB still RINGING in the room. Lestat hears
      something, turns. Outside, in the Hollywood Hills,
      DOGS are HOWLING across the canyons like wolves.
      Lestat crosses to the huge glass doors, goes outside...

      Lestat stares out at the ominous night. As Maudy and the
      band continue to play, the wolflike HOWLS in the night
      get LOUDER. And beneath it all, a DEEP PULSE BEATS. The
      song comes to an end. Lestat turns, gazes back at the
      band THROUGH the window, at their excitement. He comes
      back inside.


<b>129   INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               129

</b>                The... girls you asked for, Lestat.
                They're here, in the guest wing.

      Lestat gazes in that direction, pensive.

</b>                I was uh... just gonna go catch a
                movie at the Chinese. I don't

</b>                No, thank you, Roger.   We'll

      As Roger leads Lestat to the guest room, he can hear
      FAINT GIGGLING. Lestat turns back to the night. The
      PULSE of Akasha still ECHOES in his ears.

      She turns in paroxysm of excitement to the girl next to
      her. Lestat stares, taken aback. It is Jesse. Dressed
      in Goth gear. Jesse stares back at Lestat brazenly. A
      long moment.

      Her heart pounding, fluttering her eyes closed, Jesse
      holds one deep, hesitant breath and... Flash -- with
      preternatural speed --

      whisk through the night, flashing past trees and
      houses. Opening her eyes for a moment, Jesse watches
      the world whiz past her at incredible speed and
      suddenly -- they stop on a dime.

      Jesse gasps, catching her breath to find herself at
      Hollywood's highest peak overlooking the city laying
      out before her like a glimmering blanket.

</b>
      Looking out over the observatory's ledge, Jesse can't
      believe what's just happened. She laughs, intoxicated by
      the experience.

<b>                        JESSE
</b>                Do that again!

      Lestat laughs, impressed by her bravado. Her trust. For
      a moment she laughs like a child. Then they look at each
      other deeply, feeling something. He wants to kiss her.
      She knows it. He turns away.

<b>                              LESTAT
</b>                And now for my next trick.

      Lestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open.

      Jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something
      stirring in her. Magically, the wound heals up. She
      stares, impressed.

<b>                                 JESSE
</b>                Did it hurt?

<b>                        LESTAT
</b>                Yes. For just a moment. But as
                the pain is more intense for us,
                so is ecstacy.
                   (gazes at her)
                You see, we love our victims.

<b>                          JESSE
</b>                Love?    I thought it was the blood.

<b>                              LESTAT
</b>                No, although the taste is so rich
                and sweet. Love is the essence of
                the dark gift. The connection is
                so much more satisfying, brief as
                it is, than anything else.

      Lestat again becomes aware of Jesse's pulsing jugular,
      the white flesh of her neck. He reaches out, touches her
      neck, strokes it. Jesse shivers under his touch,
      terrified, but wanting more. Lestat brushes his lips
      against her hair, her neck. Runs his hands down her
      arms. She closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm
      of his voice.

<b>                           LESTAT
</b>                   As you drink, you feel the heart
                   weakening... it struggles even
                   though there's no hope. You feel
                   the life slipping away, the flash
                   of those brief years. The taste
                   of mortality you can no longer
                   experience... and it is
                   beautiful...
                      (pulls away sharply)
                   No 'relationship,' no commingling
                   can ever reach the heights of that
                   experience.

      But Jesse steps forward.       Lestat turns, stares at her.

      Her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced.
      One button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens
      her blouse down to her navel.

      Lestat stares as Jesse removes a long, silver hairpin
      from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about
      her shoulders. Her face remains aimed unwavering at
      Lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast.

      With her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the
      point across her breast. She inhales through clenched
      teeth... then settles as we see:

      The long incision go from pink to red; then the blood,
      like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping
      down her chest.

      Lestat staggers. Breaking their stare, he accepts her
      gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound
      itself. Lestat closes her eyes... He comes up to her
      face, brushing his lips against her cheek. She
      shivers...

      pulsing skin. He bares his fangs.

      But suddenly her words catch him... His head flails as he
      tries to stop his natural impulse. Lestat lets out a
      desperate cry and throws her aside. Jesse gazes at him,
      surprised. He looms over her, angry.

      Lestat and Jesse quietly move among the trees. Lestat
      stops on a dime -- senses tuned. He looks into the dark.
      Jesse is about to speak when Lestat raises his finger to
      her lips and then points at... A couple of lovers moving
      across the meadow. They sit on a park bench. The woman
      giggles drunkenly. Jesse watches and gasps as she
      realizes the male lover is a vampire. Lestat moves
      forward. Jesse gingerly follows.

      Taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite
      her neck... Lestat looks over at Jesse who watches,
      fascinated and disturbed. The vampire senses another's
      presence -- stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes
      shining in the dark. Lestat steps into the halo of a
      street lamp and hisses. Sensing Lestat's power, the
      vampire hisses and instantly -- the vampire is gone.
      Jesse turns to Lestat but he has disappeared, too.
      Spinning around again she sees... Lestat hovering over
      the mortal woman who is still in a swoon. Checking to
      see that the vampire is gone, Jesse moves closer to the
      bench.

      Lestat looks up to face her, revealing his blood-stained
      lips. Jesse reflexively looks away.

<b>                           LESTAT

</b>                   Lestat, no!

      Lestat's expression turns cold as ice -- he arches his
      back like a great cat and goes in for the kill. The
      woman's body convulses... Jesse watches in horror as...
      the woman's hands clutch at Lestat, her back stiffens...
      finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm.
      Jesse gasps, backs away. Lestat finishes and, wiping his
      mouth, approaches Jesse.

<b>                           LESTAT

                   do you want it?!

      He gazes into her eyes, finding himself desperately
      wanting her to say yes. The horror, the revulsion in
      Jesse's face says it all.

<b>                            LESTAT
</b>                   No.   Of course you don't.

      She backs away from him, now terrified. Something's
      changed in his eyes. They are cold, blank.

<b>                           LESTAT
</b>                   Well I didn't grant your final

                   It was an impossible wish to begin
                   with. You see, I am unknowable.

      His eyes still as death, he starts moving away.

      pulls her into his arms, gazes into her eyes.

      Jesse closes her eyes in terror, knowing her life is
      about to be over.

      Then Jesse reaches for her mouth as if she were touched
      by something when... the IMAGE of Lestat's lips kissing
      her lips flashes by in VAMPIRE TIME as... Jesse's face is
      completely still in HUMAN TIME. As her hand drops, she
      realizes what just happened. And with that, Lestat
      disappears. She stares into the night. There's a SWISH
      and the sound of RUSHING AIR. Jesse turns, screams,
      backs away. It's not Lestat standing there at all but
      Mael, the Druid vampire. With great speed he glides
      towards her, envelops Jesse in his cloak, muffling her
      cries... WHOOSH.

      Her finger trails down the great line to a name --
      "Jessica Reeves"...

</b>                   When your parents died I took you

      Jesse sits on a stone bench, confused.       Maharet smiles
      sadly, feeling Jesse's inner turmoil.

      Just then the gloom of the pre-dawn's light begins to
      illuminate the windows of the great hall.

</b>                   You will go home to London in the

      Maharet touches her face gently.

</b>                   Now is not the time to be here...

      Maharet goes to Jesse, wraps her arms tight around Jesse.
      Despite the coldness of her skin, Jesse warms to the
      embrace, closes her eyes, holds her tight. Then, beaten
      by the sun, Maharet stands, exits into the shadows, turns
      back to Jesse, gazes at her.

      Lestat stands by his bed, playing the ancient violin... a
      long mournful note. He stops a moment, lost in his
      thoughts. A flash of the first morning light reflects
      off the ancient wood. Lestat puts the violin away. A
      tear of blood trickles down his cheek. His face is
      filled with sadness at what will never be. A word
      escapes from his lips.

      Jesse moves down the hallway past paintings of vampires.
      She pauses at one of Maharet. As Jesse shifts, the glass
      over the painting catches Jesse's reflection. Jesse
      moves slowly until her face just covers Maharet's. In
      the reflection, Jesse's eyes now glow with Maharet's
      luminescence. Jesse stares a long, long moment.

      Maharet's sprawling compound sits alone in the empty
      desert. Nothing for as far as the eye can see.

      Jesse walks away from the house. Coming to a highway,
      she reads a sign -- "DEATH VALLEY 120 miles." Just then,
      a VW minibus barrels down the road in Jesse's direction.
      She sticks out her thumb... The minibus pulls to a stop
      on the shoulder in a cloud of dust. A VAMPIRE DRIVER
      leans out the window -- not a real vampire, just a kid
      with white face-paint and fake fangs.

      toward a strange red glow rising into the dark night sky.
      A distant sound of DRUMS BEATING chaotic rhythms is
      heard. As we FLY CLOSER, the DRUMMING becomes LOUDER and

      A mass of people (30,000) gather in a valley of red rock.

      it's too late. Flash. Marius is moving through the

      high into the sky, run like a corridor of red light
      along the crowd, leading to two enormous Egyptian
      effigies of Akasha and Enkil flanking a stage at the
      top end. And before the stage stretches a mass of
      human bacchanalian debauchery... Woodstock on mescaline.
      Naked bodies, pierced and tattooed, mingle with the
      strangest of fashions as crowds gather in circles
      around their own lit fires, drumming out awesome rhythms.

      The whole place is an enormous flaming mosh pit   -- naked
      bodies walk across heads of people while others   get
      tossed and thrown. This crowd is determined to    get

      The place erupts into one solid scream as the band kicks
      it in.

      He swoops down through the air over the stage and into
      their very midst. Jesse, in the crowd, screams up to
      him... But her voice is lost in the thousands of screams
      for him. Lestat takes the microphone and leans his lips
      into it, letting his voice soar into an inhuman note,
      filling the valley like a demon demanding heaven be
      replaced with hell.

      The pulsing strain moves into a faster beat as the whole
      place resonates with the most incredible harmonics, the
      energy throbbing, the crowd almost genuflecting in front

      Lestat, who commands the place with his echoing voice.
      Lestat holds the place in the palm of his hand. Lestat's

      an even higher unworldly octave, and then...

      them. Lestat launches the band into a new number that
      makes the previous song seem like a lullaby. He eyes the
      coven-assassins here and there and sings straight to
      them. His lyrics challenging the assassins, flaunting
      them with satire. Jesse whirls around, spying the
      assassins in the crowd. She shakes her head no...
      The covens need no more encouragement as they begin to

      Akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a
      kind of purr/growl. Lestat gazes at her as the sensual
      hissing seems to surround him. It is seductive and
      scary. Lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips.

      into the air and off into the night.

      Mael leads Jesse down the hall. She stares ahead at what
      looks like statues standing in the shadows. Her eyes
      widen as the statues come to life: Armand, Pandora,
      Khayman, Marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered
      before Maharet's "Great Family Tree." CAMERA SWEEPS
      OVER the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch
      down the stone wall -- ACROSS the floor, filling room
      after room. The Ancients all stare, deeply moved.
      Maharet turns to them.

                       great family)

      Lestat and Akasha stand on a cliff-top. WIND rips
      through the trees. Everywhere, there are torches, and a
      million candles light the vast house. Lestat and Akasha
      glide past the forest of exotic flowers... Past the
      fountains and statues -- up the steps to the open French
      doors. Long white curtains billow in the sea wind.

      Lestat steps in through billowing curtains, stops...
      There are three West Indian girls, young, voluptuous,
      beautiful, dressed in simple working clothes and
      traditional head-wraps. They stare at Lestat, nervous,
      yet fascinated. They move towards him. Lestat finds
      himself surrounded by hands, touching him, reaching
      beneath his shirt, pulling his clothes from his body. He
      swoons, closes his eyes, smiles.

      scented with red rose petals. Lestat's white skin breaks
      the surface. Lestat is lowered into the bath, his skin
      alive with the dancing candles reflected in the water...
      the water laps gently -- strange sighs of pleasure as
      girls' hands caress Lestat's torso... their hands reach
      down lower and lower through the water... Lestat's eyes
      remain closed but his mouth opens... Now it's Akasha
      kissing him. Lestat responds, but his eyes sneak a peek.
      Akasha smiles -- takes his head in her hands -- she
      kisses him, pushes him back -- he tries to resist -- he
      can't, startled by her strength... Akasha kisses his

      Akasha rises up from his breast, blood on her lips,

      disoriented. Akasha is nowhere to be seen. He looks
      toward the window. The sun is just about to disappear
      below the horizon. Lestat stares, amazed, blinking...
      Shielding his eyes, Lestat goes to window, gazes in awe
      at the setting sun. As the last rays slice through the
      sky, Lestat closes his eyes, stretches his arms out, feels
      the warm sun on his skin. He smiles at this feeling he's
      craved for so long. Still smiling, he opens his eyes,
      blinking from the light. He turns, gazes towards the
      bath and gasps. The dying light illuminates... The
      servant girls' bodies, now grey with death, lying around
      the edge of the bath. The roses are now black and the

      last of the sun's rays strikes ten dead bodies sitting
      around the table, some slumped onto their food, some
      frozen in death. Lestat moves through the room, a

      She crosses to him, her eyes locked on his. She lifts

</b>                   I want to hear it from every one
                   of you. What will it be?

      Akasha scans the faces of the other Ancient Ones, staring
      deep into their souls. Akasha sees Khayman glance at the
      family tree. Akasha's eyes blaze with anger.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                   Don't tell me, you have feelings
                   for these ridiculous mortals!

      She crosses to the family tree, traces the names down to
      one. Jessica Reeves. Akasha is beyond fury, yet she
      keeps her temper under control and turns to Lestat.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                   Do you love me?

      Smiling, she bites her lip, letting a drop of blood
      glisten there, tempting Lestat.

<b>                            LESTAT
</b>                   Yes...

      He draws closer. Jesse stares, mortified. Akasha and
      Lestat's mouths almost meet when Akasha pulls away.
      Akasha slowly turns to Jesse.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                   Prove it. Kill her.

                   I've had enough of this 'great
                   family.' It's time to end it.

      Maharet steps between Lestat and Jesse.

<b>                           MAHARET
</b>                   You will not touch her!

      Akasha flicks her wrist. Maharet is hurled against a
      pillar, pinned by Akasha's hand.

<b>                            AKASHA
</b>                   You still think to challenge me,

</b>                   Now.

      Maharet struggles but Akasha is too strong.     Jesse gazes
      at Lestat. Then steps forward.

<b>                           JESSE
</b>                   It's all right, Maharet.

      Maharet stops, standing fixed with the sound of Jesse's
      newly strong and calm voice. Jesse looks to Lestat,
      straight into his dark irises, her gaze absolutely
      unwavering.

<b>                           JESSE
</b>                   It's what I want.   I am ready.


      She reaches up, pulls aside her shirt, revealing the top
      of her breast. A thin, red scar remains from where she
      cut herself with the silver stick from the Chinese
      barrette.

      Lestat gazes at her, begins to advance. Jesse keeps her
      gaze steady into Lestat's, risking everything.

      Lestat moves closer and closer to her, gazes into her
      eyes, hesitates for a moment, then continues on...

      Jesse watches him with absolute love. He reaches her.
      Maharet flies across the room, but Akasha meets her
      halfway. Grabs her by the hair. Maharet struggles but
      Akasha is much more powerful. Jesse offers up her neck
      to his bite. Maharet looks away and Akasha looks pleased
      as...

      Lestat sinks his teeth into Jesse's neck. Jesse gasps
      with the bite, but puts her arm around Lestat as he draws
      her into him, draining her of her very life-force as she
      holds him.

      With that Maharet's great family mural begins to weep
      blood from every name. All the Ancients turn, stare at
      the mural as...

      Lestat drinks and drinks and Jesse sighs with intimacy,
      clutching his neck and back, and drawing his bite deeper
      into her flesh. She slowly crumples to the floor, being
      drawn down until finally...

      Jesse lies on the floor, eyes closed and pale.    Dead.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                   Good-bye, great family.

      She turns to the MURAL with a fierce gaze. Flash! It
      EXPLODES, CRUMBLING to a million pieces on the ground.
      Maharet stares in horror.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                   Now, my children, remember your
                   real family! Or else.

      She turns to them with a killing smile.

<b>                           LESTAT
</b>                   But, My Queen, you've forgotten my

      She turns to him.

</b>                   That's right. My King, you've

      Lestat smiles with a blood-stained mouth. Akasha
      approaches Lestat and offers him her vein. She looks
      scornfully at the others as he cradles her wrist...

                   you will all die!

      Lestat looks once at Marius, then sinks his teeth into
      its original font. He drinks as Akasha gasps with
      pleasure at giving so much pleasure to him. She keeps
      smiling to the others. But Lestat doesn't stop drinking.
      Akasha looks back to him, her face changing.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                   That's enough, Lestat.

      Still Lestat doesn't stop.

</b>                   Lestat.    Enough.   Stop!

      (NOTE: Scene as scripted here is quite different from
      what was analyzed in boards. Notable potential expense
      or savings indicated with brackets. [])

      But Lestat clamps down even harder.       Akasha thrashes,
      trying to release herself.

      Maharet and Marius realize what he's doing, see the
      chance Lestat has gained for them. A silent signal
      passes between them as...

      The Ancients make an instantaneous decision. Akasha
      looks up, gasping, in time to see Maharet, Marius,
      Khayman, Armand, Mael, Pandora flying towards her.
      Akasha lets out a hiss...

      Most of the Ancients are thrown to the ground while Mael
      ignites in mid-air. Mael's skin bubbles. He screams,
      the veins in his face rise up and explode as if his blood
      were burning acid...

      Pandora too bursts into flames.       She falls to the ground.

      But Lestat, strong with Akasha's blood, keeps his hold
      and Khayman, Armand, Marius, Maharet fly at her again.
      They swarm over Akasha. She rises into the air,
      thrashing about, but they hang on, forming a flying mass
      of flailing limbs.

      The THUMP of Akasha's HEART ACCELERATES as they try to
      drain her...

      Akasha turns on [Khayman to incinerate him. Flash. He
      screams as his blood boils, exploding out of his
      fingertips -- But he doesn't ignite... His wounds quickly
      heal. He moves in for another attack...]

      The Ancients are still flung around by Akasha's great
      strength, but they all hold on, as the thrashing finally
      begins to subside. The mass of bodies sinks to the
      ground. The Ancients pull back to reveal that...

      Akasha's skin is deathly blue white.    In horror, she
      manages to spit out her words.

<b>                           AKASHA
</b>                   You kill me, you kill yourselves.

      The Ancient Ones look to each other, uncertain a moment.

      Akasha gazes at them, then turns slowly, fixes her gaze
      on Lestat. He gazes back at her.

      Suddenly, Akasha takes her chance, rises, her eyes flare
      green, marshalling the last of her wrath. Lestat cries
      out in agony as smoke rises from his limbs.

      Fiercely determined, Lestat bites into Akasha's throat,
      this time for the kill. Akasha sinks her nails into his throat.
       He hangs on, his teeth deep. They are locked in mortal combat.
       Akasha slowly sinks to the ground, real
      fear in her eyes as her strength finally vanishes.

<b>                           MAHARET
</b>                   Wait, Lestat! You must stop!

      Lestat pulls away, leaving Akasha hanging in a twisted,
      unnatural angle.

      They all stare waiting to see what will happen...

      ... Maharet moves quickly. She strides over to Akasha
      and sinks her fangs into Akasha's neck. Akasha struggles
      but this time she cannot even rise up. Maharet does not
      stop. A HOWLING sound as if from hell fills the room.

      The Ancient Ones stare at Akasha, step back in awe.
      Lestat sits up, burned but still alive to see...

      Akasha's skin begins to grow horribly pale, to harden and
      cake into a chalk. There's no blood left to flow from
      the gaping holes in Akasha's flesh. She slowly begins to
      transform back to her frozen statue state. Her skin
      returning to MARBLE. CRACKS multiply, becoming fissures.
      Finally, Akasha literally falls to pieces, SMASHING on
      the stone floor like porcelain.

      A silent moment. The Ancient Ones look at each other,
      astonished, as they realize they're still "alive."

      The Ancients let out relieved hisses.

      But Lestat is only concerned about Jesse. He rushes to
      her, picks up her lifeless head, takes a dagger from the
      floor and slices his wrist. He brings the open vein to
      Jesse's mouth, but she's not moving. Lestat bends down
      to her ear and whispers.

<b>                           LESTAT
</b>                   I left you one drop, my love.
                   Drink deep and live.

      Jesse's lips slightly move and quiver as she tastes the
      blood. She begins to take the blood inside her and then
      finally truly drink and revive as Lestat cradles her.
      She pulls away, gasping. Lestat looks into her eyes.

<b>                           JESSE

      Her lips move to his wrist. Lestat strokes her hair,
      soothes her. Jesse gasps as pain courses through her.
      Lestat holds her close. She looks up at him, their eyes
      are locked together.

<b>                           LESTAT
</b>                   I will never leave you again.

      He holds her tight in his arms.

      All the Ancients gaze at Lestat, now understanding what
      he did.

      Slowly Jesse rises, gazes at Lestat, her face pale, her
      eyes glowing. Then Jesse turns, stares at Maharet. All
      the Ancients turn, follow her gaze.

      A whiteness is spreading across Maharet's face and skin.
      Maharet stares at her arms and legs, slowly turning to
      stone. Jesse goes to her.

      into a chair and freezes into a statue.

      The Ancients slowly bow to Maharet. Jesse slowly slips

      Lestat, content for the first time since we've known him,
      looks lovingly to Jesse. A flicker of curiosity crosses
      David's face.

<b>                           TALBOT
</b>                   Excuse me for asking but...

<b>                           JESSE
</b>                      (smiles)
                   What's it like?

<b>                             TALBOT
</b>                   Yes.

<b>                           JESSE
</b>                   Do you want to find out?

<b>                            TALBOT
</b>                   Me?... No. I'm too old to live
                   forever.

<b>                           JESSE
</b>                   Well, if you ever should change
                   your mind... Oh. I have a present
                   for you. From an old friend.

      She hands Talbot a canvas. It's a painting. He stares at
      it. The painting shows Lestat's concert. And in the
      crowd, Talbot finds Marius, now looking straight out at
      the viewer, a smile on his lips. Talbot sees standing
      beside Marius is Talbot himself, dancing with a young,
      pretty Goth. Talbot smiles.

<b>                           JESSE
</b>                   And Marius sent a message. You
                   were right. He doesn't go to the
                   Dorchester. But he's gonna be at
                   Claridge's later...

      Talbot stares at them.

<b>                           JESSE
</b>                   Well, I guess this is good-bye.

<b>                            TALBOT
</b>                   Yes.   Take care of her, Lestat.

<b>                             LESTAT
</b>                   Always.

      Talbot looks at Jesse, once his spiritual daughter.

<b>                           TALBOT
</b>                   Good-bye, Jesse.

      Talbot closes his eyes to shut out a tear, and Jesse is
      at his side and leans down to whisper in his ear...

<b>                           JESSE
</b>                   Good-bye, dear friend.

      Talbot opens his eyes to say something, but they're gone.
      Talbot turns to the painting. Stares at Marius for a
      long moment. Then stands, grabs his coat, heads for the
      door.

      Jesse and Lestat come out of the Talamascan headquarters.

      He takes her hand and together they float up over the
      wall and out to the street. Lestat pulls Jesse into his
      arms.

      They kiss. It's long, deep, romantic. They pull away,
      gaze sweetly, lovingly, into each other's eyes...

      And exchange happy, fanged smiles...

<b>                           LESTAT
</b>                   Shall we go get a drink, love?

      She smiles, nods. Lestat and Jesse take each other's
      hands, move into the crowd, zipping through the streets
      at that STRANGE preternatural SPEED...

      ... and vanish into the night.

<b>                                             FADE OUT.
