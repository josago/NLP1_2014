</b><b>          
</b>          A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the
          mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN
          ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          the old women. They SCREAM!
<b>          
</b>          The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the
          skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the
          sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          them.
<b>          
</b>          The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running
          and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR.
<b>          
</b>          The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY,
          flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and
          flashes ANOTHER GIRL.
<b>          
</b>          It's an all-out Pervert assault!
<b>          
</b>          The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a
          fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as
          quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an
          assassination.

</b>          HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages
          through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they
          see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater
          grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a

          has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his
          way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the

          starts SNORING loud as hell. Ronnie gets out of the

          in like a loving son. He pries the bottle from her
          fingers. Then, he grabs a pillow and goes to sleep on
          the floor.

                       end of the day, you know you've

                       drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota

                       it. Then you get a really                          
                       important job like Astronaut, no

                       be admitted to the police academy.
                       Now, I like to tell all new
                       recruits that they should complete
                       a ride along before making this
                       decision. It's where you actually
                       ride along with a real police
                       officer during a routine patrol.
                       It helps give you an idea of the
                       kind of situations you'll be
                       dealing with. Sound good?

                       everywhere. See, I have this                        
                       vision of evil trying to get at                     
                       the world from every angle and                      
                       there I stand at the top of it all                  
                       with my gun, just kind of blowing                   
                       it away. Just me and my weapons,                    
                       cleaning up this whole town. I                      
                       know I could do some good if I was                  
                       just given a chance and everybody                   
                       would be a lot better off.

                    time I made this job my whole
                    life. I looked at this mall as a
                    kingdom and I looked at Mark as
                    the King. I thought of myself as
                    the first Knight and the
                    customers, well, they were the
                    peasants. I lived by an old code
                    where one was bound by duty and
                    honor. But now I don't know if I
                    believe in that code anymore.
                    I've lost my way. Now I just feel
                    like it's one big kingdom of shit.
                    Right now, I got half a mind just                  
                    to let this whole place burn.

                       basically requires the same skill
                       set that someone in say the FBI
                       has. You have to use logic and
                       evidence and old-fashioned common
                       sense as well as the latest
                       technology to deduce the criminal
                       mind. It's what I do.
