<b>               CREDITS OVER PHOTOS IN AN ALBUM
</b>
               The photos include a sepia-tone portrait of an Italian 
               immigrant family... a b&w snapshot of ROBERTA, a nine-year-
               old girl playing violin in front of a refrigerator (1950)...

               ...Roberta and her dashing Italian father, hand-carving a 
               wooden music stand... a b&w snapshot of Roberta in a communion 
               dress... Roberta at 15, playing violin in front of the same 
               refrigerator, eyes on the music stand...

               ...a color photo of two cute blonde little boys building a 
               sandcastle on a beach... a color photo of a groom in a white 
               naval uniform and his pretty bride, (Roberta at 25), her 
               hand over his as they cut their wedding cake with a sword...

               ...a color photo of Roberta and her husband Greek dancing 
               with another couple at an outdoor taverna. Roberta's husband 
               and the other man's sexy wife are exchanging a slight smile...

               HOLD ON THIS LAST PHOTO as we now see the ALBUM open on the 
               floor of a bedroom, as if it's been tossed. We are:

</b>                         Wake up, Roberta!

               We hear the sound of KNOCKING as the CAMERA PANS a small, 
               darkened guest room. A few streaks of daylight filter through 
               Venetian blinds.

               The CAMERA finds a WOMAN lying face down on a twin bed, thick 
               wavy hair sprawled across her shoulders.

                         of that bed.

               The KNOCKING continues, and she puts the pillow over the top 
               of her head.

<b>               INT. GUASPARI BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
               The WOMAN -- ROBERTA GUASPARI-DEMETRAS (38) -- retrieves the 
               photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it. 
               She's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but 
               right now she looks like hell. She stares at the photo -- 
               it's the two couples dancing. A quick glimpse of hurt on her 
               face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half. 
               There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young 
               boys' voices.

<b>                                     BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                         Can you come out now, Mommy? Please?

               She puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser, 
               then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into 
               pieces.

<b>                                     BOY #2 (O.S.)
</b>                         Mommy, Nick broke my crayon!

<b>                                     BOY #1 (O.S.)
</b>                         Well, Lexi hit me and he almost 
                         broke... he almost broke my ear!

               O.S. arguing "I DID NOT!" "YES YOU DID!" "LIAR!" etc. As if 
               that one action siphoned all her energy, Roberta returns to 
               bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond 
               the wall, ignoring the O.S. voices.

<b>                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                         Hear that? Your boys need you.

<b>               EXT. GUASPARI HOUSE - DOORWAY - DAY
</b>
               ASSUNTA GUASPARI (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian-
               American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended 
               working-class home, addressing a young NAVAL OFFICER who 
               holds a lengthy delivery inventory. It's a gray day with 
               ominous storm clouds. Late 70's CARS are parked on the street.

<b>                                     ASSUNTA
</b>                         But I have no room for this!

<b>                                     OFFICER
</b>                         I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to 
                         deliver these.

               Assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed.

<b>               HER POV
</b>
               Large wooden CRATES cover her front lawn, and TWO MOVERS 
               plant down another. They hurry back to the TRUCK, grabbing 
               the next crate too quickly this time. It slips from their 
               hands, CRASHES to the ground and splinters open. Several 
               VIOLIN CASES spill out. The crate looks like it holds a whole 
               lot more.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE
</b>
               Instantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta 
               sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than 
               we've seen her so far.

<b>                                     ROBERTA
</b>                         Watch it, you idiots! Be careful 
                         with those!

               The men scramble to pick them up. Assunta looks at all the 
               violins, then up at Roberta.

<b>                                     ASSUNTA
</b>                         Why so many?

               Roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut.

<b>               INT. GUASPARI LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
               The living room is filled with boxes shipped from Greece, 
               labelled by the U.S. NAVY. And on the floor, in the middle 
               of the boxes, are FIFTY VIOLIN CASES of various sizes, also 
               with Greek and U.S. NAVY labels. NICK (7) and LEXI (5) climb 
               over the boxes as if they were giant blocks.

<b>               INT. GUASPARI HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               ROBERTA'S on the phone, yelling at someone. She's still in 
               the same ratty nightgown.

<b>                                     ROBERTA
</b>                         Look, I know he's there, so quit 
                         lying to me!... Then check under 
                         Lana Holden -- Mrs. Lana Holden... 
                         Fine. Just tell Lieutenant Demetras 
                         that his wife called and --

               ASSUNTA grabs the phone from her hand and hangs it up.

</b>                         No. I want you to listen to me. You 
                         can't keep doing this to yourself -- 
                         or to the boys. They need their mother 
                         now. You're a beautiful, talented 
                         woman and you have your whole life 
                         ahead of you.

<b>                                     ROBERTA
</b>                         If I'm so beautiful and talented, 
                         why did Charles leave me?

<b>                                     ASSUNTA

                         Now get dressed.

               She exits, leaving Roberta to mull over her words.

<b>               INT. GUASPARI KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
               Coffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on 
               a rack. We recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage. 
               As Assunta clears the boys' breakfast dishes from the table, 
               Roberta enters. She's dressed, but hasn't put on makeup or 
               done much with her hair. It's a start.

<b>                                     ROBERTA
</b>                         You really think Charles is a jerk?

</b>                         Since when do you listen to me?

               Roberta half-smiles, pours herself some coffee, then sits 
               down at the table.

<b>                                     ROBERTA

</b>                         First, you eat breakfast. Second, 
                         you go out and get a job -- any job. 
                         Your boys, god-bless-em, are good 
                         eaters -- but I can't afford it.

</b>                         Mama, he's gonna get tired of her -- 
                         you'll see.

               Assunta's face shows she's doubtful about this.

</b>                         Well in the meantime, get a job.

<b>               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - GIFT WRAP COUNTER - ROME, N.Y. - DAY
</b>
               Roberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present 
               with ribbons, bows and stickers. At one point she even unties 
               a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. She looks 
               pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy 
               housewife. There's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a 
               long line of impatient customers. A male SUPERVISOR appears 
               behind Roberta.

<b>                                     SUPERVISOR
</b>                         Just wrap. You're not Picasso.

               He exits, and Roberta quickly tries to finish her task.

</b>                         Picasso would probably put the bows 
                         on the back of the box.

               Roberta looks up to find BRIAN TURNER (40), a handsome, sexy 
               guy with longish hair and a beat-up leather jacket.

<b>                                     ROBERTA

                         birthday.

               He holds out his hand. Roberta misunderstands the gesture 
               and tries to shake his hand.

<b>                                     BRIAN

                         Oh! Sorry.

               Roberta hands him the gift she's been wrapping.

                         I heard you had a book published. I

                         it either. It looks good on their 
                         coffee table, though.

               Roberta smiles.

</b>                         My college professors said it was

                         training to be a concert violinist. 
                         So I got a teaching degree instead.

                         See, every time I'd get started 
                         somewhere, Charles would be 
                         transferred... then I had my kids 
                         and took time off to raise them... 
                         and then when I decided to teach 
                         again, no one would hire me 'cause 
                         you can't count on a navy wife to 
                         stick around. I finally decided I'd 
                         start my own program -- Charles gave 
                         me the money and I bought fifty 
                         violins from this little Greek shop -- 
                         got started at a private school and

                         bed. I go outside and our neighbor -- 
                         this old Greek guy -- is sitting out 
                         there, smoking a cigar, so I ask if 
                         he's seen my husband. "He's taking a 
                         walk with the other officer's wife," 
                         he says. "He takes a walk every night 
                         with the other officer's wife."

               A beat as she gets lost in the memory. She takes a bite of a

               JANET WILLIAMS, a Black woman (40's) with a kind face, sits

               Before Janet can answer, Roberta and the kids quickly take 
               out their violins and get into position. Janet and Dennis

               Roberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys. The three of 
               them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an 
               ETUDE in three-part harmony. For the first measures, Janet's

                         Don't do that! Put the bows back in 
                         the cases -- right now!

               There's the SOUND of violin strings being plucked.

               Roberta wheels around to find a girl plucking her violin 
               like a banjo, and doing a little dance. This is LUCY, a skinny 
               Puerto Rican girl in perpetual motion.

               Roberta takes a breath. The kids settle down a bit.

               With a sheepish expression, he exits. The room is finally 
               quiet -- and Roberta's amazed that something worked. She 
               puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control.

               In front of the class, Roberta helps NAEEM, a graceful Black 
               boy, hold the violin. He has a serious expression and a scar 
               on his left cheek. Roberta controls the bow and fingerboard, 
               but it appears that the boy is playing music. He smiles.

               Roberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her

               couch that's been made up as a bed. Leftist political books 
               line a shelf above Brian's desk, including copies of his

               In contrast, Roberta seems to be moving in slow motion.

               We see in her face that part of her did think that.

                         know where to buy groceries.

               Brian softens as he sees how vulnerable she is. He takes her 
               in his arms.

               He kisses her forehead, then exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking 
               hurt and frightened.

               Roberta rosins her bow, standing in front of ten kids -- 
               third through fifth-grade -- who sit on the floor next to 
               their violin cases. The kids are Black and Latino, with a 
               couple of white faces. They're all talking and ignoring 
               Roberta except for NAEEM and GUADALUPE, a petite Mexican 
               girl with a long dark braid. [NOTE: We'll see other violin

                         think you're stupid?

               This makes De Sean blush -- and it pisses him off.

               Some kids giggle and joke about this. Roberta points to the 
               scroll of the violin.

               LUCY, the fidgety girl, snaps her fingers.

               The kids laugh. Roberta doesn't. She points to the scroll.

               Dennis's twenty students play recorder in rows of attached 
               theatre-style seats. Dennis sits at his desk, a METRONOME 
               ticking, and apathetically leads them in scales, using a red 
               pen as a baton. He keeps one eye on a stack of quizzes that 
               he's marking, stopping to circle mistakes with the pen.

               Guadalupe tries to correct her feet. Roberta bends down to 
               help and sees that the little girl wears LEG BRACES under 
               her pants. Roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys.

                         It's probably better for you to sit.

               NAEEM'S MOTHER, MRS. ADISA, steps INTO FRAME. She's an 
               attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of 
               African fabric.

                         music -- and that makes him feel 
                         good about himself. Why should it

                         white women come up here and think 
                         you can rescue our poor inner city 
                         children who never asked to be rescued

               While she waits, she looks at Brian's picture on the book 
               jacket. There's no answer and she hangs up. She starts to

               Roberta walks through crowds of kids towards Janet who's in 
               the middle of confronting a boy student. Janet holds a FIFTY-

                         with his legs too. He walks with two

               Guadalupe nods. Roberta holds out the violin case. Guadalupe 
               lunges forward and hugs her around the waist. Roberta 
               awkwardly accepts the hug, startled and touched by it, and 
               strokes the girl's hair. Guadalupe lets go, takes the violin 
               and exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA as she absorbs what just happened. 
               JANET pokes her head into the room.

               Roberta walks around an empty, rundown apartment, her 
               expression somber. Crayon markings on the walls, cigarette 
               burns on the floors, a filthy bathroom and kitchen. An older 
               Puerto Rican woman stands back as Roberta inspects the place. 
               Roberta wipes grease off one of the windows.

               them and Lexi runs up to her, carrying a piece of artwork.

               background decorated with glued-on macaroni. It says DADDY.

               On the street below, three prostitutes stand at the corner. 
               Two men sit on a stoop, smoking a joint, and in a parked 
               car, three men seem to be making a drug deal. One of the

</b>                         It was the day of Grandpa's birthday, 
                         and I was sad because he had died a 
                         few months back.

               A group of kids stand together with their violins and chat. 
               Roberta exits the building and they greet her. She waves 
               back, but she's clearly still upset by her interaction with 
               Lucy. She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them.

                         anybody. I'm a single mother and I 
                         needed a job. And I know you think 
                         you're protecting your son, but you're 
                         not. I mean, what if Arthur Ashe's 
                         mother had stopped him from playing 
                         tennis because it's a "white man's 
                         game"?
                              (beat)
                         The important thing is that when 
                         Naeem plays music, his whole face 
                         lights up. You should see him.

               Mrs. Adisa takes this in. Roberta exits. Mrs. Adisa looks 
               for Naeem and sees him watching the violin students, longing 
               to be among them. She watches her son with compassion.

               in their neighborhood.

               The boys suddenly rush over to A MAN sitting on the ground 
               with mixed-breed PUPPIES in a cardboard box. The boys pet 
               them excitedly. Roberta watches her sons; they're happier 
               than she's seen them in ages.

                         If they're gonna learn an instrument, 
                         they need to take it seriously --

                         too harsh. I'm sure you might be 
                         able to soften some of your comments 
                         to the children?

               badly. They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.

               Lexi looks upset; Nick is stoic. Roberta hugs them one last 
               time. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT steps forward.

               The FLIGHT ATTENDANT escorts them into the jet way. Roberta 
               holds back tears as they get further away from her. At the 
               last moment, Lexi turns and waves; Nick does not. Roberta 
               waves, tears starting to fall, and the boys disappear from 
               sight. She observes all the families travelling together, 
               and feels like the loneliest person in the airport.

<b>               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Roberta enters her apartment, back from the airport, and 
               double-locks the door behind her. You can see on her face 
               that she's dreading the emptiness. She crosses to a small 
               Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and 
               plugs in the tiny blinking lights. It's not exactly 
               Rockefeller Center. She turns on the T.V., playing IT'S A 
<b>               WONDERFUL LIFE.
</b>
               She crosses to the kitchen, then returns with a carton of 
               eggnog, a glass, and a bottle of rum. She sits down on the 
               couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum, 
               goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles 
               some on top, then drinks. She sighs, glancing miserably at 
               the tree and the T.V. Pathetic. She couldn't look any less 
               festive if she tried. There's a KNOCK on the DOOR.

               Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.

               She looks through the peephole, then quickly unlocks the 
               door and opens it, revealing BRIAN, giving her a big smile.

               He looks sexy as hell (even with a silly lit-up Santa Claus 
               pin on his leather jacket), and he holds a long-stemmed red 
               rose in one hand, and a Christmas present in the other.

               Roberta's thrilled and relieved to see him. She embraces 
               him, and they kiss passionately.

               A mild winter day. Roberta, covered with plaster dust and 
               overheated from working, leans against a car and drinks a 
               beer. The three-story brick building has some graffiti on it 
               and is badly in need of a paint job; there are a few broken 
               windows, and the front stairs need repairing. WORKMEN file 
               in and out. We can see from the STREET SIGNS that we're on 
               118th STREET, a few houses off FIRST AVENUE.

               Brian (also dust-covered), Nick and Lexi toss around a 
               football. LAWRENCE (6), a Black boy who lives next door, 
               joins them. Brian crosses to Roberta, sweaty and out of 
               breath. He takes a swig of her beer.

               She laughs and they kiss.

               ASSUNTA comes up the street with a bag of take-out food. She 
               casts a dubious glance at the lovers.

               hangs back. Assunta calls to him.

                         it's a fantasy to think of marriage 
                         lasting these days. One out of two 
                         marriages ends in divorce!

                         forget marriage for a minute; I'm 
                         just talking about a relationship -- 
                         would you go to someone else?

               Roberta looks very disheartened. Brian feels badly.

               Nick stomps off to get his violin. Lexi follows. Roberta 
               puts down her bag and takes off her coat. While Lexi sets up 
               his violin, Nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin

               Nick THROWS the violin against the floor. Roberta's

               Nick and Lexi look very upset, not only from hearing the

               to cry and Roberta holds him too.

               plays SPANISH MUSIC, and the PAINTERS' radio plays a RAP

               The fifty fifth-grade students play the "Twinkle" variations. 
               Their playing is impeccable and they look terrific.

               As the CAMERA PANS the audience, we recognize: MRS. ADISA, 
               tears in her eyes as she watches Naeem; MRS. LAMB and her

               sitting with ASSUNTA, NICK and LEXI; JANET, impressed as 
               hell; and DENNIS, seething with jealousy. As the kids start 
               the jazz variation of "Twinkle," a WOMAN elbows her husband:

               The students are now playing "Allegro," and they reach the

               and knocks. No response. She knocks again.

               "Lightly Row." Roberta walks around, making corrections as 
               she addresses the students. She doesn't see Justin poking 
               Ramon with his bow; Ramon swats the bow away and glares at 
               his nemesis. Roberta moves some of Shandra's braids away 
               from the violin.

               SCREECHING comes from Ramon's room as he practices "Lightly 
               Row." His brothers, PEDRO (18) and ERNESTO (17), cringe as 
               they try to watch T.V. Ernesto gives up and puts on his 
               Walkman; Pedro's ready to break the violin. Concepcion listens 
               patiently as she folds laundry, but even she winces.

               JUSTIN is struggling more than the other students. Roberta 
               plays along with the class, eyeing each student.

               knocks over Ramon's music stand.

               violin. Roberta nears the front door and finds Isabel and

               "blessing" kids with his violin bow.

               Roberta enters slowly. She looks very shaken up. She takes 
               note of what Ramon is doing, and overhears Toussaint and 
               Shandra in mid-conversation.

               Roberta brings in the mail, looking curiously at a manila 
               envelope with a return address from the NY REVIEW OF BOOKS. 
               She opens it, looks inside, then pours out a batch of other

               Roberta, Nick and Lexi play Haydn's "Trio #13" together on

               The DOORBELL rings and Roberta jumps up, bolting into the 
               bathroom down the hall.

               Lexi and Nick exchange a smile, then Lexi crosses to the

</b>                         It's not me, Roberta. The Board of 
                         Ed. cut the budget, the District had 
                         to comply, and as of the end of this 
                         term, the violin program has been... 
                         excessed.

               Roberta takes this in, momentarily speechless. In the b.g., 
               the beginners slip into the hall to watch.

                              (beat)
                         They specifically said that my violin 
                         program has to go.

                         and art programs got hit the worst.

                         has never been permanent.

               SEVENTY-FIVE KIDS play "We Shall Overcome" and it's incredibly

               fill with tears. She tries to stay composed, then discreetly 
               exits the auditorium.

               quickly. Dorothea snaps more pictures. Roberta extends an 
               arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them. Ramon

               3. Parents -- including Beverly Wilson, Concepcion, Mr. Adams 
               and Carlos' mom and dad -- stuff envelopes with INVITATIONS 
               to "FIDDLEFEST" and accompanying LETTERS and TICKET ORDER 
               FORMS. Roberta and Dorothea open envelopes with filled-out 
               TICKET ORDER FORMS and CHECKS. They stack the checks in a 
               pile, address return envelopes and place FIDDLEFEST TICKETS 
               inside them.

               Thirty-three excited kids from Roberta's different classes 
               chat, tune their violins, rosin their bows. The students 
               include Carlos, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Rachel, Simon, 
               Ramon, Vanessa, and Shandra. Roberta enters the room, full 
               of energy, and addresses them as she heads to the front.

                         the pressure. It's gonna be a lot of 
                         work -- a lot. Right now, we've sold 
                         some tickets, but I'm not gonna be 
                         back here in the fall if the audience 
                         storms out of their seats, demanding 
                         a refund!

               She nods to Rachel who starts handing out sheets of music.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - Two young men and two young women walk in, 
               carrying violins. We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM 
               (20), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall. 
               With him is DE SEAN (19), a short guy with dreadlocks, looking 
               more like a rapper than a violinist. GUADALUPE (19), walking 
               with a cane, is now a beautiful young woman, her long braid 
               pinned up. The fourth is a reserved Puerto Rican woman (20).

               his mom are squirming. Manuelo nods as he finishes reading,

               He dashes off, a barrage of Spanish and English curses behind 
               him, and crosses to his sister, waiting for him DOWN THE

               She stands on the empty stage, gazing at the ceiling as she 
               slowly turns around. She's holding her violin case. She looks 
               at the UPPER BALCONIES -- THE LOWER BALCONIES -- THE ORCHESTRA 
               SEATS. Her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of

               We can see her imagining the audience on the night of the 
               concert. She can't believe her eyes. A beat, and she looks 
               around to make sure she's alone. She takes out her violin, 
               takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her "audience," 
               then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach Double 
               Concerto. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening. 
               Roberta stops.

               A few kids start playing "CAN-CAN." It catches on, and more 
               of them join in. PASSERSBY stop to listen, and some drop 
               change into the open cases. RAMON and a couple of other kids 
               grin at this.

               CARLOS steps in front of the kids as he plays, and begins an 
               uncanny imitation of Roberta:

               The kids crack up, but a few spot ROBERTA heading quickly up 
               the street. Carlos is oblivious to this -- and no one signals 
               him that Roberta's watching.

               Carlos senses a presence and turns to see Roberta. A tense 
               beat as he awaits her reaction.

               Roberta talks to Janet with a worried expression.

</b>                         When I became the principal of Central 
                         Park East Elementary, I envisioned a 
                         school where children could fulfill 
                         their highest potential, despite the 
                         challenges of poverty and racism. 
                         Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked 
                         into my office because she needed a 
                         job, and because she had a vision 
                         that any child could learn the violin. 
                         We put our dreams together and created 
                         the East Harlem Violin Program which 
                         has helped more than a thousand 
                         students expand their vision of what's 
                         possible in their lives. When a 
                         program like this is cut, our 
                         children's future is compromised. I 
                         want to thank you for your support. 
                         Enjoy the concert.

               holds up her hands to quiet down the anxious students.

                         know you can play. You'll be 
                         wonderful. Watch me, don't look out 
                         in the audience -- you don't need to 
                         be afraid. It's gonna be really

               The kids head out towards the stage, the APPLAUSE getting 
               louder as they get closer.

               Some of the kids look awestruck by the audience; one subtly 
               waves hi to her family. Roberta walks out to APPLAUSE. She 
               bows to the audience, turns to the kids, signals them with a 
               slight nod and the BACH MINUET ONE begins. We've heard it in 
               all phases, and now it is flawless.

               PAN the STUDENTS watching her: VANESSA, wearing a corsage; 
               SIMON in his red bow tie; SHANDRA in black velvet with pearls; 
               NAEEM standing proud and tall, DE SEAN in dreadlocks and a

               The students finish MINUET ONE. There's an exquisite moment 
               of silence, then APPLAUSE.

               Country fiddler MARK O'CONNOR plays ORANGE BLOSSOM SPECIAL 
               with the kids. He improvises, surprising them as his violin 
               makes the sound of a TRAIN moving through a tunnel.

               RAMON smiles, awed by this -- but he remains calm and 
               professional.

               As the guest violinists head for the stage, we hear their 
               names over a mike, mixed with APPLAUSE:

               CRANE SHOT of the six guest violinists on stage for the Grand 
               Finale, each one sharing a music stand with a student. Roberta 
               nods, and they begin THE BACH DOUBLE CONCERTO. She turns to 
               face the audience as she joins them.

               MOVE IN AND PAN the performers and students: NAAEM shares a 
               stand with ARNOLD STEINHARDT; ISAAC STERN stands and plays 
               with GUADALUPE, sitting beside him; ITZHAK PERLMAN sits and 
               plays next to CARLOS, standing beside him; MICHAEL TREE plays 
               beside DE SEAN; DIANE MONROE plays beside LUCY; KAREN BRIGGS 
               plays beside THOMAS, and MARK O'CONNOR plays beside STEPHANIE. 
               NICK plays cello; LEXI plays the piano behind them; and, 
               playing with her own solo music stand, ROBERTA.

               Their expressions are serious and passionate, broken by 
               occasional smiles lighting on faces: Isaac Stern... Lucy... 
               Carlos... Itzhak Perlman... Diane Monroe... De Sean.

               The song finishes and the APPLAUSE begins. The OTHER 
               FIDDLEFEST PLAYERS come out from back stage, RAMON in front, 
               and join the rest. More applause. The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO 
               INCLUDE the audience facing the stage, then REVERSES to show 
               the audience standing in the orchestra and balconies.

               We see the students' PARENTS; JANET, ISABEL and their 
               families; ASSUNTA, LAWRENCE and DOROTHEA; DAN; CONCEPCION, 
               MANUELO and their sons; BRIAN; and DENNIS -- even he can't 
               stop himself from applauding.

               BACK AGAIN to the stage where the students and guest 
               violinists bow... and MOVE IN CLOSER on ROBERTA in her moment 
               of triumph.

               Roberta addresses the audience. Her voice is strong but softer 
               around the edges; she is a woman in a state of grace.

<b>               CRAWL:
</b>
               Roberta Guaspari lives in East Harlem with her daughter Sofia, 
               whom she adopted from El Salvador. Nick is a professional 
               cellist in a graduate music program, and Alexi has been 
               accepted to medical school.

               Roberta teaches violin to approximately 150 students a year 
               in three East Harlem elementary schools. The East Harlem 
               Violin Program, however, is still not funded by the New York 
               City Board of Education.

               The money raised from Fiddlefest supported Roberta's violin 
               program for three years. Roberta and Opus 118 continue their 
               fundraising efforts to keep the program alive.
