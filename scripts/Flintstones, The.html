    FRED FLINTSTONE, archetypical Everyman, sits atop his
    faithful heavy-equipment dinosaur, cranking the winch
    that makes the mighty beast rip and tear into the quarry
    wall.

<b>2   THE QUARRY FOREMAN                                         2
</b>    looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a
    wrist sundial. And it's magic time... quittin' time...
    Millerock time!
    Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle
    bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of
    the workday --

</b>    Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the
    canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the
    tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and
    timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only
    motor (his feet), slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur
    to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back
    up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and

    reading "FLINTSTONE." We WIDEN as Fred SKIDS to a halt
    in the driveway of his three-bedroom ranch cave. A
    moment later, WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking
    just like they should -- and get into the car. A beat
    behind them are the Flintstone pets, Dino and the
    saber-toothed cat.
    Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN... BARNEY,
    BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house, hop
    in!

    Fred and company pull in. He takes a giant sea shell
    "speaker" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his
    car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma.
    (In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through
    the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and
    puts them on his head for a better view. CAMERA ZOOMS IN
    ON the drive-in screen and the words that America has
    waited twenty-five years to see in 70mm Dolby(TM) drop-

    Dew drips from strange multi-leafed plants. Giant
    DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from
    a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land.
    (The third one out carries a little suitcase.)

    CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a
    DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange,
    hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then
    WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven-
    foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus.
    It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a
    canvas sack, but we don't stress this.)

    Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs
    over the Xenosaurus.

</b>
    Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize
    that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the
    shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads
<b>    BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE
</b>    EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and
    we see -- Bedrock!

</b>     Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming
     protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light.

     The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills
     out. Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight.

     It reaches the crest of a hill where there's a "WELCOME
     TO BEDROCK" billboard which bears greetings from the
     Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, and (of course)
     The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes. The garbage truck
     guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and
     trot over the rise, coast down to the street below.
     The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and
     the rear guys hop off. One of them waves to --

</b>     who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone
     bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway.
     As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big
     TORTOISE with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise
     nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the
     curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage men take the cans
     off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.

     giant-jawed   CREATURE strapped onto the chassis. The
     garbage men   dump the cans into its maw... it happily
     swallows the   works, licks its lips, BELCHES.

     The garbagemen slam the cans back on the Tortoise, who
     winces as they drive off.

     It waddles back up the lawn... passing by a wooden "lawn
     timer" box which now pops open.
     Inside the box is a "ROOSTERSAURUS" which CROWS and flaps
     its wings. The motion of the wings knocks loose two
     round stones which roll down two long troughs a la Rube
     Goldberg...

<b>12   FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES                                12
</b>     They reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging
     a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn
     spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. As
     it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its
     snout.

     Elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat
     this performance. After a moment, they gradually slow
     their revolutions. The one closest to the house
     scrunches its trunk with a GROAN.

     WIDEN FROM the windowsill, where a little sea shell
     hearing aid trumpet AMPLIFIES another ROOSTERSAURUS
     "COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO" into the ear of a "CLOCK RADIO
     WOODPECKER." The Woodpecker yawns, gets out of bed,
     puts a timecard in a little clock. Then it turns
     and begins pecking on a BELL, which RINGS PIERCINGLY.

<b>14   INT. BEDROOM - NEW ANGLE                                  14
</b>     Two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: One is a
     great SNORING bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe
     shape. As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger bulge
     GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then
     finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper
     is thrown without aiming --

               even a health plan...

     He staggers back up to his perch, and then notices for
     the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not
     to "ALARM" but to "ALARM & RADIO." The WOODPECKER SIGHS,
     looks over at the bed where SNORING is still emanating.
     Then the bird swings a little telescope around to point
     out the window.

</b>     Perched on top of the wooden radio tower are a monkey
     and an octopus. The monkey holds up cue cards which the
     octopus reads, and then waves nautical semaphore flags.

     The big bulge GRUNTS and MUTTERS a bit, then one hand
     gropes around, finds the curvaceous form under the
     neighboring covers... feels it tentatively... then
     the fingers "walk" upwards...

                  by cooling breezes and a protracted
                  ice age...
     Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the
     covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's
     face... the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his
     face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble.

                  your Freddy-weddy?
     And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is
     immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed
     and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.

                  warned that if new supplies of
                  kibble are not found, our animal-
                  powered civilization itself may be
                  threatened.

     By now Dino's affection   attack has knocked both master
     and pet to the floor in   a jumble of bedclothes, asses
     and elbows. Dino begins    to roll Fred across the room
     like a seal playing with   a ball.

     Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a
     brightly-colored box labeled "PURINROCK DINO TREATS."
     Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs, eager for
     the treat -- Fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes
     out.
     DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room.

                  Like, you know, the boogyman?
                  There's no such thing as a huge,
                  inhuman reptile that attacks

     WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window
     and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is
     happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously
     unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the
     slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill,
     looks out.

     "YI-YI-YI-YI!" DINO buys it again, runs to the door,
     lets himself out. This time Fred puts a chair against
     the door.

     Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER
     POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were
     the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit
     who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the
     toast, the Lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then
     looks TOWARDS the CAMERA.

     Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge. As its

     (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a
     bit more, then collapses from exhaustion).
     Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and
     ends, plus various inventions and scale models in
     different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a
     number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work).
     Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green
     material.

     Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood
     into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.

     Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of

     satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock
     weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out
     of his skin.

     OFFICER GRAVEL. Cackling with anticipation, Feldspar
     opens a box marked radar detector. Out pops a little
     bird in a police helmet. It has a stopwatch (actually,
     stop-sundial) around its neck. Feldspar points -- the
     bird salutes -- takes off!

     alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note
     to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice
     as --

                  out of Ceolanth caviar so I got
                  Mastodon brie instead. Oh, ah,

     The members are milling about the main room, schmoozing,
     drinking, kibitzing. All wear the furry and horned
     ceremonial Fez of the Buffalo.

     One wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge
     coat of arms (with the motto "Ackus Ackus Adackus" below);
     a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various
     bowling trophies, balls and pins. At the lectern, the
     HERDMASTER (a mustachioed, inspirational type) bangs
     again for order.

     the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium
     as the noise dies down.

     Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up
     tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it
     to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big
     "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster.
     Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does,
     Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his
     pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches
     up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it,
     continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands
     Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each
     other like a Pharaoh's badges of office.

     Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down,
     and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.

     rumbling down the alley,   sending pins flying. The

     not all) of these Lodge   members also work at the quarry.

     "cranks" down   a shelf with several monkeys on it. The

     up. Then the    shelf cranks back up.

                 you invented this Fibrerock stuff,
                 how Slate and Lava found out about
                 it by accident and all, but what
                 would that be?

                 can't start telling the truth,
                 it'd create the wrong impression.

     Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.

                          stumped)
                 I'll tell you. A front man. A
                 guy who's out in the public eye
                 running the point, fighting the
                 crowds... and meanwhile... back
                 in the corner is the silent
                 partner.

<b>                               BARNEY

<b>                               FRED

                 is always silent.

<b>106   MONTAGE - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY                                  106
</b>
      Now, accompanied by heroic "industrial"-type MUSIC, we
      see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation.

      This cannot be described    now with appropriate justice,
      but it involves a series    of animal-powered conveyor
      belts, Rube Goldberg-like    funnels, spouts and chutes,
      and all sorts of gadgets,    gizmos, bells and whistles,
      to wit:

</b>      At one end of the building, dino-powered dumpsters and
      lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped/
      chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is
      then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with
      water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill-
      type trough and is held back by a gate.

      Meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone
      sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which
      butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of
      a clay mold. When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed
      aside, Barney appears and personally "aims" the foam
      trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. Pausing to
      "taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts --

<b>                                 BARNEY
</b>                   Ready... aim... fibre!
      Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough.     "Fibrefoam"
      pours into the mold.
<b>107   THE CLAY MOLD                                                 107

</b>      Presto! A Fibrerock copy     of the stone sofa drops neatly
      out of the mold, bounces    lightly on the conveyor belt
      below! It sparkles with     the tell-tale celadon-green
      shimmer of Fibrerock. As     it chugs along, the process
      repeats, and soon a score    of identical sofas is in view.

<b>109   END OF ASSEMBLY LINE                                          109
</b>      as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the
      Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed). Nearby, we see
      Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc.

      Slate is practicing    hitting golf balls into an automatic
      putting cup. Lava     and some office workers are checking
      a blueprint against    a model of "Slate City" which is made
      out of Fibrerock.     A ball shoots back at Slate, who tees
      up again.

      the ball. Stopping it with his little hockey stick, the

      the door. Startled, Slate drives the ball instead of

                members of Amalgamated Neolithic
                101... which means that most of us
                aren't gonna be able to make our
                cave payments next month. So my
                agenda for tonight... ends right
                now. There's a time to be a
                Buffalo... there's a time ta be a
                brown nosin' double-crossin'
                creep...
      All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.

                and be a man! So let's go down
                there and make the Slate shop into
                slate scrap... then we'll see how
                he gets along without the heavy
                equipment operators of Neolithic
                101! Meeting adjourned!

      With angry grumbles and threats, the meeting breaks up.
      Fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are
      slapped on. The Buffalo run out.
      When the dust clears, we see that only one member has
      avoided the herding instinct: Barney.
      Now, he turns, runs into --

      beer. Then Barney runs up, shakes him by the shoulders.

      Led by Piltdown, the workers have grabbed a big timber
      which they're using like a battering ram on the doors of

      doors go down! Piltdown and Pyrite stand back while the

      Finally they slam broadside into the main Quarry build-

      Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of

      in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe...

      ... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now
      jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand
      drill.

      Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the
      tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away,
      vanishing just as our heroes stir.

      rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour-
      aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some
      stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite
      begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while
      Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams
      which he flings below.

                   of, so I'll tell you what... I'm
                   going to give you back all
                   world-wide rights to Fibrerock,
                   free and clear.
      He picks up a fragment of stone, begins writing on it.

</b>      Several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby
      pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another
      shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and
      digs in! Seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out
      their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of
      Fibrerock crumbs.

</b>      Now DINO "YI-YI-YI'S" past this group and leaps into the
      pile, munching like crazy.

      Barney puts out his hand as chunks of Fibrerock shower
      down like rain from the feeding frenzy. Catching some
      pieces, he nibbles on it a little.

      Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching
      animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with
      the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth...
      chews. His eyes widen...

      We're back where we began. As "The End" appears on the
      drive-in screen, cars are streaming out of the drive-in
      theatre. The Flintstone car is among them.
<b>296   EXT. DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                              296

      Fred and company roll into a '50's-style drive-in
      restaurant. A sign advertises BRONTO BURGERS AND RIBS.

</b>      A pretty carhop on stone roller skates glides over.
      Fred holds up one finger towards her. She nods, scampers
      O.S. Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici-
      pation... and then the girl returns with a massive rack
      of ribs on a car tray. She hooks it on the edge of
      the driver's door... and the entire car tips over with a
      crash.

      WIDEN FROM the mailbox. Fred and family pull up. Dino
      runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already
      asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth
      cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a
      milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down
      beside it. He shuts the door.
      Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window.
      Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then
      slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the
      door... it's locked!
