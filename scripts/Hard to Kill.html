</b><b>FADE IN:
</b>

<b>EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - EARLY EVENING
</b>
A modest but handsome home in the foothills above Gower.

<b>SUPERIMPOSE: "1983"
</b>
A young boy, SONNY STORM, rushes out -- excited but pouty
and a little peeved. He glowers at a 1981 Mercury, parked
at the curb -- then turns back toward the house.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>                  (calls back to
                   house)
           Daddy! I don't want you to go!


<b>MASON STORM
</b>
emerges from the house -- wearing a dark Gianni Versace
sport coat with a black vest underneath, carrying some
kind of case in his hand. He looks great -- a man of
action, not dandified at all by the snappy attire. He
squints down toward Sonny, proudly -- very much the family
man.

Mason's pretty wife, FELICIA, appears in the doorway.

<b>                          FELICIA
</b>                  (calls to Sonny)
           Your father has work to do, Sonny
           ... but he'll be home soon. And
           we'll all watch it together.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>           You promise, Dad?

<b>                          STORM
</b>           I promise.

Storm and Felicia come down to car, his arm around her.
Sonny grabs his father's shirtsleeve.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>           Daddy ...
                  (very serious)
           Daddy, is E.T. gonna win?

<b>                          STORM
</b>           He's got my vote.

Storm laughs and ruffles his son's hair.

<b>                         FELICIA
</b>                 (tight to Storm)
          I want you back early. Tonight's
          the night those little starlets are
          crawling all over town.

<b>                        STORM
</b>          Don't worry. I'll beat 'em off
          with a stick.

He kisses Felicia, ready to leave.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>          Daddy
                 (wants him to
                  stay)
          What about my joke?

Storm lifts Sonny up into his arms. He gives the boy
100% of his attention, speaks just for him.

<b>                          STORM
</b>          Knock knock.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>          Who's there?

<b>                          STORM
</b>          Old lady.

<b>                          SONNY
</b>          Old lady who?

<b>                         STORM
</b>          I didn't know you could yodel.

Sonny may not get the joke, but he laughs delightedly --
just because it's his dad telling it. Storm kisses him
and sets him down.

<b>                         FELICIA
</b>                 (to Storm)
          Take my advice: Don't give up your
          day job.

<b>TITLES BEGIN.
</b>

<b>INT. STORM'S CAR - MOVING - POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD NIGHT
</b>
Freeway traffic. Smoke in the sky ... flames ... the oil
refineries south of Torrance. A police RADIO is on, LOW,
and we can hear the SQUAWKING COMMUNIQUES in the b.g.

We become aware of a black limousine, ahead in the traffic.

in his hand.

             Karl ... wake up.


<b>INTERCUT POLICE STATION - DETECTIVES ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
KARL BECKER, Storm's partner, a nice guy in shirtsleeves
with a huge nautical-type wristwatch. He's wide awake
all right -- eager for this call.

<b>                            KARL
</b>                    (into radio)
             I'm here, Mase. Where are you


<b>EXT. HARBOR FREEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Storm's Mercury moves discreetly, tailing the limo.

<b>                            STORM
</b>             On the Harbor ... south of Torrance.
             I got Calabrese right in my

Suddenly he is more alert, slowing the car.


<b>LIMO

veers toward an upcoming exit ramp.

<b>                            STORM (V.O.)

As the limo passes and, moments later, Storm's car.

</b>           Keep off the skyline, amigo.
                  (by the way)
           Lou Gossett just won Best Supporting.

<b>TITLES END.
</b>

<b>EXT. COMMERCIAL PIER - NIGHT
</b>
The limousine  slowly moves   up beside a stand-alone shack
near the edge  of the wharf.    The shack is an open shelter
with a broad  overhang, and   various kinds of equipment
stored inside  it. A single    bulb illuminates it. The
limo comes to  rest, engine   off, no apparent activity in
or out of the  vehicle.


<b>STORM'S CAR
</b>
pulls up at a distance, deep in shadow.


<b>INT. STORM'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
He switches OFF the RADIO, twists a telephoto night lens
onto a specially silenced 8mm surveillance film camera;
he primes a portable sound deck in the case he's been
carrying. A quick check of the .45 in his shoulder
holster, then he exits the car.


<b>ON STORM
</b>
Moving carefully onto the wharf, keeping to shadow, using
cover.


<b>EXT. WHARF - NIGHT
</b>
Stacks of huge shipping crates and Sea-Land containers
from a long wall along the cluttered dock. The towering
hulks of several ships loom close by. Storm finds a slot
between bulk containers: a good surveillance point.

<b>                             STORM
</b>           Let's go, boys.     I'm missing the
           Oscars.

He is less than forty yards away, looking lengthwise down
the car from its rear. A beat, as Storm picks up the
sound before we do.

<b>STORM'S POV - STATION WAGON
</b>
A paneled, expensive model approaches. The wagon pulls
up, a short distance from the limo. A man gets out from
the wagon. A beat later, the driver exits the limo.
Both are armed. They check out the area, in all
directions.


<b>SHACK
</b>
One man crosses under the eave of the shack -- reaches
up, SMASHES the single LIGHT BULB. The spot goes dark.


<b>WITH STORM
</b>
Seeing the doors open on both cars. A mature man,
CALABRESE, and his stocky confederate, VITALE, step from
the limo. TWO other MEN -- one wearing a stylish hat,
the other bareheaded -- step from the wagon. They cross
to the shadowed, shack area.

<b>                             STORM (O.S.)
</b>                    (to himself,
                     softly)
             I know you, Calabrese. But who are
             these mystery guests?

The two Shadow Men are obscured by the shack and the
position of Calabrese and Vitale.


<b>STORM
</b>
Starts his camera soundlessly whirring. He positions his
high-tech directional mike, slipping on earphones.


<b>WHARF - CONSPIRATORS
</b>
There is NOISE from various wharf MACHINERY on adjacent
piers, but the high-tech listening equipment still brings
in the sound with acceptable clarity.

<b>                            CALABRESE
</b>             -- Murder is a serious business, my
             friend. And an expensive one.

<b>                            SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
</b>             You'll be well compensated,
             Calabrese. Money now -- and a lot
             more when I get into that office.
             You can take that to the bank.

<b>THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS
</b>
Despite the shadows, it's plain the Man With The Hat is
in his prime, full of vigor and impatience. Calabrese,
by contrast, is clearly older, more circumspect.

<b>                          CALABRESE
</b>           Slowly ... slowly. Always with
           caution.

<b>                           SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
</b>           I'm up to here with caution! That
           fuck lives on bean curd and alfalfa
           sprouts -- he ain't gonna die of
           natural causes.

<b>                          CALABRESE
</b>           All I'm counseling is a little
           patience. The man is public. He's
           in the paper every day.

<b>                          SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
</b>           Yeah? Well, the next time I read
           about him, it better be in the
           obituaries.


<b>ON STORM
</b>
He squints over the camera, straining to see with the
naked eve Frustration


<b>ANGLE - CALABRESE AND VITALE
</b>
Glancing to each other. They're tough guys, but in some
hard-to-define way, the two Shadow Men are tougher.

<b>                          BAREHEADED SHADOW MAN
</b>           Enough bullshit. Can you do the
           job or not? If you can't -

<b>                          VITALE
</b>           We'll do it.


<b>STORM
</b>
Knowing he's on to something super hot.

<b>                          STORM
</b>                  (to himself,
                   soft but intense)

           shadows --

It's driving him crazy that he can't make out the Shadow
Men's faces. He peers around the wharf, looking for some
better vantage point.


<b>SHACK - CONSPIRATORS
</b>
keep talking.


<b>ANGLE - STORM
</b>
Darting closer, using the row of bulk containers for cover.
He takes up a new position, nearer the shack re-aims the
camera.


<b>LOOKOUT #1 (MIKEY)
</b>
hears something -- peers directly at the spot where Storm
is hiding.


<b>STORM
</b>
ducks quickly back out of sight. As he does this, his
earphone cord catches on something. yanking the phone
off Storm's head. He cannot hear what the conspirators
say next -- but the audience can.


<b>CONSPIRATORS
</b>
<b>                         SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
</b>          The job is a light plane ... a Lear
          P61. We want it to take off -- we
          don't want it to land.

Calabrese becomes aware of Mikey checking out the noise;
he motions the conspirators to shut up, then signals Mikey
to proceed. Mikey cocks his pistol, moves swiftly toward
the line of containers.


<b>SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
</b>
steps forward into the light. His face comes clearly
into view. Well dressed, magnetic, Bobby Kennedy-ish --
he is L.A. Assemblyman VERNON TRENT.

<b>STORM'S HIDING PLACE - MIKEY
</b>
steps around one container (out of view of the other men)
to the exact spot where Storm was. But Storm isn't there.
Mikey is about to check farther, when out of nowhere:

Storm lashes out with a savage punch to the face. The
blow is so devastating it knocks Mikey's feet out from
under him so that he topples face-forward into Storm's
arms, out cold. Storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to
the ground.

Storm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut. Kneeling
down to the outstretched heap, he finds the cause of his
injury -- one of Mikey's teeth wiggles freely in his
fingers. Storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the
big guy's hand.

<b>                         STORM
</b>                 (re: the fairy)
          A quarter's a quarter.

Calabrese and Vitale are getting uneasy.

<b>                         CALABRESE
</b>          Mikey! Quit playing with yourself
          back there.
                 (no response)
          Mikey --

Guns come out.   Calabrese and Vitale start this way --


<b>STORM
</b>
bolts back up the wharf, toward his car.


<b>CALABRESE AND VITALE
</b>
hurry up to their fallen comrade. They see Storm 50 yards
back up the pier, fleeing. Vitale takes off after him at
a dead run. At that instant:


<b>TRENT
</b>
moves INTO FRAME beside Calabrese. The Bareheaded Shadow
Man with him is Police Captain DAN HOLLAND (in civilian
business suit) -- 21 years on the force, hard as nails.

<b>CONSPIRATORS' POV
</b>
They see Vitale pull up, on foot, as Storm's CAR ROARS
OFF into the darkness. Vitale seems close enough to pick
out the license number.


<b>BACK TO TRENT
</b>
As his face moves into the light.     Merciless, implacable.

<b>                           TRENT
</b>                   (to Calabrese)
            Whoever that sonofabitch is, I don't
            want him to get an hour older.

<b>                           CALABRESE
</b>            He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.


<b>CALABRESE'S LIMO
</b>
speeds up beside the conspirators. Calabrese gets in,
the limo whips off down the wharf to pick up Vitale and
take off after Storm.


<b>TRENT AND HOLLAND
</b>
stand watching -- grim, furious.


<b>INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVES ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A burly plainclothesman, MAX DUNNE, waves his phone
receiver at Karl, Storm's partner, who's still at the
desk where we last saw him. A TV across the room tuned
to the ACADEMY AWARDS.

</b>
A crummy mini-mall around Torrance. Storm exits the phone
booth -- crosses toward a liquor store, which is still
open this late at night.


<b>INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
</b>
Storm enters. A grimy, high-crime booze store.    Not
exactly the place to find Mumm's '36.

Versace threads.

          Horror. Sex. Freaks. Violence.
          And I ain't gotta pay no four bucks.

Storm pulls a bottle from the cooler. He notices, on a
high shelf, a big stuffed toy. Something for Sonny.
Storm stretches up, grabs it. Suddenly:

He notices something in the big convex shoplifting mirror.
Something approaching from outside.

The Man hesitates, letting a few precious seconds pass.
Three Latino PUNKS enter the store. One of them carries
a long-barreled shotgun.

shoves them to the Shotgun Punk. The Punk scowls --

<b>                         COUNTER MAN
</b>          Where is a cop when you goddam need
          one?
                 (to Punks,
                  threatening)
          I got half a mind to come out there
          and teach you sonofabitch --

Shotgun Punk FIRES without warning -- point blank into
the counter display and the Man! The Counter Man is BLOWN
backwards -- cabinets crash; he crumples, groaning and
bloody onto the floor!

<b>                         SHOTGUN PUNK
</b>          Now you got half a mind, old man.

Punk #2 scoops up the money.   The three Punks saunter up
and surround Storm.

Storm looks down at their feet, then to their faces and
smiles. Shotgun Punk points the gun at Storm's face.

<b>                         SHOTGUN PUNK
</b>          What are you grinning at, pindejo?

The Punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him,
but it is too late for either option, as Storm suddenly
spins between the Punks and behind the gun.

The SHOTGUN GOES OFF and BLOWS away part of the back WALL --
BOTTLES EXPLODE -- Storm locks the Punk's fingers into
the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the Punk's
arm.

The others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun
and is using it as a sword or staff. He looks like a
true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation.
These pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in
his spontaneous orchestra.

Punk #2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife.
Storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot-
sweep the Punk. The Punk's legs fly skyward and his head
slams against the floor. As soon as he hits, the shotgun
is slammed through his teeth.

The last Punk has produced an icepick and is staring at
his compadres in disbelief. He and Storm square off.

<b>                         STORM
</b>                 (to Punk, calmly)
          I know what you're thinking.    I
          have this big shotgun and all   you
          have is that little icepick.    Mine's
          bigger than yours. It's not    fair.

Storm sets the gun down.    Punk #3 is still frozen.

<b>                            STORM
</b>          Still not fair?

Storm gets down on his knees.

<b>                         STORM
</b>          Don't wait for the blindfold,
          maricon.

                  ice pick tightly)
          Chinga tu madre!

The Punk lungs, thrusting the ice pick with lightning
speed at Storm's face.

Storm makes a slight movement, parries the thrust and
slides his body behind the Punk, simultaneously slamming
his forearm into the rear knee joint.

The Punk buckles and Storm now has one of his legs in
both arms and pins the other leg with his left knee.

We see the leg held in Storm's arms begin to twist ...
and with a blood-curdling scream we hear a LOUD SNAP.

SIRENS are heard approaching outside.


<b>EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
</b>
Black and whites pack the   parking lot. Police ambulances
make ready to haul off the   three Punks. T he Counter
Man, bandaged on a gurney,   is wheeled out by paramedics.
One medic catches Storm's   eye -- flashes a gesture
indicating the Counter Man   will be okay.

Storm finishes with two other DETECTIVES, obviously
buddies, as they complete their on-site notes. The
champagne bottle rests on the hood of their car.

<b>                         DETECTIVE #1

He grabs the champagne, takes off for his car.

Chuck Mangione's "Feels So Good" PLAYS in the TAPE DECK.
Storm listens for a few beats, as if letting the horn
cool him out after the liquor store action. Then he ejects
the tape decisively -- reaches into his camera case, pulls
out the surveillance tape from tonight. He punches this
tape into the deck.

Storm listens. The part where the Shadow Man with the
hat (Trent) says, "You'll be well compensated. Money now --
and more when I get into that office. You can take that
to the bank." Storm CRANKS UP the VOLUME.

the garage door remote.

Storm's car stops, headlights go out. The garage door
closes. Storm gets out, carrying his camera case,
champagne and the big stuffed toy. He takes a couple of
steps toward the door to the house, then stops, remembering -

He leans back into the car, yanks the surveillance tape
from the deck. Hands full, he tucks the tape into a inside
pocket of his Versace vest.

of the stairs, wearing panties and a teddy top. She smiles
seeing the big toy, shooshes Storm --

Storm stops outside his boy's room, looking in. Felicia
tiptoes up beside him. Sonny sprawls loose-limbed on the
bed in his Woody Woodpecker pajamas.

She tugs Storm sexily toward the bedroom --

Storm stops, toy in hand --

the stuffed toy sleepily, pulls it into bed beside him.

<b>                          SONNY

Storm knows E.T. is not just a movie character to Sonny;
he's a real person.

Storm moves closer to his son. He sees how much E.T.'s
loss has hurt his son, and wants to make it better.

          last.

Already Sonny is most of the way back to sleep.   Storm
kisses his forehead --


<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>INSERT - JOHNNY CARSON - 1982 "TONIGHT SHOW"
</b>
In mid-joke behind his famous desk.

Storm and Felicia forms obscure part of the screen --
standing close to each other, beside the bed. Felicia
helps him off with his jacket.

<b>                         FELICIA
</b>          There's blood on your jacket.

<b>                          STORM
</b>          It's okay.   It's not mine.

Storm's hands dump his stuff onto the bedside table --
camera, tapes from case, gun. He gathers the glasses,
pours champagne.

Felicia watches her husband. She plainly loves him deeply --
and is held and excited by his contradictions. They come
closer together, clinking their glasses, sipping.

<b>                         FELICIA
</b>          If people knew how sweet you are,
          they'd never be scared of you.

She kisses him seductively, unbuttoning his shirt at the
collar. Storm still wears the vest.

<b>                         FELICIA
</b>          I'm not scared of you.

<b>                         STORM
</b>          A couple of things crossed my mind,
          in the car coming home.

Another kiss. They get their glasses out of the way,
Storm lowers his wife languidly onto the bed. They begin
kissing more deeply. Storm helps Felicia slide out of
her teddy top; her beautiful breasts rise into the light.
Storm begins to kiss them, she moans with pleasure. The
lovemaking increases in intensity, Felicia's hand groping
to open Storm's pants. He begins to help her, guiding
her legs apart --

</b>                 (in mid-kiss)
          Door's open.

Not missing a beat, Storm grabs a heavy pillow, heaves it --
without looking -- at the door.

<b>ANGLE FROM HALLWAY - BEDROOM DOOR

The pillow strikes it, starting it swinging closed. Storm
and Felicia's forms, on the bed, are eclipsed. Sound
from the "CARSON SHOW" DROPS DOWN -


<b>INT. STORM'S HOUSE - ANOTHER HALLWAY - NIGHT

TWO MEN -- carrying shotguns, faces hidden by masks --
move soundlessly down a hall. A terrible alien presence
within this normal American household. The men turn a
corner into a different hallway --

movement out in the hall. But:

            What?

Storm lunges for his .45 on the nightstand. Suddenly
LOUD and VIOLENT CRASH and the bedroom door is kicked in.
Two dark figures with shotguns leveled fill the door.

There is an eruption of GUNFIRE and blinding muzzle blast
and smoke. In the dim light for a moment we do not know
what has happened, then:


<b>STORM'S POV
</b>
We see one of the assassins thrown backward, jacket blown
open at the shoulder.

<b>                                                SWITCH TO:
</b>

<b>ASSASSIN'S PARTNER'S POV
</b>
We see Storm hit badly at close range. He takes it in
the right center mass. It looks like his right arm is
torn off as his .45 is literally blown across the room.
Felicia is now hysterically screaming -- but not for long --
as she is mortally wounded. We are sure Storm will
collapse and this horror will be over, but Storm rushes
the remaining assailant, and tilting his body sideways as
he enters, he avoids one more ferocious BLAST.

The momentum of Storm's quick spin catches the assailant
perfectly, and like a fast spinning top slammed against
another, Storm has the puppet by the strings. He clamps
down with his left and only good hand on the assailant's
right hand, and uses it against the gun as a tool for
more torque. Spinning him around until he is at the peak
of his circle, Storm with all his might spins his whole
body in the opposite direction quickly, using the whipping
effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailant's
wrist and flip him violently.

There is a LOUD CRACK and   scream as he lands on his head
and neck, and then -- from   the side, point-blank --another
ferocious SHOTGUN BLAST --   Storm is blown into the air
and back onto the bed from   which he came.

<b>SLOW MOTION:

Down feathers   slowly float down toward the terribly sad
and lifeless   bodies of Storm and Felicia.  Holes pepper
walls; lamps   obliterated; beds and pillows not even a

smoke.

The two assassins recover themselves.    Bigger Man's
shoulder: limp and bloody.

They do. Big Man collects tapes and camera from the
bedside table, replacing them with large lumps of cocaine
and cash. Then lie coolly places something on the night
stand directly in front of the lifeless cop's face -- it
is a tooth.

Little Man rifles Storm's pockets, including the Versace
jacket beside the bed.

O'Malley tugs out a letter on official stationery.

</b>          We got two cops down, with money
          and drugs all over the place. This
          is straight from the commissioner.

Holland is clearly upset by this, but knows he can't argue
with a letter from the commissioner. Reluctantly he yields.
He turns his gaze back to the stretcher in the ER.

Now he and O'Malley are just two officers, sharing a loss.

<b>                         HOLLAND
</b>          You and Storm were tight, O'Malley.
          I'm sorry.

<b>                          HOLLAND
</b>          Well.

He got stopped tonight.

Holland breaks his stare at Storm's body and drags away,
signaling his own cops to vacate. They exit. No farewells
between Holland and O'Malley. O'Malley waits silently,
watching Holland and his men clear the corridor and
disappear.

O'Malley stares at Storm's body, stunned. The Doctor
stands beside him -- at the side of the room, away from
the medics.

           I almost missed it myself. But we
           have a pulse now. Your man is alive,
           Lieutenant.

O'Malley's eyes flash from Storm (over whom the medics
are now working) to the corridor outside, at the end of
which he can see several straggling cops and news people.
His mind is racing --

He spots something on a stainless steel medical table:
Storm's blood-soaked vest, apparently tossed there when
the medics stripped Storm to work on him. O'Malley picks
the vest up. He studies it -

PHHT!   Russ takes the SILENCED SHOT right between the
eyes.   His body collapses in a heap there in the entry.

Danny wheels Storm through the big swinging doors.
Suddenly -- he freezes.

He sees Russ's partial body in the doorway up the hall
recognizable because of its security uniform trousers.

reacts as if fearing Russ has had a heart attack. He
leaves Storm, rushes forward to investigate. Storm strains
to see.

PHHT!   PHHT!   Danny sprawls onto the floor, dead.


<b>INT. CLOSE ON STORM
</b>
Doesn't need to see to recognize that sound. He gropes
at once for the wall corner, trying to propel his litter
back through the swinging doors and out of sight.

Storm strains for it, his limbs maddeningly uncooperative
... stretching, pawing ... until -- he claws far enough
to reach where the janitor's mop rests against the wall.


<b>COMA WARD - HALLWAY - FORD
</b>
steps into the hallway, peering up and down -- just as
Storm slides out of view. The killer grabs Danny's body
by the ankles, to drag it back out of sight. Just then:


<b>ANDY
</b>
backs   through the double doors at the other end of the
hall,   trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies
she's   carrying. She and Ford are momentarily in full
view   of each other ... but backs turned. Suddenly --
Ford   hears Andy! He spins ... gun ready.

Andy carefully   heads   that way -- the two corpses visible
ahead and the   killer   poised to waste her. But she's
concentrating   on the   overloaded tray, traveling closer
... closer ...   until   -- she turns off into the medicine
room.

Ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight.


<b>AT ELEVATORS
</b>
Storm weakly, awkwardly "rows" himself toward the elevators
with the mop handle. Then using his hands, trying to
grasp the wall and push himself along.

He makes it within reach of the call button and stabs at
it with the mop handle. Misses. Again. Then: bull's-
eye! The light comes on!


<b>INT. COMA WARD
</b>
Ford has found the last (Storm's) medical chart -- and
the empty bed. He's heading back -- frustrated, angry
out toward the hall when... the elevator BELL DINGS.

Storm struggles to push himself inside. Everything an
excruciating effort. The doors slap into his litter,
trying to close. Reopen. Close. Reopen. Hindering him
as he throws a look toward --

stalks this way, ears tuned to the SLAPPING DOORS ahead
around the corner. He breaks into a trot --

nearing. The doors not yet closed and --

rounds the corner just as they shut.   Races forward --

Storm jabs at the panel for the lobby button -- but the
shaky mop handle hits 7TH FLOOR instead.

</b>          Sonofabitch!

<b>THIRD-FLOOR CORRIDOR - AT ELEVATORS

The killer hears this -- hears the ELEVATOR START UP. He
punches the call button. The other elevator opens. He
plunges in just as:

floor, hurries forward -- sees Russ and Danny's bodies!

She backs off in horror.

Andy rushes to the ward station, lunges for the phone --
finds it's been cut. Her view into the coma room suddenly
brings the realization that Storm's bed is still gone.


<b>STORM'S ELEVATOR
</b>
The doors open -- revealing   a dark, deserted seventh floor
still under construction.    He registers the opposing
elevator rising his way --   jabbing again at the control
panel ... exposed there ...   doors wide open.  Wild stabs.
Any button will do -- just   close the goddam door!

DING! Ford's ELEVATOR arrives. Doors open. We make out
the killer's form -- just as Storm's doors close.

Storm blows huge relief. Looks to see what he finally
pushed ... Shit! -- the 3RD FLOOR button. He puts the
mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all he's
got.  The gurney wheels around and places him right next
to the control panel. Storm twists onto his side and
slams a hand over the EMERGENCY STOP button. But the
button jams! And Storm's thrusting hand has pushed his
gurney even farther away! He can't reach it!

He feels the elevator about to stop at a floor ... claws
at the mop, as a weapon ... raises it with all his feeble
strength. The doors open and --

Andy crashes into him!

Andy hauls Storm's litter full tilt out   of the elevator.

snaking down the corridor. He stares in    astonishment at

She heaves the gurney, despite all its weight, past the
power cord, just as:

hurtles from the stairwell. In one beat, he takes in the
janitor; in the next, Andy and Storm -- down the hall.
Ford takes off after them. He's going to catch them!

flaring up, tripping Ford! He sprawls face-first as:

Andy blasts through the exit doors with Storm on the

Storm blinks his eyes   -- groggy, disoriented. He is in
bed, just waking up.    Outside his window: this postcard-
perfect ranch scene.    Has he died and gone to heaven? He
can barely absorb it:   nature, sunshine, life.

Storm peers around. He is alone in a pretty room, with
Western and Oriental furnishings. He's safe; someone has
apparently put him to bed, seen that he's comfortable.
He remembers: the nurse ... Andy.

A TV is on at the foot of the bed.     Storm squints at the
digital clock beside him: 4:17 PM.     Storm closes his eyes.

He struggles to sit. It takes all his strength simply to
get half-propped on pillows. Something jabs him. It's a
TV remote, on the sheet beside him. Storm picks it up.

After a beat, he manages to focus on the TV --

<b>TV SCREEN - "GERALDO SHOW" (FILE TAPE)

Heated argument in progress. Suddenly Roy Innis leaps
from his chair, starts strangling a white supremacist
across from him. Melee. The stage flooded with shooting,
fist-fighting men. Geraldo's nose is broken!

When Storm is turned away from the TV, a 10-second ad
comes on. Senator Trent waving and smiling to a crowd.

his hand on the PHONE hang-up bar.

will do. Then Storm starts to collapse.

He makes it upright, shaking, with a "See, I told you"
look.

He starts toward the kitchen. Andy looks very worried
but doesn't try to stop him. First step -- okay. Second --
okay. Third -- blam! The cane slips and he falls flat on
his face. Too weak to break the fall.


<b>LOW ANGLE - STORM

We see his face on the carpet and a mean desperate
conviction in these eyes not to fail and not to give up.
He struggles to rise -- it is pitiful. He's on his knees
growling with effort. Cane propped up, he manages to
somehow stand again. One step ... two steps ... three,
four ... he's absolutely exhausted. Boom! Falls flat
again.

Fury, frustration, despair --

exits the room and comes back momentarily with a bowl of
rice and begins to try to feed him. Of course he takes
the fork away and tries it himself, but by now his arms
are so fatigued from the previous strain that they shake,
his hand trembles and he misses his mouth -- getting the
rice all down his beard. Spilling a little too much to
ignore and at first it looks like he's going to explode.
He looks up at Andy, who looks so sad.

Storm breaks out laughing and so does Andy. They howl
together for a while and then settle down. Now Andy begins
to "help" feed Storm.

Andy enters, carrying a folder, and stares in surprise.
Storm has shaved and cut his hair. She obviously approves.
She watches for several moments as Storm, weak but on his
feet, holds on to the kitchen counter. He steps out, in
wobbly balance. Not too good at first, he tries again.

look at Andy, conscious of her look of sympathy.

He glances at them... at her ... and understands.

Storm slowly seats himself and begins to read.

<b>CLOSE ON TV SCREEN - JACK ESPOSITO
</b>
A well-known L.A. anchorman, Jack Esposito "whom we
glimpsed earlier in the mini-TV in the Armstead kitchen
scene), delivers the news.

A graphic behind him has a photo of Storm, captioned:
<b>"COMA COP. "

             -- This reporter was contacted
             personally by the now-infamous 'Coma
             Cop'... fugitive officer Mason Storm --
             who until days ago had languished
             in a seven-year coma.

             Storm gave me his word that he is
             innocent of all charges preferred
             against him in the press -- and
             that he has access to indisputable
             proof of this. Battling the atrophy
             caused by seven years of
             hospitalization, Storm is struggling
             even now to regain the strength
             that will enable him to come forward
             with this evidence. He has promised
             me and the K.A.B.C. audience a first
             look at his alleged proof.

<b>EXT. WESTWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

A WOMAN in a nurse's uniform comes INTO VIEW on the
sidewalk, trots up the steps toward the second floor of
the apartment building.

REVEALING that they are watching this from a parked car
from across the street. They get out, glance around
furtively --

The nurse is Martha -- Andy's friend from the hospital.
She holds a cat in her arms.

Clutching the cat, she strides for the door. Ford's foot
slides the door shut. He and Dunne block Martha.

<b>                         FORD
</b>          We'll ask you again, Martha:     Where

Martha backs away -- toward a telephone.

</b>          I'm calling your superior officers
          to report this. I want both your
          names and shield numbers.

She picks up the phone. Dunne's enormous hand engulfs
her wrist, forces her to put the phone back in the cradle.
The two cops stare at her penetratingly.

Martha knows this is it -- life or death.

She hurls the cat into Ford's face; the CAT claws him,
SHRIEKING. Martha knees Dunne in the balls, bolts --

Martha sprints from the door, toward the stairs, screaming.

<b>                           MARTHA
</b>          Help?   Help me!

Ford appears in the apartment doorway, his face scratched
and bleeding. He aims his silencer-mounted .45 --


<b>ANGLE - TOP OF STAIRS - MARTHA
</b>
The front of her white uniform erupts in a bloody gush;
she plunges face-first down the flight of stairs.


<b>ANGLE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS
</b>
Martha's crumpled form. Ford and Dunne hurry swiftly
down -- pick up her body, drag it a few feet to a
smackadjacent steep hillside covered with thick brush.
They peer around swiftly to be sure no one has seen them,
then slide the body under the brush, down the hill. In
three seconds it has slithered ten feet down, out of sight.

The killers take off.

<b>INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Storm has found a zabutone meditation pillow and is sitting
on his knees in formal Japanese posture with black Dugi
pants and no shirt. He unravels a package with Oriental
characters handwritten on the outside.

In one section: what looks like an old wax Baggie full
of Chinese herbs. In the other, Storm unfolds a pouch
containing an assortment of needles: long, short, skinny,
fat.

Storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder
with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks
it in deep. He then twirls and adjusts it.

It is apparent that he knows what he's doing. We STAY
CLOSE ON the needles, noting the amount in the package
has greatly diminished.

PULL UP to reveal Storm, with at least 50 needles sticking
out of him.

He is now frozen deep in meditation. CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND
him 360 DEGREES -- he is like a Japanese statue.

An impressive home facility with floor-to-ceiling mirrors,
Nautilus equipment, etc. Storm ignores the machines and
tentatively selects from an old set of weights, hefting
them to test his own strength, then begins a slow workout.


<b>B)    EXT. ARMSTEAD YARD - DAY
</b>
Storm performs a series of Eastern exercises: stick,
Aikido, and meditation. He's obviously pushing himself
beyond exhaustion; Andy watches, growing more and more
concerned.

Storm, dripping sweat, glowers at her for a long beat,
then... relents. She snatches the stick from his hand,
hauls him toward the house.

<b>                           ANDY
</b>            Jesus -- what a patient!


<b>C)    EXT. FIRE ROAD - DAY

Storm tries to run up a dirt hill. He's still too weak --
struggles, sweating, straining with fierce determination.


<b>D)    INT. ARMSTEAD - GYM - NIGHT
</b>
Storm at the "sticking point" in a Scott-bench  curl. His
biceps bulge, veins pop as he strains with all  his
strength. He ... can't ... quite -- then: he    Makes it!
Exhausted. Lets the bar crash metal-to-metal"'   into its

<b>E)    EXT. ARMSTEAD POOL - DAY
</b>
Storm swims, slowly gaining power.


<b>F)    EXT. WOODED CLEARING (ARMSTEAD'S) - DAY
</b>
Storm with two long pieces of cut oak. As Andy watches,
he lays them side-by-side on the ground and begins to dig
a deep narrow hole. He tests the hole for depth. When
it's deep enough, he places the boards down into the hole
and begins to fill it in, packing the earth tightly. He
goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a
length of old hemp rope. Around and around. The boards
stand up about six feet high. Storm steps back, observes
the height, taps it lightly testing the recoil tension.
Now he begins to punch it, harder and harder. Over and
over again. Andy, preparing his lunch, can't keep her
eyes off him. She is awed by his fire and perseverance.


<b>G)    EXT. ARMSTEAD POOL - DAY
</b>
Andy and Storm churn up the water in a splashy race. She
wins but not by much. She smiles. He doesn't. She
splashes water on him, but he's not in a playful mood.

Storm in frustration at the table.

Medical charts... a scribbled mess of medication dosages,
reading, etc

<b>                             ANDY

Andy on the wall phone, Storm listening on an extension.

<b>EXT. RETIREMENT HOME (REDONDO BEACH) - DAY

Andy gets out of her car in a sunny parking lot. She's
wearing dark glasses and a big floppy hat, so we can barely
see her face. She passes a sign: "REDONDO BEACH RETIREMENT
<b>VILLA."
</b>

<b>INT. RETIREMENT HOME - OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Andy sits across from the Old Lady from the phone call.
A plaque on the desk reads: "HENRIETTA WADE." Both she
and Andy look frustrated, irritated.

<b>CLOSET
</b>
Andy opens the door, reaches in for her jacket.   Suddenly
she pauses.

She sees on the closet shelf, amid other clothing:
policeman's cap with a gold shield.

Andy makes a decision -- finds a pad on a table, scrawls
a phone number. She holds out the paper.

<b>                         ANDY

</b>          Yes ... you're right.    I'm sorry.


<b>EXT. WOODED CLEARING - DAY
</b>
Storm again approaches the Makiwara.

This time it is almost as if no walls can contain him
nothing in his mind can represent a barrier. He has a
sense of total domination before he has begun.

He begins much harder and faster, continues driving his
fist deeper and faster and harder, until even those twelve
inches of solid oak are not enough for him.

With one lightning blow the OAK SPLINTERS and flies in
half. Storm walks away with a frightening calm -- stalks
straight inside toward the gym...


<b>INT. ARMSTEAD GYM - NIGHT
</b>
Storm has just finished a major aerobic workout and is
now doing some strange martial aerobic-type movements.
He is sweating profusely and is dressed in a tiny black
tank top and black sweat pants.

CAMERA PANS OVER TO a corner mirror and we see Andy peeking
through a crack in the door. She is enjoying this
immensely. She seems to be fighting her feelings, and
finally she puffs up her courage. Having made some
decision, she enters.

<b>                         ANDY
</b>          Oh, I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to
          interrupt. I, ah, well, I was just
          passing by and ...

They stare at each other in   quite a different way. This
time it's obvious what Andy   wants, and Storm probably
wants the same thing. But    he tries very hard to maintain
his "one objective" in life   -- to get very strong and win
the upcoming battle.

He looks at this woman who now 'Looks more beautiful than
anyone he has ever seen. Storm throws down the light
weights in his hands and walks up to her.

He gently grabs the back of her head and pulls her hair
back and kisses her on the mouth. She seems to explode
with passion as she falls to the floor, pulling him on
top of her.

They roll in passion growing stronger and stronger. The
CAMERA PANS TO the mirror and we see Andy's feet moving
in delight.

Alone, sitting up -- bare-chested, glistening with sweat
from the lovemaking. He glances across at his reflection
in the floor-to-ceiling mirror.


<b>MIRROR - STORM
</b>
Seeing himself, just after making love.    His wedding ring.


<b>ANDY
</b>
appears in the doorway, returning from the kitchen with a
tray and glasses. She wears a robe and has that mussed,
after-lovemaking glow.

She takes one look at Storm and her heart sinks.

She crosses to him -- lowers herself gracefully to kneel
beside him, setting down the tray and glasses.

shoulder ...

Storm pulls back.

He gets up, backing slowly away from her -- seeing the
pain in her eyes, feeling his own pain. In frustration,
he slams an elbow punch into a piece of gym equipment --
furiously venting rage! Andy flinches at the sound, the
violence.

For a second it look's like he's going to strike her.
Instead he kicks the tray and GLASSES -- which smashes
into the floor-to-ceiling MIRROR, SHATTERING like a bomb?

Andy glares at him, stalks for the door --


<b>EXT. APUMSTEAD DRIVE - IRON GATE - NIGHT
</b>
Andy's CAR ROARS out the dirt drive past the iron gate.


<b>INT. ARMSTEAD BEDRROM - NIGHT
</b>
Storm stalks in, slamming the door behind him -- crosses
in fury and despair to the desk. On the desktop: the
news photo of Felicia, Sonny and himself.

Storm stares at the photo in agony for a moment, then
rips the desk drawer open, rummages fiercely. He finds:
keys!


<b>INT. ARMSTEAD GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
Storm strides in, punches the garage door button; the
door starts to open. He grabs the corner of a dusty canvas
cover -- jerks it off an Army-style Jeep.

The Jeep speeds out into the night.

The Jeep parked at the edge of a cemetery road.

Ethnic neighborhood, Dodger Stadium visible in b.g.

Andy looks exhausted, from a night of black coffee and
anxiety. Now: frustrated by a BUSY SIGNAL.

No luck. Andy hangs up.


<b>EXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE STREET AND ALLEY - DAWN
</b>
Andy's car pulls past tiered hillside apartment units,
enters an alley behind a row of multi-family dwellings.

Andy at the wheel:   cautious, peering around.

She parks in an out-of-sight spot, TURNS OFF the ENGINE.

The emotion of the parting with Mason catches up with
her.

<b>                         ANDY
</b>          Get a hold of yourself, Andy.

She wipes her eyes, cranks the mirror around, tries to

Storm's Jeep enters the drive, pulls into the garage.
Storm SHUTS OFF the MOTOR. As he steps to the floor, a
man's silhouette MOVES INTO FRAME behind him.

Storm spins. For a second he is ready for anything.

Andy's car drives north, back to the Armstead house.

Ford in his car keeps a discreet distance back.


<b>ANGLE - FORD'S CAR
</b>
as another car carrying three men (including Jones, the
cop we remember who answered Andy's phone call from the
coma ward) pulls up alongside. Ford points ahead, toward
Andy's car. The new car slips in behind Ford's, tailing
Andy.


<b>INT. ARMSTEAD LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Coffee table piled with the news clippings Storm has been
studying these past days.

<b>                         O'MALLEY
</b>          -- That night in the hospital, I
          found the audiotape ... in your
          vest. I must've listened to it a
          thousand times -- looking for little
          quirks in the voices, phrases they
          repeat ...

His look shows he came up with nothing.

<b>                         STORM
</b>          Where is the tape?

<b>                         O'MALLEY
</b>          I turned it in for evidence.

Storm scowls.

<b>                         0'MALLEY
</b>          Don't worry, I made a duve. I'll
          get it for you. Meanwhile maybe
          this'll cheer you up.

From O'Malley's briefcase comes .45 automatic, three empty
clips and a box of Glazer ammo.

Storm takes the weapon with pleasure. Checks the action,
hefts it for weight. He glances at O'Malley -- two old
comrades, ready to get back in action. Suddenly a bit of
sadness crosses Storm's face.

<b>                         STORM
</b>          What happened, O'Mal?    To you?

O'Malley begins loading the clips: grim, almost
heartbroken.

</b>          I was on the case, trying to find
          who pulled the trigger on you. But
          it was like swimming through shit.
          People kept telling me to back off.
          Then one morning, the phone rings.
          Immaculate Heart Emergency: someone
          ran my mother off the road, her
          back's broken, she's paralyzed.

          I'm sorry, O'Mal.

<b>                         O'MALLEY
</b>          That night there's a note in my
          locker -- letting me know it's not
          an accident.

He looks at Storm, tormented.

<b>                         O'MALLEY
</b>          You know me, Storm. I never would've
          backed off. But there was Sonny to
          worry about too. What if they found
          him? What if they found you?

<b>                         STORM
</b>          You did the right thing, O'Mal.

Storm takes a loaded clip from his friend, slams it into
the butt of the .45. He jacks the slide back and lets it
slam home -- chambering a round.

<b>                         STORM
</b>          We'll get 'em, buddy. Every fucking
          one of them.

</b>          Get Sonny out of that school, O'Mal.
          Right now. With me alive and making
          a stink, whoever's on that film is
          going to be looking harder than
          ever for Sonny -- just to get to
          me. Get him someplace safe ...

Storm poised inside the front door -- .45 in hand.   In
walks ... Andy!

She nearly faints at the sight of the pistol leveled
between her eyes. Storm instantly jerks the weapon back.
They stand there staring at each other.

<b>                           ANDY
</b>          Martha's dead.

Storm takes Andy in his arms. She weeps, sobbing. Feeling
all the tension and terror of the past days -- yet somehow
knowing she's safe in the arms of this man she loves.

<b>                         ANDY

Andy raises her face to Storm's, her eyes welling with

frosted-glass top-half. Suddenly:

The TOP of the FRONT DOOR EXPLODES inward in a SHOWER of
flying GLASS! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Three more point-blank
SHOTOGUN BLASTS BLOW the rest of the DOOR to hell.


<b>ANGLE - HALLWAY
</b>
Storm hurls Andy so hard and fast it looks like she will
land in pieces. He somehow ends up in front of her on
the floor as a masked man plunges through the front door
into the hallway, shotgun spinning to cover his advance.
Too late.

We hear TWO LOUD ROUNDS and the masked man's head snaps
violently back and he falls into a pile.


<b>EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Jones and   Ford pull masks over their faces and sprint for
the other   doors. Both carry assault rifles. An enormous
powerful   third man (Joe Bear), his mask already in place,
vaults to   low balcony, hauls himself up to a second story
window --   his huge Bowie knife glinting in the sun.

them -- on the first floor.


<b>INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - INTERIOR BALCONY

Joe Bear waits concealed at  the top of the stairs, on an
interior balcony overlooking  the living room, atrium-style.
Through the mouth opening of  his ski mask, we see he is
smiling a sick smile -- and  sensually stroking his Bowie
knife.


<b>ANGLE - TRACKING - STORM
</b>
Storm and Andy scramble up the staircase onto the atrium
balcony and out steps Joe Bear with his knife and his
smile.

Joe Bear, for the first time in his life, is surprised
when Storm smiles too. Joe Bear screams like an animal
and lunges with his knife.

Storm stabs out his left arm like a spear and tilts his
body ever so slightly, then clamps Joe Bear's wrist with
his right hand.

Allowing his tremendous momentum to culminate like a
hurricane, Storm manipulates him in a full circle,
catapulting Joe Bear unbelievably into a tall T'ang Dynasty
cabinet filled with priceless Oriental artifacts!


<b>LIVING ROOM
</b>
Ford and Jones, masked, hurtle into the living room, just
below the atrium balcony. They raise their automatic
weapons, but before they can fire --


<b>STORM
</b>
hurls Joe Bear's massive body down upon the attackers!
Jones takes the tonnage head-on and is crushed beneath
it! Ford dodges, unleashes a burst of AUTOMATIC FIRE
straight up at the balcony. Storm shoves Andy to safety
onto the exterior balcony and dives there himself, just
as the whole interior balcony is RIDDLED by Ford's BULLETS!

Ford bolts for the staircase, coming after Storm. Storm,
crouched around the corner on the exterior balcony, waits
till Ford hurtles INTO VIEW at the top of the staircase.
Storm FIRES his .45 furiously ... Ford springs back,
Storm's BULLETS BLAST the staircase WALL to ribbons. His
.45 CLICKS empty!

rips a magazine from his pocket, slams it into the butt
of his .45, reloading. He has it half-raised when:

Ford appears -- right in his face, assault rifle leveled
at Storm's guts. Storm strikes an instantaneous blow,
sending the rifle flying. In one motion, he pinwheels
Ford over his head, sending him flying off the exterior
balcony and crashing down into the Oriental fountain below!


<b>EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - BALCONY AND FOUNTAIN

Storm swings down to the ground. Andy leaps into his
arms, he breaks her fall and helps her alight safely.

He reaches to Ford in the fountain, rips the mask off his
face.

He recognizes the man.

<b>TWO MORE MASKED MEN
</b>
appear running down the drive -- SHOTGUN and assault RIFLE
trained on Storm and Andy. They begin to FIRE.

Andy can't shoot and Storm can't drive and shoot at the
same time, so he does what is logical for him -- he keeps
the pedal to the metal and chases them.

BULLETS from the two men OBLITERATE the Jeep's WINDSHIELD.
BUCKSHOT RIDDLES the VEHICLE everywhere. Andy is on the
floor of the Jeep. Storm is periodically ducking. He is
bleeding we don't know from what or how bad -- and then
blam! -- masked man #1's body is airborne. This makes #2
think... and run very fast.


<b>EXT. TEAHOUSE - DAY
</b>
He is sprinting the 100 in 5 flat -- racing for the tea
house. He makes it inside and dives for a good position
to resume firing, but there isn't enough time. Storm
just drives right through the front of the tea house and
over the assassin's body! The JEEP ROARS out of the
flattened tea house and keeps on hauling!

ROARS across the terrain... past the horses, ostriches,

</b><b>LENS - SONNY STORM - (SLOW MOTION) - DAY
</b>
Our first live look at Storm's son as a twelve-year-old.
Wearing colorful soccer duds and TRINITY PREP athletic
shirt. He looks terrific, like a young colt -- free and
fearless -- his shiny hair flying as lie runs down a soccer
ball in the pell-mell action of an eighth-grade game.

The feel of this SLOW MOTION portrait is diametrically
opposite to the corruption and duplicity in the world of
the movie so far. In contrast, Sonny's world seems pure
and unsullied -- youthful and untouched by the harsh
realities of the world. We watch Sonny and his teammates
long enough to absorb his vigorous,full-of-life energy.

game -- scrambles to his feet, legs churning to take off
in pursuit of his friends. Just as he gets his traction:

Sonny cries out and tries to resist, but --

Storm is reacting to the sight of his old home -- the
first time he's seen it since the slaughter seven years
ago. He struggles with his pain and rage.

Andy, aware of his turmoil, takes his hand. Her hair is
done up in a businesslike style; she wears a jacket and
carries a briefcase. They cross to the front door --


<b>INT. STORM'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY
</b>
A pleasant, chatty (and very pregnant) HOUSEWIFE speaks
through the open door to Storm and Andy. Sounds of

Two plasterers troop past, a carpenter with them.

</b>          Hell, come on in. Everyone else
          does.

Storm and Andy enter. Andy immediately begins to steer
the Housewife away from the kitchen, into the living room.
"Oh what a cute place!

I'd love to see what you're doing with the nursery..."


<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Storm casually lingers behind, drifting into the kitchen.
He crosses immediately to the alcove where, seven years
earlier, he stashed the camera case.

But the spot has been remodeled!   There's a new wall there!

<b>                         STORM
</b>          New wall ... fucking yuppies!

Without hesitation, he slams his fist through --


<b>WALL
</b>
Bang! Gypsum wallboard splinters, revealing a fake panel
of brick adjacent to a real brick wall, six inches behind
the new wallboard. Storm reaches into the hole, yanks
out the camera case. He shakes his sore knuckles from
the blow as:


<b>HOUSEWIFE AND ANDY
</b>
arrive from the living room. The Housewife stares in
shock at this strange man -- with his hand halfway through
her new wall.

          Better have this place fumigated --
          quick.

He leads Andy out -- crisply, businesslike.    Housewife
stands there dumbfounded.


<b>ACROSS FROM CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY
</b>
Storm pauses in mid-conversation, drops the phone receiver
from his ear. Thinking fast, troubled. Andy beside him...
both of them keeping their faces obscured as moviegoers
and business people pass.

          three hours ago -- with the tape.
          He should be at the school by now,
          but she hasn't heard back from him.

Several people pass, glancing curiously at Storm. He
averts his face, getting even more antsy. The camera case
under his arm.

          a nervous breakdown.

Storm knows this, too -- puts the receiver back to his
ear.

WITH SCORE.    Tension, urgency increasing --

</b>
Mrs. O'Malley hangs up her phone, finishes scribbling the
notes she took from Storm. CAMERA MOVES IN ON the office
window. THROUGH the window, outside DOWN the block, we
see ... a nondescript sedan --

Two men inside. One wears earphones. He takes them off --

O'Malley hurrying from his car in the lot toward the

looking LATINO YOUTHS in a ragged Camaro. The dudes check
Andy out lasciviously.

<b>                              STORM
</b>            Hey, hermano!     You want this Jeep?

He pulls the keys from the ignition, holds them up.

<b>                              YOUTH #1

<b>                           STORM

The youths look to each other. Then to the piece of shit
they're driving. In their heads, they've already got the
Jeep stripped, repainted, etc.

<b>                           YOUTH #1

The TV reporter we remember from earlier in the film, the

Suddenly Storm slows --

as Max Dunne moves INTO FRAME seizing Esposito -- subtly,
not drawing any attention. Another man in a suit
reinforces Dunne from the other side. Esposito shows
terror, but no surprise. Clearly the men have had the
drop on him for several minutes -- but there was nothing
he could do about it. Dunne's posture indicates he has a
concealed gun pressed to Esposito's ribs.

Dunne and Storm make eye contact.    The message is clear:
Try anything and Esposito dies.

concealing a short-barreled automatic weapon.

<b>                         SECURITY-TYPE

The man gestures with his coat arm.   Storm's eyes follow
to:

The Senator himself. Big, as life and cool as a cucumber.
Alone and unrecognized on a bench, shelling and munching
from a bag of peanuts. Behind him: a caged vulture.

He waits till they're out of sight, then swiftly mounts a
tall equipment box that reaches almost to the ceiling.
He shoves a few boxes out of his way, revealing --

in the mesh ceiling of the room. Sonny flops onto his
back atop the tall equipment box, kicks up hard -- the
hatch pops open!

climbs out onto the "roof" of the room. He sees a short
catwalk leading to the huge, high wall of the dynamo room.
Against the wall are big windows.

Sonny scoots to the windows, which are cracked open awning

A cab pulls into the curb outside Mrs. O'Malley's place,
Sonny springs out. We see the cabbie shouting after him --
and Sonny arguing, gesturing toward the nursing home.

Mrs. O'Malley emerges from the nursing home wheelchair.
Sonny rushes to her ... they embrace joyfully.

O'Malley comes out too, more cautiously than his mother.
He is armed. He also hurries to Sonny, hugs him tight.

Still hugging Sonny, O'Malley shoves a bill at the cabbie.
Whatever it is, the cabbie is thrilled. He boogies off
ecstatically.

his eyes flash across the lobby. He spots:

in front of his face and uses him as a human battering
ram for him and Andy to escape, plunging the man through
two layers of glass windows of the adjoining Hertz rental

Andy follows through the newly formed exit. People scream.
Chaos. The other cops react in pursuit of Storm and Andy.

decorative fountain that separates the Avenue of the Stars.
But almost equally as fast, two cop cars start to close
in on him. It looks like Storm is trapped! But he slams
the pedal to the metal and blasts between them, escaping.

</b>
0'Malley scans the monitor above the ticket seller's
window. The 11:10 to Albuquerque leaves on track 12.

The waiting area is quiet at this time of night except
for a few travelers and stragglers.

Sonny Storm, quiet and apprehensive, focuses on tearing
open the packet of mustard for his hot dog. He sits on
top of a battered suitcase.

O'Malley returns with the tickets and sits next to Sonny
on a bench.

</b>          I think I'm more nervous than you

</b>          Soon...

Just then, O'Malley becomes aware of a bad vibe in the
air. A foreign presence. Nolan, and Turner have followed
him and Sonny from Mrs. O'Malley's house. Now they
approach --

          Hey, O'Malley! Long time no see.
                 (approaching)
          Taking a trip somewhere?

O'Malley slip the tape from his pocket, placing it under
Sonny's Jacket on the bench without missing a beat, as he
calmly starts to rise.

They both laugh.

<b>                         TURNER
</b>          Looks a lot like Mason Storm.

O'Malley and the men come to face-off point, staring at
each other.

<b>                         NOLAN
</b>          Enough of this fucking around.    We
          want the tape.

CLUNK! O.S. we hear a CLATTERING ECHO.

Sonny has picked up his jacket.   The tape has fallen onto
the marble floor!

<b>                          O'MALLEY
</b>          Sonny -- run!

Sonny snatches up the tape and leaps over the bench, racing
toward the rear doorway heading for the street.

Nolan and Turner start to run after him. O'Malley throws
a fierce body block on both men, sending all three crashing
into a big, loaded luggage cart. O'Malley finds his feet
first as all three struggle to get up. Nolan starts to
pull his gun. O'Malley grabs a heavy metallic suitcase
and smashes Nolan in the face with all his strength.
Nolan crashes backward against Turner, toppling them both
into a huge 25-foot lighting installer's ladder -- which
now starts -- to cave over, pulling a string of dozens of
big industrial GLOBES plummeting to the floor and EXPLODING
into thousands of tiny shards! People scream. O'Malley
shoves the luggage cart at the men and races for the door --

Sonny has made his way into the parking area, amidst dozens
of cars, but he has stopped -- looking back fearfully,
worried about O'Malley. O'Malley bursts from the exit.

In front of the station, a cab is jacked up; the driver
replacing a flat. O'Malley starts to run toward Sonny
past the cab, when suddenly:

He is SHOT in the back by Nolan! His lurching bulk crashes
into cab, knocking it off its jack to the ground. The
tire iron (that's used as a jack handle) springs loose,
onto the ground near O'Malley.

Seeing the gunmen, Sonny in horror crawls under a car.

The cab driver flees for  his life. O'Malley      spins back,
draws and tries to fire  at the oncoming Nolan     and Turner --
but he is SHOT TWICE in  the stomach. Turner      kicks O'Malley
in the hand, sending the  gun flying off under     the cab!

<b>                            NOLAN
</b>          Get the kid!     He's under the cars!

Nolan and Turner sprint off after Sonny.    Sonny rolls
from under one to another.

Nolan and Turner try to trap him, peering under the cars --
but Sonny is too agile and cat-like. Turner crouches down,
spots Sonny.

<b>                         TURNER
</b>          Give us the tape, kid -- and we'll
          take you home.

Turner aims his gun.   Suddenly:

His head turns to squash as: a bloody O'Malley stands
over him, bashing him with a tire iron!

A crowd of bystanders scream in horror at this horrendous
sight.

Nolan comes around the end of the car, sees O'Malley --
standing over the dead Turner with a tire iron in his
hand. It is clear  O'Malley is about to die. But still
he staggers toward Nolan, raising the tire iron.

Nolan, gun in hand, watches incredulously. O'Malley
staggers another step. Sonny has crawled out from under
the car; he sees this. O'Malley staggers another step.

           with his last failing strength,
           O'Malley raises the tire iron.
           Nolan PUMPS him once, square in the
           chest, killing him.

Sonny screams and flees in fear for his life. Nolan races
after him. Between the maze of parked cars. Sonny,
dodging, in between the endless rows.

Meanwhile a small crowd has gathered around the mortally
wounded O'Malley.

Suddenly, O.S. we hear the SCREECHING of TIRES. The crowd
reacts as the Gullwing blasts into the lot, ROARING
straight toward Nolan and the terrorized Sonny. Finally,
unable to get any closer, Storm leaps out of the Gullwing,
onto the hood of a car and races across the rooftops of
one vehicle after another, closing in on Nolan and Sonny.

Andy stops in horror beside the deathly stricken O'Malley.

Holland grabs his shoulder holster off the back of a chair,
stalks angrily toward a rear door.

The others glower as Holland pounds off into the rear of
the house. Dunne slings a cue ball the length of the
table, breaking the rack with a crack like a pistol shot.

The balls ricochet into each other and the cushions in a
futile expression of rage and frustration. Suddenly:


<b>STORM
</b>
Out of nowhere appears at the door opposite the one Holland
just left by.  He is dripping from the rain and has a .45
pointed at them with one hand, while with the other he
holds a finger to his lips as if to say, "Shhh, don't
wake the baby."


<b>DUNNE, FORD AND JONES

don't know whether to shit or go blind.

Glances from the men toward the couch at the rear of the
room, on which rest their jackets and shoulder holsters.
Storm: totally aware of every aspect of the situation.

<b>                          STORM

There is a brief moment of hesitation and a look of
disbelief between the boys and then, BOOM! Ford tries to
hand Storm a pool cue as if Storm's head is a baseball
and the cue is a bat. This doesn't work very well, as
Storm enters and simultaneously grabs Ford's cue, using
his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the
pool table. We hear Ford's SKULL CRACK and he goes down.

Almost instantly another pool cue in Jones's hands slashes
toward Storm's head. This time Storm has his own tool --
and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect
with his head.

He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as
soon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back
of Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAP
at the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm is
left with the jagged tip of the skinny end.

Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch
at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher
knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table.
Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's
midsection. With the other hand he  raises the sharpened
end of the pool stick and slams it down Dunne's throat
via the windpipe!

<b>                         STORM
</b>          That's for my wife. Fuck you and
          die.

Dunne falls to his knees and just stares. Storm does a
flying kick to his chin, breaking his neck. The room now
finished, he turns and exits.


<b>INDOOR POOL
</b>
Holland pours himself a nervous drink. He paces, tracking
Trent who's doing a gentle breaststroke.

<b>                         TRENT
</b>          I want Dunne and the others here.
          That goddamn Storm is nuts enough
          to come after me --

<b>                         HOLLAND
</b>          He's nuts -- but not that nuts.

Holland watches Trent swim a few more strokes, then turns
and heads away down a short hallway.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - HOLLAND
</b>
as he lifts the toilet seat to pee, he finds a handwritten
note on the seat. Shocked, he nervously looks around.
Seeing nothing, he picks up the note and reads it.


<b>INSERT - NOTE
</b>
Anticipation of death is worse than death itself.


<b>HOLLAND
</b>
A faint smile comes to his face with great confidence.
As he backs out of the toilet, he pulls his pistol from
his shoulder holster, cocking it. He cautiously exits.


<b>TRACKING
</b>
Holland as he   moves toward the sporting room   and his
support team.    He enters the area of carnage   and the smug
confidence on   his face starts to change to a   slight worry.
He then starts   carefully making his way back   to the indoor
pool to inform   Trent.


<b>INDOOR POOL
</b>
Holland enters the area and finds no one.     Now the look
on his face is one of fear and confusion.

<b>                           HOLLAND
</b>           Sonofabitch.

But he has a plan. His plan is to try to make it out of
the house in one piece. What was once careful stalking
has turned into panicked blundering.

CONTINUE TRACKING Holland as he bumps into things, knocking
them over, retreating wildly. He passes a raging fireplace
and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice:

<b>                          STORM (O.S.)
</b>           How does it feel to know you're
           about to die?

Holland FIRES in the direction of the voice, and Storm
comes out of the shadows standing in plain view -- his
.45 pointed at Holland.

<b>                          STORM
</b>           I'll give you more time than you
           and Trent gave my wife.

Holland changes the point of his aim and FIRES again.    As
he fires, Storm EMPTIES his GUN straight at Holland.


<b>WALL BEHIND HOLLAND
</b>
A Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group
of holes has just appeared, two inches above Holland's
head. They are both out of ammo.


<b>STORM'S POV
</b>
Holland picks up a fireplace poker. He's swinging like
maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the
<b>AIR.
</b>
But he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker
away from him.

They are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Holland
gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING.

Storm then begins the search for Trent. He casually
strolls through the house calling as if he's playing hide
and seek with a childhood friend.

<b>                         STORM
</b>          Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are
          you?

Storm opens closets, looks in drawers, under the toilet
seat, and then proceeds into --


<b>INT. MASTER BEDROOM
</b>
<b>                          STORM
</b>                  (loud enough
                   for Trent to
                   hear)
          Let's see ... where could that bad
          boy be?

From the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a
kiddie game, we are not sure if: Storm has gone mad or
what. He approaches the master closet as he continues
the taunting melody.


<b>MASTER CLOSET
</b>
Storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks
aside -- looking for something that's probably not there.
Trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a
jet to the Bahamas by now.
<b>
</b>  Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             99.



One more rack of clothes in the farthest-back section.
Storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and
deafening suddenness: a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank
... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely
missing Storm's head. Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm
gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen
eye to eye.


<b>STORM AND TRENT
</b>
Storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then
violently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his
chest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off
shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight
into Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the
teeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his
mind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head.

Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through
the house, shotgun still in his mouth.

<b>                         STORM
</b>          You know, Trent, I want to kill you
          so bad I can barely contain myself.
          But I keep thinking that death is
          far too merciful a fate for you,
          and that a nice petite white-bread
          boy like you in a federal
          penitentiary ...
                 (pause)
          -- let me put it this way -- I doubt
          whether you could remain anal
          retentive for very long. Yeah... I
          think that's best for you --

Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about
to go out of his mind. About this time in their journey
through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's
mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared
before, you should see him now.

Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to
pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last
chance.

Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth
impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes
flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps
inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent
and flips him backwards head-first into the fire.

Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron
arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to
free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ...
a fate somewhat worse than prison.

Storm turns away --

<b>                                                FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b>

<b>EXT. CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY
</b>
We are not sure where we are yet. In   the distance, we
see a procession of marching men, all  wearing kilts, and
all the accoutrements of traditional  Scottish garb. In
the front, several paces ahead of the  neatly marching
lines of men, is a single BAGPIPER.   Behind all of them
is a hearse, being nobly escorted by  mounted police.


<b>FULL SHOT
</b>
Now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion
of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen
comrade.

CAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly
police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER
and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full
police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. Andy
and Sonny are standing near at sober attention.

The procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to
play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a
section of lawn. The pallbearers remove the flag from
the casket and present it to the Chief of Police, who now
slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly
in front of Sonny Storm. He presents the flag and salutes
Sonny. The lone bagpiper stops and an officer on TRUMPET
begins playing "Taps." The coffin is slowly lowered.


<b>FULL SCREEN - TV MONITOR
</b>
Finally: the film that Storm shot that night seven years
ago on the wharf. Spliced with the audiotape -- with
subtitles including each speaker's name to make every
word and identity clear. We see:

The two Shadow Men step from the station wagon. The
"pushed" film clearly reveals them to be Trent and Holland.
We see them conspire with Calabrese and Vitale.

<b>                          TRENT (V.O.)
</b>           I'm up to here with caution! This
           (bleep) lives on alfalfa sprouts
           and bean curd, he ain't gonna die
           of natural cause.

Our SHOT starts to WIDEN, revealing that the TV monitor
is in a news studio. The nightly news is being broadcast:
what we see on this monitor is simultaneously going out
over the air.

As the SHOT WIDENS and TRAVERSES, we begin to see the
actual news set -- including Esposito who got his well-
deserved scoop -- and other anchorpeople, crewmen, etc.

<b>                          CALABRESE (V.O.)
</b>           All I'm counseling is a little
           patience. The man is public. He's
           in the paper every day.

<b>                          TRENT (V.O.)
</b>           Yeah? Well, the next time I read
           about him, it better be in the
           obituaries.

CONTINUE MOVE as the wharf scene keeps playing. The TV
monitor passes OUT OF FRAME, SOUND goes DOWN, we're MOVING
PAST the news set and its occupants (who are readying to
go back on-camera as soon as the wharf tape ends) and on
<b>UP TOWARD --
</b>

<b>LIGHTS ABOVE NEWS SET
</b>
which now FILL the FRAME -- bright and blinding. The
screen starts to bleach out ... it goes white and


<b>MATCH CUT - SUN (MARINA DEL REY)
</b>
above a perfect peaceful sea. A small powerboat (the
kind that you rent from the dock) moves INTO FRAME. Storm
steers it, standing up. Andy and Sonny in the back cockpit
seat.


<b>IN ANDY'S LAP - PORTABLE TV
</b>
She switches a channel: up comes the same footage we just
saw on the news set.


<b>ANDY
</b>
It takes a beat before she realizes what it is. Then:

<b>                          ANDY
</b>           Hey ... Seven year Storm!
                  (indicates TV)
           I told you you'd be famous.

Storm takes a step so he can see the screen.   Views it
for a short beat, then --


<b>STORM
</b>
picks the TV up from Andy's lap and, while it's still
playing, heaves it over the side and into the drink!


<b>OCEAN SURFACE - TV
</b>
splashes ... bobs for a few moments... then sinks beneath
the surface.

<b>                           ANDY
</b>                   (laughing)
           Hey!   Why'd you do that?


<b>STORM
</b>
watching the last ripples from the sinking set. A moment
between him and himself -- when the past is allowed to
slip away, sink out of sight, making way for the future.

Storm turns back from the water surface, to his son and
to the woman he loves. He sits (letting the boat drift
wherever it wants to) and tugs Andy down beside him.

Then he reaches across to his son, pulls the boy to him
with a playful headlock.

For a moment both Andy and Sonny are held in suspension,
wondering what Storm will do or say.

Finally:

<b>                          STORM
</b>                  (to Sonny)
           Knock, knock.

For a beat, the boy is taken aback.    Then he break's into
a broad smile.

<b>                           SONNY
</b>           Who's there?

Storm glances to Andy, pulling her tighter to him.

</b>          You don't have to cry about it.
                 (a beat, then)
          I love you both.

Storm hugs his son with great affection, pulling Andy to
him with his other arm. This is their beginning.


<b>BOAT
</b>
drifts its happy way across the sun-shimmering sea.
