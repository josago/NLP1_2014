          EYES. Expressive, alive. Human?
           No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES.

<b>          EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY
</b>
          She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,
          a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A

<b>          SHOOTING STAR.
</b>          Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF
          CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.

<b>          EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY
</b>
          A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.
          They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.
          As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving
          quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.

<b>          EXT. CANOPY - DAY
</b>
          Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
          He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
          ignites the community - but too late.
          POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
          dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
          Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
          teeth and sends her off.
          Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
          around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
          MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
          an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
          Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
          CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER

<b>          FROM HIS MOUNT.
</b>          Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
          rally a counter-attack.
          But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
          the defense. It's chaos.
          SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
          one. Others take off.

          net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...

<b>          A SHOT RINGS OUT.

          Caesar studies the harness that's keeping him in the swing.
          There's a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back. He
          undoes the one on his right side. CLICK. Then the left

          stopped playing to stare at him.
          Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and
          tosses it to Todd's Buddy. The Boy catches it, throws it
          back to Caesar.

          Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile.
          Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her

          "MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in
          Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd,
          stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils.
          Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.
          Alice runs inside.

          TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.
          The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this

          Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is

          Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong
          turn as he leads Caesar to the car.
          They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.
          Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches
          of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One
          CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE

<b>          LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.

          Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.
          Neither makes a sound.

          higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO

          Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS
          walk home from school.
          One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to
          her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl
          smiles, flirts back.
          One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.
          The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.
          Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with
          these teens. He wants to be one of them.

          Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S

          Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.

          apprehension. Caesar doesn't belong here. It takes every
          bit of restraint he has not to take Caesar out, to run...

          Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this
          doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.

          Time has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon.
          Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the
          cage, heavy head resting on his arms.
          He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,
          followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.
          In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR

<b>          CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD
</b>
<b>          ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.
</b>          This is ROCKET.
          He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage
          floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL.
          He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a
          challenging eye to Caesar.

<b>          SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!

<b>          DODGE (O.S.)

          Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.
          Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to
          cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in
          an occasional rotted vegetable.
          The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
          food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-
          looking dog food.

          IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney
          looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.

          Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his
          back as a shield.
          The water BLAST is relentless.
          Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
          long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the

<b>                         (INTERRUPTING)

          A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the
          effect Will was after.

<b>                         WILL (CONT'D)

<b>                         JACOBS
</b>          You're out of your mind.
          Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit
          there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious.

<b>                         WILL

          Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.

<b>                         WILL

          It's the payday you've been waiting

</b>
          Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.
          He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages
          are empty - that his cage door is open.
          Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.

<b>          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING
</b>
          Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet
          floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.
          He can HEAR the APES in the distance.
          Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He
          pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.

<b>          EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING
</b>
           Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to
          the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE

<b>                         BRIDGE:
</b>          THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.
          And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,
          BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT
          THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on
          toward the atrium.
          The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.
          Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around
          the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,
          orangutans with orangutans.
          They haven't noticed him yet.

<b>          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY
</b>
          Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take
          notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED

<b>          LIKE A HUMAN.
</b>
<b>          HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN

</b>
<b>          MORE UPRIGHT...

</b>          He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes
          follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.
           Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the
          ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then
          tosses it to Rocket.
          Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
          trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.

<b>          AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET
</b>
<b>          SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.
</b>          Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches
          out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the
          material. Caesar jerks his arm away.
          Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.
          Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can
          make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.
          Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws
          Caesar to the ground, pinning him.
          Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket
          across the face.
          OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts
          POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're
          coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.
          Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.
          Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs
          at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.
          He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's
          face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...

<b>          .ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.
</b>          BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.
          Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S
          BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He
          pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.
          Caesar starts to move off -

<b>          INT. RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY
</b>
          Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED.
          His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants,
          now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,

<b>          PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.
</b>          It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.
          Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,
          restrained to a medical table.
          Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.

<b>                         VOICE

<b>                         STEWART (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't understand.
          Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW

          Empty canisters labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
          REVEAL WILL in the doorway, watching it all very carefully.

<b>                         VIRUS TECHNICIAN

          A repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up
          and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the
          orangutans sleep.
          ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck,
          windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in
          his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed.
          40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney.

          Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing
          ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move
          across the bridge.
          On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE,
          ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out,
          then moves off to join the others.
          Caesar maneuvers to get a better view.
          Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him
          push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his
          arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS

<b>          HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE.
</b>          Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE.
          Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still
          alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable.
          Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out?
          Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S

          Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar
          on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured
          appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's

          Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.

          Standing in the corner of his cage, Caesar pulls STEWART'S
          SCISSORS and a roll of MEDICAL TAPE out from the STRAW.
          He kneels at his bedding, gathering sticks and straw. Then
          he begins weaving the tape through several sticks, binding
          them and extending them end to end.
          Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his
          shoulder, discovers MAURICE THE ORANGUTAN watching him.
          They hold each others' gaze, Caesar taking his measure. Then
          Caesar puts a finger to his lips. "Shhhh."

          The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate

          Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking
          at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND

<b>          LOCKS HIM IN.
</b>          Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making
          eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with

          Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED

          And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR

          Will wakes, climbs out of bed, careful not to wake Stewart.

</b>
          He moves down the hallway, approaching Walter's room. He
          pauses, puzzled, at the door - which is AJAR.
          Strange.

<b>          THE PHONE STARTS TO RING.

          get a safe shot.

<b>          AT THE NORTH END OF THE BRIDGE
</b>          Blocked off by CHP, all traffic stopped.
          A few helicopters touch down - SHARPSHOOTERS jump out, rifles
          ready, and follow on foot behind SQUAD CARS, FOUR ACROSS,

<b>          THAT SLOWLY DRIVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE - TOWARD THE APES.
</b>
<b>          DODGE IS AMONG THEM.
</b>
<b>          AT THE SOUTH END OF THE BRIDGE
</b>          Caesar and his apes race forward.

<b>          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
</b>
          Will and Stewart watch from above as the apes stream
          Northward, over and around stopped cars.

          WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a
          place on the bridge where there are no more cars.
          Then they'll be open season.
           Then HE SEES the FOUR SQUAD CARS slowly approaching from the
          north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot
          behind them.

<b>          ON THE BRIDGE
</b>          Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the
          bridge traffic.
          Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad
          cars.
          He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready.

</b>          He sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION

<b>          CABLES.
</b>          Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE.
          Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and
          swirls hundreds of feet below.
          Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing,
          taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him.
          Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car
          with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps.
          Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into
          the fog. Rocket's right behind.
          The remaining apes follow.

<b>          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
</b>
          From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army.
          Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of
          fog.
          Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck.
          And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled
          traffic.

<b>          BELOW THE BRIDGE

<b>                         ABOVE BRIDGE
</b>          Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at
          the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top.
          They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND

<b>          SWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM.
</b>          A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT.
          A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH
          the chimp hits the water.
          They keep moving.

<b>          ON THE BRIDGE

<b>          DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND

          apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.
          BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
          Another chimp falls to its death.
          Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
          of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's
          practically zero.

<b>          NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM

<b>          WHOOSH...
</b>          DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful
          of some visibility.
          That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,

<b>          CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.

          He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
          cable.
          ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE
          AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.
          Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES

<b>          CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.
</b>
<b>          ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR

<b>          UP.
</b>          Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO

</b>          Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.
          But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON

<b>          THE BRIDGE.
</b>          The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD

<b>          THE BARRICADE.

          Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to

          A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.
          And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --
          MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.
          Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.

          Will's helicopter has set down. He and Stewart stand near an
          ASSEMBLING ARMY -- an amalgamation of 'human special forces.'
          Huffs and a small GROUP OF OFFICERS debate nearby.

<b>                         OFFICER #1

</b>          I know where they are.
          The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy?

          Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods. They're at
          the path Caesar and Will used to take.
          She's terrified, trying to mask it.

          Will enters the clearing.

<b>          EXT. WOODS - DUSK
</b>
          Caesar lays Will out on the forest floor. There's a lot of
          blood.
          Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar.
          Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.
          Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.
          Then the life passes out of him.

<b>          EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DUSK
</b>
          Stewart sits in the back of a locked Police Car, looking out
          at the forest in the gathering darkness.
          All is quiet.
          The forest is vast, dark, green. Impenetrable.

<b>          HONK OF A HORN.
</b>
<b>          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          Hunsiker - Will's neighbor - exits his house with a small
          rolling suitcase. He's wearing his pilot's uniform.

<b>          INT. TAXI - NIGHT
</b>
           Hunsiker enters, settles into the seat.

<b>                          TAXI DRIVER
</b>           Where to, my man?
          It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT

<b>          GAVE JACOBS A RIDE HOME.
</b>
<b>                         HUNSIKER

<b>                         TAXI DRIVER
</b>          You got it.
          The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his
          forehead - he doesn't look too good.

<b>          INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT
</b>
          CLOSE ON WHEELS TURNING. Hunsiker pulls his suitcase on
          wheels through the airport terminal.
          It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,
          Hunsiker takes the escalator up.

<b>          INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
</b>
          Hunsiker says hello to the FLIGHT STAFF and moves to the
          front of the plane.

<b>          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
</b>
          Hunsiker shakes hands with his CO-PILOT and sits. He flicks
          a switch.

<b>          EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT
</b>
          The airplane takes off into the sky.

</b>          As the ape search continues, a
          virulent flu strain has exploded in
          and around San Francisco, sending
          shock waves and panic throughout
          the community.

<b>          EXT. CLEARING - DAY
</b>
          We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy
          of trees. As we get closer, we notice flashes of movement.

</b>          Authorities suspect the origin of
          the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys
          Laboratories - the same private
          company from which several
          laboratory chimpanzees escaped
          earlier this week -
          We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see
          it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.
          We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we
          move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING
