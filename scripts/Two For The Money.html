               A DAD tosses a baseball to his SON.  The boy swings, connects, 
               sends the ball flying.  DAD smiles.

</b>               That's me.  Five years old.  I remember that day.  Believe it 
               or not, I remember that hit.  I remember it because of the smile 
               that spread over my dad's face...

</b>               To pop, sports were a religion.  To me, it was about purity, 
               a place where all wrongs could be made right, or at least temporarily 
               forgotten.  I was going to fill the whole house with trophies

               Our eyes adjust to see we're in a STADIUM.  It's a night game. 
                Stands packed.  A PLAY CLOCK fills the SCREEN.  It's the fourth 
               quarter.  Seven seconds left.  Score:  CAL WEST 31 / SOUTH WEST 
               NEVADA UNIVERSITY 27.  A bruised and battered UNLV QUARTERBACK 
               gets a play from the COACH, straps on his helmet as he runs back 
               to the huddle.  The name on the QUARTERBACK'S jersey -- B. LANG. 
                10 exhausted, desperate faces come close, hang on BRANDON'S 
               every word --

</b>               Last play.  Slant red, right back on two.  On two, Scottie.  
               It's a lock.  A guaranteed TD.  I've already seen it.  So relax. 
                There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win 
               and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear 
               any "Hi moms."  Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it 
               and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me.  See 
               you in the end zone.
<b> 
</b>               The teams breaks, approaches the line.  Loud CROWD roar.

</b>               I'd been a quarterback since pee-wee football.  Set high school 
               records.  Won state championships.  I wasn't driven by joy, it 
               wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple -- fear of 
               losing.

               for Lang.  The big question, should he turn pro now or wait until 
               -- Lang's got the snap--
<b> 
</b>               BRANDON drops back.  A GIANT gets a hand on BRANDON'S jersey. 
                BRANDON pulls free, runs.  OPPONENTS charge his way, BRANDON 
               vaults, sails in the end zone, SCORES.  BRANDON rolls on his 
               back as an OPPOSING PLAYER hurtles in -- mid-air -- unable to 
               stop as -- 300-plus pounds come crashing onto BRANDON'S leg. 
                Sickening sound.  BRANDON clutches his strangely angled limb.

               SURGEONS regard the leg.  IVs are hooked up.

               BRANDON opens his eyes, focuses on his FATHER (older, cheap suit,

               Vegas desert.  It's raining.  A SWNU car pulls up.  The COACH 
               helps BRANDON out, on crutches now.  A middle-aged WOMAN and 
               a TEENAGE BOY stand under a rusty awning, waiting to greet him.

               the look on my mother's face, or how fast coach left after getting 
               me up the steps, but I swore then and there -- no matter what,

               Off-season.  The room's packed.  Loud hip hop plays.  BRANDON

               CROWDED arena.  Electrifying scene.  BRANDON'S suited on the

               of his own LINEMEN is knocked into him and -- BRANDON'S off balance.

</b>               That game's gonna be won by coaching, Stu.  Gruden put that Tampa 
               Bay team together before he came to Oakland, right?  He knows 
               every weakness of that team and every strength.  He knows Brown 
               only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him 
               double-teamed to the right.  He knows Gannon always throws on 
               a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of 
               the field.  Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday.

               Stu, how many times do I have to bail you out?  All right, listen, 
               forget the point spread.  Oakland's going to win outright.  Bet 
               the money line and bet big.

               Filled with exercise equipment.  BRANDON pins the letter to a

               the length of his leg makes you wonder.  As BRANDON pumps it

</b>               Chump change, Brandon.  We're angling for bigger fish here.  
               You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't 
               tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business. 
                These gamblers have needs, Brandon.  Come Monday morning, after 
               a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs.

</b>               That's every pro game played last Sunday.

               Do you know why Monday Night's the most watched game of the week? 
                It's because Monday's the last chance bettors have to climb 
               out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday.  Sports 
               betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what 
               we do is 100% legal -- it's exactly the same as a stock broker, 
               only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet. 
                We make the big money off our client list.  You see, when a 
               client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they 
               gladly give to keep getting our picks.  When they lose we get 
               zip.  So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend 
               -- is to win.

               Phone numbers and messages ("FOOTBALL SELECTIONS!" COLLEGE AND 
               PRO!"  "BASKETBALL PICKS!") flash on the screens.  It's a high-octane

               Ya know, Toni, this is my first time in town.  I'm not used to 
               how fast things run around here.  I'm wondering if you'd  like

</b>               ... He didn't tell you.

</b>               Walter's got a weird sense of humor.

               Look, he has a big, bright, beautiful spirit, you'll love working 
               for him, but he's held together by meetings.  If it has "anonymous" 
               at the end, Walter goes.  He has to.  He also has to be very 
               careful who he let's into his life.  In  most ways, Walter's 
               brilliant -- but he can be bullshitted and I can't.  So he sends 
               'em over to me before he hires 'em.

               C'mon Walter.  You might as well go to Atlantic City and open

               I give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he 
               made last year.  If not, he gives me a grand, which I'll give

               Hi.  I've been going to meetings like this for 18 years.  Once 
               a week, every Friday night, for 18 years.  This, my friends,

<b>

               I've listened to thousands of sob stories by people like Leon 
               here, and I gotta say, Leon -- if I learned one thing it's that 
               gambling is not your problem. 
<b> 
</b><b>                                     LEON
</b>               It's not?

<b>                                     WALTER
</b>               Not even close.  You're a lemon.  Like a bad car, there's something 
               inherently defective in you.  And you.  And me!  All of us here 
               -- we're lemons!  Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons! 
                We look like everyone else but we're defective because when 
               most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate 
               gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose. 
                All humans like going to the edge of the abyss, but what makes 
               us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into 
               the void!  And we like doing it so much we do it time after time 
               after time!  Me?  I always felt most alive when they were raking 
               away the chips, and every one here knows what I'm talking about. 
                People like us, even when we win, it's just a matter of time 
               before we give it all back.  But when we lose, and I mean the 
               kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a 
               decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and 
               you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side 
               of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly 
               realize -- hey, I'm still here, I'm still breathing, I'm still 
               alive!  In order to really live you have to be aware of your 
               own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is one of 
               the best ways

</b>               I know of getting that feeling.  When you win, you defy death, 
               but when you lose, 
<b> 
</b>               you survive it, and that's remarkable! 

               Us lemons, we fuck shit up on purpose!  We need to constantly 
               remind ourselves
<b> 
</b>               that we're alive!  Gambling's not the problem, Leon, your fucked 
               up need to feel something, to convince yourself you exist, to 
               test what's really real, that's the problem!

               Jerry, maybe you break your losing streak, end the shneid, start 
               winning again and find yourself another job, but then of course 
               maybe you don't.  I don't see you taking that chance.  My gut 
               says you'll walk out of here on principle or even pride but not 
               on a gamble, a hunch yet.  And if you do, fuck it.  I give a 
               shit?  The only reason I keep you around is it makes me look

               I'm a fucked-up human being.  That's the difference between us. 
                Right there.  Jerry's a statistician, I'm a gambler.  And you're

               bet to feel a win?  Winning's a funny thing, Mr. Novian... it's

</b>               And we've never charged it before.  But with what you're betting, 
               250 up front's a bargain.  You want this weekend's winners, that's 
               my offer.  Take it or leave it.

               I know is a full-time job,

               two blocks down Prospect Street you would have found me 20 years 
               ago with a needle in my arm.  I was a 5-bag a day junkie.  I

</b>               I didn't recognize you without the suit, John.

<b> 
</b>               I know more than your name, Brandon.  I know where you're from. 
                Where your family lives.  Hell, I just came from Vegas.  Your 
               Mom, sweet lady... dealt me three blackjacks in a row.

               The BODYGUARD grabs his arm.  Iron grip.

</b>               Feel that?  I hate the cold.  Winter's coming.  Water's getting

               NOVIAN inches from BRANDON.  Unbuttons his coat.  Sound of a

                BRANDON jumps.  The BODYGUARD holds him.  NOVIAN comes close. 
                BRANDON struggles, very unsure where this might be going and--

               at the tv over a remote.  The sports wrap-up comes on, scores 
               flashing on the screen.  No clue how he did until his phone rings. 
                Then his cell vibrates.  BRANDON gets out of bed.  Fully dressed.

                Seconds before kickoff of the New York/Atlanta game.  JULIA 
               climbs into WALTER'S lap, holding her puppy.

               Look, you got a magnificent gift.  Own that.  So you strike out 
               sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences.  You're 
               a champion, Brandon.  A champion goes down 186 times but gets 
               up 187.  I'm not letting you stay down.  This isn't about you 
               or me or Toni, this transcends that -- this is metaphysical, 
               this is cosmic, this is eternal -- this is God... Besides, we 
               have a contract.

                Come Sunday you're either ending the season a winner or a loser! 
                It's crunch time!  The last action on the way out the door!

               we did sleep together?  Living with it like that?  Looking at 
               me like that?  You sick fuck!  You wanted to lose!  You set us 
               up!  Like I was something you just toss on the table!  Only we 
               booked your bet, Walter!

</b>               Brandon and me.  The two of us, who evidentally love you more 
               than you love yourself.  Your fantasy's to end up alone with 
               nothing!  Well I won't let that happen to you!  Understand?  
               I will never let that happen!  This is it!  We're all we have,

<b>               INT. JFK AIRPORT BAR - NIGHT
</b>

               CAMERA on the tv.  Blaring the game.  Bar going crazy as the 
               New York QUARTERBACK runs for the end zone.  Juking LINEMEN. 
                Dodging tackles.  Nearing the goal.  A last-second block clears 
               a lane and the QUARTERBACK barrels by, dives -- a hit -- a fumble 
               on the goal line -- a beat -- a replay -- a REFEREE signaling 
               a touchdown -- and the game's over -- and New York has won, but 
               more importantly they've covered the spread and --

               A dozen 9-year-old PEE-WEE FOOTBALL PLAYERS, barely able to move 
               in over-sized gear, are lined for practice.  BRANDON, coach's

               want you to go out there and have some fun.  Enjoy yourselves. 
                Keep it loose.  Because you can't make me any more proud of 
               you than I already am.  Team cheer, bring it in --

               The KIDS scramble across the field, other TEAM seen suited and 
               ready.  PARENTS on the sideline.  One of BRANDON'S tiny TEAMMATES 
               hangs back, approaches BRANDON.
