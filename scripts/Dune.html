     FADE IN to the dark eyes of the mysterious face of
     the REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO, who sits against smooth
     black rock. Her eyes are deep blue-within-blue and
     her skin is a haunting translucent white. Her voice
     ECHOES as if in a great cavern.

</b>               We are the secret of the Universe. We know
               of spice...the spice called melange...the
               greatest treasure in the Universe. It
               exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis,
               Dune. We know of spice and the Bene
               Gesserit sisterhood's selective breeding
               plan of ninety generations to produce the
               Kwisatz Haderach, the one the spice will
               awaken.

     Silence...then a powerful low organ NOTE resounding
     in the cavernous space.

<b>            REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO (CONT'D)
</b>               He will come...the voice from the outer

               us out of darkness. He will have been born
               of a Bene Gesserit mother.

</b>     The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the

     BLOWS louder and louder, obscuring her voice.

     subtly.

     PULL BACK to a shot revealing the outside of the

     we can see the distorted image of a space ship
     landing on a sophisticated landing field.

<b>7.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT
</b>
     The EMPEROR is surrounded by crowds of COURTIERS in
     his Throne Room.

     Suddenly a GUARD enters from a small door and
     quickly crosses to ANOTHER GUARD. A warning SOUND
     begins. The Emperor turns nervously. Guards quickly
     begin to clear the large room. Several women are
     rushed toward us to a door beyond. One of the woman,
     IRULAN, stops and turns back for a worried, caring
     look to her father, the Emperor.

<b>                         IRULAN

     She sees that SARDAUKAR OFFICERS are surrounding him
     now, speaking to him. Irulan turns and leaves. The
     Emperor moves away from his officers to the center
     of the now-empty room. He drops his golden robe from
     his shoulders. He stands in his elegant black
     uniform, thinking.

     The Reverend Mother is ushered in and the Sardaukar
     Officers leave her alone with the Emperor.

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>                    (quickly)
               A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here
               within minutes!

<b>                     REVEREND MOTHER
</b>               We felt his presence.

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>               I shall want telepathy during his visit
               and a report when we're finished.

<b>                     REVEREND MOTHER
</b>               Their minds are so.... They move in
               strange directions....

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>               Yes?

<b>                     REVEREND MOTHER
</b>               Forced spice evolution of humans changes
               many things.... I must sit close to him.

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>               He will not permit anyone but me to see
               him. You must be outside this room.... Do
               what you can.

<b>                     REVEREND MOTHER
</b>               I am your Truthsayer, my lord...
                    (sensing something outside the room)
               He is here, my lord.

     Under the carved inscription "Law is the Ultimate
     Science", the doors to the Emperor's chambers slide
     open and FIFTY GUILDSMEN wheel in a forty-foot long
     giant black box. One of the Guildsmen addresses the
     Emperor through a translating device.

</b>               Leave us.

<b>                     REVEREND MOTHER

               We are alone...

<b>8.   INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT
</b>
     The Reverend Mother enters through doors and takes a
     seat on a chair just outside the door. She closes
     her eyes.

<b>9.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT
</b>
     Inside the Emperor's chamber, the TANK-SUITED
     GUILDSMEN are arranging themselves in a "V"
     formation around the box. Suddenly the box opens,
     slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass
     tank. Inside the tank floats a THIRD STAGE NAVIGATOR
     twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty,
     pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper.

     The tank is filled with swirling orange spice-gas,
     and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic
     chemical spills dripping from under the tank.
     Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the
     Emperor. His head is enormous and fleshy, like a
     huge grasshopper head -- the eyes are totally deep
     blue. His voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an
     intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the
     tank translates into English and broadcasts it into
     the room.

<b>                        NAVIGATOR
</b>               We have just folded space from Ix...

<b>                         EMPEROR

               Yes?... How was your journey?

<b>                        NAVIGATOR
</b>                    (after a long pause)
               Many machines on Ix... new machines.

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>               Oh yes?

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>               Is there a problem?... Usually there is a
               problem when one of you makes a visit.

     No answer.

<b>                        NAVIGATOR
</b>                    (finally)
               The answer is within the problem...

<b>10.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT

     Outside the Emperor's chamber the Reverend Mother
     sits, her eyes closed, straining.

<b>11.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND
</b><b>MOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT
</b>
     A very blurred scene of the Emperor with the Guild
     Navigator. She is not getting the English version
     but a much different language version which is
     fascinating to listen to. A lilting, sing-song
     monologue.

<b>12.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT
</b>
<b>                        NAVIGATOR
</b>               I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides,
               House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you
               behind it.

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>               Yes.

     The Navigator breathes the spice-gas heavily and
     swishes gently in his tank.

<b>                        NAVIGATOR
</b>               You must share with us.

               army!... using a technique unknown to
               us... a technique involving sound. The
               Duke is becoming more popular in the
               Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I
               have ordered House Atreides to occupy
               Arrakis to mine the spice... thus
               replacing their enemies the Harkonnens....
               House Atreides will not refuse because of
               the tremendous power they think they will
               gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron
               Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and
               launch a sneak attack on House Atreides...
               I have promised the Baron five legions of
               my Sardaukar terror troops.

<b>                        NAVIGATOR
</b>               So the Harkonnens will rid you of House
               Atreides...

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>               Yes.

     Outside, the Reverend Mother is seeing the scene
     mentally. She suddenly sees and flinches.

     The Guild Navigator turns toward her and comes very
     close to her. We hear the Navigator speak to her.

               anything to do with spice...
<b>--
</b>     The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite
     violently in his tank.

<b>                        NAVIGATOR
</b>               LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the
               spice has given me accelerated evolution

     In the background, FOOTSTEPS grow louder, pounding
     on thick wooden floors. THUFIR HAWAT, GURNEY HALLECK

     Thufir suddenly looks perturbed when he notices
     this.

<b>                         GURNEY
</b>               Not sorry enough.

     Gurney draws his knife.

<b>25B. SHIELD EFFECT - THE FIGHT
</b>
     Gurney activates his body shield, sending a
     shimmering FORCE FIELD around his body. He advances
     swiftly toward Paul. Paul snaps on his FORCE FIELD,
     draws his knife and jumps back, collecting himself
     hurriedly for the fight.

<b>                         GURNEY
</b>                    (his voice sounding strange through

               Guard yourself for true!

     Gurney leaps high, then forward, pressing a furious
     attack. Paul falls back. The shield edges CRACK
     loudly as they touch each other.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>                    (inner voice)
               What's gotten into Gurney? He's not
               faking.
     Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly
     around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger
     as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul
     directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney
     against the table, plunging at just the right moment
     to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade
     right at Gurney's neck.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>                    (strange shielded voice)
               Is this what you seek?

<b>                         GURNEY
</b>                    (strange shielded voice)
               Good... the slow blade penetrates the
               shield... but look down.

     Paul looks and sees Gurney's blade at his groin.

<b>                     GURNEY (CONT'D)
</b>               We'd have joined each other in death.
               However, you did seem to finally get the
               "mood".

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Would you really have drawn my blood?

<b>                         GURNEY
</b>               If you'd fought one whit below your
               abilities I'd have scratched you a good
               one.

     Paul stands and snaps off his shield as does Gurney.

<b>25.  BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Things have been so serious here lately.

<b>                         GURNEY
</b>               Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but
               this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we
               leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The
               Harkonnens are real.

     Thufir, Yueh, Gurney and Paul stare at each other
     for a moment in silence. Dr. Yueh moves forward and
     begins to take Paul's pulse rate and to collect
     other data with a small black machine.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on
               the worms of Arrakis?
<b>--
</b><b>                        DR. YUEH
</b>               I have obtained a filmbook on a small
               specimen... only 125 meters long.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Only?!

     They smile at each other.

<b>                        DR. YUEH
</b>               There are have been documented sightings
               of worms as large as 450 meters in the
               deep desert -- far from where we'll be in
               Arakeen.... The desert belt and the south
               polar regions are marked forbidden....
               Why?

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               The storms and the worms. Is it true, that
               the sand can blow at seven hundred
               kilometers per hour?

<b>                          YUEH
</b>               It can render flesh to dust in minutes.
               And these dry winds can generate
               tremendous static electricity in the
               atmosphere. Our body shields won't have
               enough power to operate in the open air on
               Arrakis.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Well, how do the Fremen survive there?

<b>                          YUEH
</b>               We don't know much about the Fremen...
               They live in the deep desert... some of
               them in the cities and they have blue-
               within-blue eyes...

<b>                          PAUL
</b>                    (smiling)
               The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the
               blood by the spice -- melange. Could the
               spice affect us in other ways?

<b>                         THUFIR
</b>               Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we
               know the Harkonnens would not have given
               up their CHOAM company contract so easily.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>                    (rising)
               The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but
               behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.
<b>--
</b><b>                         THUFIR
</b>               You will make a formidable Duke!

     Paul bows.

<b>                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
</b>               Now remember... the first step in avoiding
               a trap is knowing of its existence.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               I know.  But if it is a trap then why are
               we going?

<b>                         THUFIR
</b>               We have our new army.
                    (in the same breath)
               Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.

     Thufir, noticing a SQUAD OF GUARDS at the other end
     of the training room, calls out to them.

<b>                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
</b>               Clear and lock the room.

     Gurney activates a series of locks.  LIGHTS GLOWS
     above each doorway.

</b>               Activate a fighter.

<b>25C. ROBOT FIGHT
</b>
     Suddenly a FIGHTER ROBOT lowers from the ceiling.
     As the robot begins to rotate and go through several
     frightening, complicated movements, Dr. Yueh places
     a plastic device around Paul's neck.  He tightens it
     around the Adam's apple above Paul's voice box.
     Paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound
     through the weirding module as he rushes towards the
     robot.

<b>                         GURNEY
</b>                    (to Yueh)
               Precise control....

     The hallway is empty in the foreground but in the
     distance a changing of the guard is seen.

<b>27.  INT. HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT
</b>
     Paul walks down the stairway.  In the distance,
     moving troops are packing Atreides belongings.
     Beyond, Paul sees some troops carrying a large
     bull's head.  The horns are covered with dried
     blood.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               The bull that killed my grandfather... is
               this an evil omen?

     Suddenly, DUNCAN IDAHO appears from behind the giant
     black head.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>                    (happily)

                    (they shake hands)
               I was on my way to say goodbye to you.  I
               have to go on ahead.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Why?  I wish you were coming with us.

<b>                         DUNCAN
</b>               It's something for your father.  He wants
               to talk to you.
                    (places hand on Paul's chest)
               I'll see you in Arrakis.  May the hand of
               God be with you.

<b>                          PAUL

               Duncan.

<b>28.  EXT. CLIFF WALL - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Paul walks to meet his father near the wall.

</b>                    (diffident)

<b>28B. DUKE LETO AND PAUL AGAINST SEA
</b>
     They look out over the sea.  A huge wave crashes
     below.

     The Duke turns to Paul.

<b>                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)
</b>                    (inner voice)
               My son.
                    (out loud)
               Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides
               three generations....  He swears you are
               the finest student he's ever taught.
               Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same....
               It makes me feel very proud...

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               I want you to be proud of me.

     Paul smiles up at his father.  The WIND blows the
     Duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the
     green and black Atreides banner against the night
     sky beyond.  The RAIN starts again -- lightly.  Paul
     takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in
     the wind.

<b>                        DUKE LETO
</b>                    (studying the dark sea below)
               I'll miss the sea... but a person needs
               new experiences... they jar something deep
               inside, allowing him to grow.  Without
               change, something sleeps inside us... and
               seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken.

     Paul's attention goes to his father's hand where he
     sees the Duke's signet ring.  Again he smiles at his
     father.

     Paul is sweating during his sleep and WHISPERS as if
     struggling with some disturbing thought.

     We see Paul's dream. It is very dark.

<b>                       PAUL (V.O.)
</b>               Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.

     Suddenly a drop falls into the black, and white hot
     widening rings appear on the dark water's surface.

     Darkness again. Two moons rise in the darkness. As
     the second appears:

<b>                          VOICE
</b>               The second moon, your moon...

     Dark again. A figure turns toward Paul. It is a
     BEAUTIFUL GIRL in deep shadow. She speaks.

     CU Paul's face in fitful sleep.

<b>33.  EXT. COURTYARD - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT
</b>
     In a small stone courtyard, the back-lit figure of a
     woman moves towards us through the heavy RAIN and
     darkness. As she nears us, the large, protective
     glowglobe overtakes her and in an instant we see a
     beautiful woman -- JESSICA.

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>                    (inner voice)
               I  know she has come to test him... no man
               has ever been tested with the box... only
               Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son.

     The doors open, she meets the Reverend Mother Gaius
     Helen Mohiam (the Emperor's truthsayer) and takes
     her back toward the Castle. The rain rushes loudly
     into the storm drains.

               moving... moving.

     CU Paul's face.

     Paul's eyes snap open. He hears footsteps outside
     his door. As the door opens he closes his eyes,
     however, and he pretends to be asleep. Jessica and
     the Reverend Mother enter and stand in the doorway
     looking at him.

               nothing.

     Jessica turns to the Reverend Mother, stunned! She
     turns back to look at Paul. Her hands tremble.

<b>                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Did you really think that you could bear

<b>42.  INT. DUKE LETO'S QUARTERS - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT

     Under a dim glowglobe, the DUKE is writing a note on
     a scroll-like piece of paper.

     Finishing reading, the Duke seals the message in a
     cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red
     hawk symbol of House of Atreides, into a hole, which
     seals the cylinder with a swift HISSING.

     He pauses, studying the metal tube. With a VOICE
     COMMAND, he extinguishes the glowglobe above him. He
     leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside
     the window.

               Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.

     Jessica leaves the room. The Reverend Mother speaks
     to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training
     which permits an adept to control others merely by
     selected tone shadings of the voice. It sounds as if
     two people are talking -- one normal and the other
     gutteral and slightly electronic. The effect is
     strange, yet subtle.

<b>                     REVEREND MOTHER

     Paul finds he cannot help but obey her, yet he
     fights her controlling him.

<b>                          PAUL

     She sees him struggling.

                    (out loud)
               Come here.

     The Reverend Mother holds up a green metal cube.

<b>                REVEREND MOTHER (CONT'D)

</b>               Pain.

     Just then, she raises one hand to his neck. Paul
     sees a glint of metal. He tries to back away.

     The surface of the planet is a vast sea of black

     toward a gigantic black city in the shape of a
     rectangular box over 100 stories high. Before the

     and Piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and
     enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being
     treated by a DOCTOR for sores on his face and body.
     The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the
     Baron's lips. The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and
     sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some
     time. He turns to Piter as he enters the room.

               Baron and the Emperor.

               And turn it round real neat.

     His assistant does so.

     Rabban breaks open a squood (living food).  The
     squood makes a tiny SCREAM, then Rabban drinks the
     blood and bodily fluids.  He throws the empty
     container of tiny animal meat into the dark water
     trough running through the center of the room.
     Across the room, TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter,
     holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white
     pants.  The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who
     is deeply afraid.  The guards force the boy to
     arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall
     opposite the Baron.

               close to Duke Leto.  This person... this

               die before these eyes and he'll know that
               it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who
               encompasses his doom.
<b>--
</b>     The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the
     wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS.  Suddenly the
     Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet
     in the air.  It is a frightening sight.  He floats
     down under the giant, humming electrical tube light
     and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which
     drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink
     glow.  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously.  The
     Attendants stand completely still with fear.

     The Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands
     petrified.  The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as
     they step slightly backwards.  The boy begins
     SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug,
     located in his chest.  The violet flowers are bumped
     and disarrayed by the violence which ensues.  Then
     the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS
     continue to roar.

<b>57.  INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE

     We pass through electrical shields into a 2,000-foot
     high control room filled with orange spice gas. On
     the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and
     filtering system. Tons of spice gas are being
     converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of
     machinery. From within a dark metal tunnel comes a
     Guild Navigator. He exits the tunnel and swims
     through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional
     layered miniature replica of the entire Universe.
     The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his
     mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and
     changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan. The
     Navigator turns and emits another piece of light
     which travels to the opposite side of the Universe.
     It changes into a likeness of Arrakis. The Navigator
     begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the
     stars and he emits SOUNDS and bursts of light into
     the mass of stars and galaxies. The Universe begins
     to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. Electrical
     lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the
     Universe bends into a U-shape. Arrakis submerges
     deep into the light. The navigator swims to the
     point where Arrakis disappeared. He begins to pull
     and tear a hole in the Universe. Stars like sparks
     and SOUNDS and rings of light appear, along with a
     roaring WIND. The Navigator swims deep into this
     hole through the rings of light. The Navigator
     becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost
     in darkness. The sounds fade.

     Thufir marches down a hallway with a squad of TROOPS
     with electronic gadgetry, LIGHTS and SOUNDS going
     constantly.

               Why isn't the shield up yet?

<b>73.  INT. GENERATOR ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY
</b>
     Down in the basement, Atreides engineers are
     removing a complicated device from heavy machinery.
     A MAN radios back to Thufir.

</b>     The engineers activate a series of atometric
     Holtzman generators. Suddenly SOUNDS begin. The
     machines start; at first low, then they WHINE
     upwards to a high pitch. When the pitch is steady, a
     series of levers are pulled.

<b>74.  EXT. PALACE - ARRAKEEN - DAY
</b>
     Just after the second set of levers is pulled, a
     huge house shield is seen going up in a box shape,
     encompassing the Palace with SHIMMERING protection.

<b>75.  EXT. WINDOW - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY

     From a small window, Thufir observes the shield with
     a critical eye.

</b>                    (inner voice; worried)

     Two giant glowglobes drift into the Great Hall where
     Jessica and Dr. Yueh stand watching a giant bull's
     head is being hung above the massive fireplace. The
     MOVING TROOPS are unpacking crates and organizing
     furnishings. Jessica watches them. Distant SOUNDS
     reverberate inside an elaborate air vent beside
     them.

<b>                        DR. YUEH
</b>               Listen here.... You can here the people of

               "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers?

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               So many reminders of the scarcity of
               water.

<b>                        DR. YUEH
</b>               Have you noticed the line of palms along
               the wall... the Harkonnen put them in...
               to flaunt their water wealth in front of
               these people.... Each day those palms take
               enough water to sustain the life of one
               hundred men.

     Jessica sees a droplet of sweat break out on Yueh's
     cheek.

<b>                        DR. YUEH
</b>               I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it.

     Above them a series of iron curtains begins to open
     over deep rock window slots, sending  narrow shafts
     of light down across the room. TWO ATREIDES WOMEN in
     uniform approach.

<b>                    ATREIDES WOMAN #1
</b>                    (referring to several robed figures

               My lady... the local people... the maids
               and servants await your inspection. Hawat
               has cleared them.

     Dr. Yueh turns to Jessica.

<b>                        DR. YUEH
</b>               The Harkonnens may have tampered
               medically.... please wait.

     He turns a yellow light on a moves it over the
     crowd. The yellow light beam plays over the blue-
     within-blue eyes. One of the women, the Shadout
     Mapes, watches Jessica continuously. Yueh's hand
     shakes slightly.

<b>                         JESSICA

               He's hiding something -- holding something
               back.
                    (She studies his face closely.)
               It's not just his wife... He's a good man
               though. He's probably trying to save my
               feelings...
                    (We see her mouth.)
               I could use The Voice... make him tell
               me... It would only shame him.

     Paul wanders through the darkened passageways alone,
     his footsteps echoing as goes. He takes pleasure
     observing the details of the rock Palace but all the
     while he feels an uneasiness -- a feeling of fear
     builds in him.

<b>78.  INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY
</b>
     Paul enters a small bedroom and sits down on the
     bed. He opens the filmbook, and activates it.

     We SEE a gigantic carryall lower down above a spice
     harvester and pick it up off the desert floor as a
     narrator speaks over.

<b>                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>               One carryall handles four spice mining
               teams; however, it will fly only two

               hundred and eighty-one carryalls....

<b>78.  BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     Paul looks up. Across the room he sees a tray of
     small pastries which have been laid out. He goes to
     them and scans them with his poison detector, which
     he carries on his belt. A pleasant tone SOUNDS and
     the word "safe" appears in green light. Paul takes a
     pastry bites it and turns back towards the bed.
     Suddenly he stops. He looks at the pastry.

     As he continues eating he notices the sunlight
     through the slates over the window begins to GLOW
     white hot. Paul's eyes are intense as the light
     GLOWS brilliantly.

     TROOPS come off an elevator. The glow-span indicates
     the very bottom floor of 18 sub-floors. The ground
     is uneven rock and the ceiling is low. The troops
     fan out shining chemical lamps here and there. A
     soldier suddenly stops. Ahead in his light is a dead
     Harkonnen -- bloody vomit dried around his mouth. He

     of the Palace. Some are chanting "Mahdi" and "Lisan
     al-Gaib." Others hold up one open hand as a sign
     they feel the messiah is near. A slow-moving spike-

     brilliant light bursts over his face. The others are
     all talking among themselves. Suddenly Thufir's face
     turns brilliant red (as red as his sapho-stained
     lips) and he begins speaking rapidly into the

               the second. The salt is separated.
               Breathing and walking provide the pumping
               action. The reclaimed water circulates to
               catchpockets from which you can drink
               through this tube at your neck. Urine and
               feces are processed in the thigh pads.

               to breathe in through your mouth, out
               through the nose tubes.

     The Duke is now properly fitted. Kynes places the
     noseplug into his nose.

     The men press on Gurney and Paul.  Paul can feel the
     fear. The sound is a horrible ROAR and deeper
     RUMBLING now and the `thopter is vibrating and
     shaking violently.  The air suddenly begins to SPARK
     with static electricity.

     turns down an even darker passageway.  He can hear
     the shield WHINING in the distance.  He almost has
     to feel his way.  Up ahead he sees a shape.  He
     bends down and sees the SHADOUT MAPES dying on the

     Jessica and Paul, bound by cabin straps, lie in the

     `thopters and ships fly past them toward the city.
     The distant FIRES play over Jessica's face as she
     sees Yueh's triangular tattoo scratched in the cabin

     #2's chest, killing him.  Guard #1 pulls the knife
     out, smiling.  The ornithopter begins to veer off

     his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and
     drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out
     the man's mouth.  Paul grabs the controls but it's

     travelling across a greater distance.  The Baron
     looks to Leto and then moves to him, looking him

     Piter moves forward.  The Baron sees a suculent
     piece of chicken skin on the table.  He picks up the
     plate, then the chicken skin.

     beginning to move away, reaching for the small piece
     of chicken skin.  Piter leans close to Leto.

     turning, a dumbfounded look on his face.  He drops
     the plate, and backs away.

     There is a tremendous ROARING.  Bits of visions of

     dead legless cow which hangs from chains.  Rabban
     tears out the cow's tongue and eats it.  Then he
     exits through a door which closes behind him.

     The Baron is flying wildly, circling the outside of
     a large steel shower, while Nefud and a DWARF play a
     strange instrument producing maniacal, perverse,
     screaming MUSIC.  The Baron SEES Rabban enter, but
     continues to fly around the shower.

               them!
                    (laughs)

     The Baron floats to Rabban and begins lovingly
     massaging Rabban's massive neck as he speaks to him.

               squeeze and squeeze.
                    (massaging in rhythm)
               Give me spice!  Drive them into utter
               submission.  You must not show the

     As Rabban leaves, he looks into one room of the

     that.

     Another burst of LIGHTNING.  The distant rock seems
     to have grown no larger.  Their muscles begin to

     Their breathing becomes very labored.  The sand
     moves like slow water, forever rolling down and up.
     Then they hear the worm, the low thundering HISS
     shaking the tonnage of sand.  The thumper stops.
     Paul turns.

     Their bodies ache and they feel like dropping, yet
     the cliff is still a good distance away.  The worm
     SOUND grows louder and Paul turns to look.

     A flash of LIGHTNING.  The worm is now coming toward
     them.  The mound of sand over the worm is enormous
     and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed.
     The power of this worm is awesome.

     All at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand.
     The SOUND is very loud.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Drum sand!

     The DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground.
     Jessica falls.  Paul stops and drags her up.  They
     run again.  The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud.
     Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white
     LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone.  Finally they
     find rock.  Behind them the SOUND of the worm
     changes.  They turn.

<b>154. EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT
</b>
     The gigantic head of the worm is just breaking
     through the sand.  The mouth begins to open in an
     eighty-foot circle of teeth and darkness.  The mouth
     arches forward searching for them.

     Paul and Jessica climb up and up inside a narrow
     slit of rock.

     The worm's mouth climbs higher also but it cannot
     penetrate the narrow opening in the rock.

</b>
     Paul and Jessica have scrambled upwards a couple of
     hundred feet.

<b>156A.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT
</b>
     Still the worm stretches up to them.  Suddenly the
     worm begins BANGING on the rock.  Huge SHUDDERS
     drive through the black stone.  Over and over again
     the worm mindlessly hits at the rock.

<b>156B.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT
</b>
     Paul and Jessica crouch further back in the tiny
     passageway of safety, but a solid back wall of rock
     prevents them from moving back any more.

     Suddenly a colossal section of the rock wall cracks
     and topples off into the worm's mouth.  Instantly
     the worm pulls back.  A huge FIRE roars deep within
     the worm consuming the rock.

     The worm now can get even closer to Paul and
     Jessica.  It looms up again and crushes its mouth up
     against the rock.

<b>158A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

     Another fissure opens, and suddenly half the rock
     wall protecting them splits off entirely and
     falls... taking Paul with it.

     ...against the worm.

     Paul is knocked off the cliff and falls straight
     down two hundred feet.  His feet skid along the face
     of rock.  He bounces and brakes.  He hits and jumps.
     He careens from one boulder, flies upside down,
     rights himself then tumbles and skids into the sand.
     Unhurt, he jumps up and scrambles up another part of
     the rock to safety.

     after the worm assault.

     The worm is just coming up again when distant
     THUMPING is heard.  The worm, as if charmed by the
     sound, turns and moves off towards it.

               not alone.

     They climb upwards until the ledge ends at the mouth
     of a dark crevice.  Paul and Jessica try to see into
     the inky black hole.

<b>163. EXT. CREVICE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT
</b>
     Slowly Paul and Jessica enter, inching forward.  A
     low moan of WIND comes up.  Paul can see nothing,
     then suddenly he SEES stars above and SEES the hint
     of stairs cut into the rock.

               Yes...

     They climb the steps and enter an extremely narrow
     dark channel of stone.  As they make their way
     through the rock, suddenly there is a burst of
     lightning which illuminates a whole troop of Fremen
     standing silently in front of them.

</b>     A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the
     Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and
     just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon,
     Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls
     again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar
     helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat.
     Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky
     incline.

     two rocks on a low cliff overlooking the rest of the
     Fremen troop.

     Up on the rock, Paul turns.  He takes a step, then
     notices a small figure standing in front of him.  It
     is a girl.

     Thousands of Fremen wait below.  Paul enters a rock
     ledge, guided by two monks, which is crowded with
     Fremen and old Fremen Monks.  Below the crowds
     continue to watch and wait while a giant wind organ
     moans.  A Monk steps up to Paul.

<b>                          MONK

               know... you must conquer the beast of the

               Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once
               again in control of Arrakis.  Stilgar,
               your leader, has asked me and my mother to
               crush the Harkonnens.  We must do more
               than this.  We must totally destroy all
               spice production on Arrakis.  The Guild
               and the entire universe depends on spice.

               "He who can destroy a thing, controls a
               thing".

               I will take one hundred of your warriors
               and train them.  This one hundred will
               train the thousands that remain.  When the
               spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to
               Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor
               himself will be forced to deal with us.
               Arrakis will become the center of the

<b>182. INT. TRAINING ROOM - SIETCH TABR - DAY

     Large room with a low ceiling.  A drummer playing
     makes a low ECHOING MUSICAL HIT.  A big block of
     stone is moved across coarse sand -- back and forth
     -- fast.  A rhythm is started -- powerful.  Paul
     enters, pauses and looks to Jessica - he stands in
     front of over 100 Fremen men.  Jessica sits behind
     him alongside Stilgar.

     A large rock obelisk has been placed near Paul for
     this demonstration.

               will teach you.  You will be the fiercest

               Our way of battle is built on rhythm.  You

               yet understand the rhythm of the higher
               sounds, sounds that heal and build...
               sounds that destroy.  Motion is the base.
               You understand the motion... but you do

     The Fremen laugh -- the rock doesn't move.

     A Fremen with a lasgun tries to cut it.  Paul
     motions him back, slightly.

<b>                          PAUL

     Paul also moves back.  He switches on his weirding
     module.  He opens his mouth and makes a small SOUND,
     which the module amplifies.

<b>                          PAUL

     Fremen carry the Fremen REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO in
     on a litter.  The old Reverend Mother is old a frail
     yet extremely beautiful and mysterious.  She turns
     to Paul and Jessica with a strange look.

<b>                 REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO
</b>                    (to Jessica, in an ancient voice)
               So you are the ones.

     She turns away towards the monks who are very busy
     blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice,
     purifying the area of the rite.  Several Fremen blow
     on dip sticks and a FEMALE CHOIR begins a haunting
     chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low
     notes below.

     Paul looks to his mother.

     He then sees Chani.

     CU Chani.

     CU Paul -- he cannot stop looking at her.

     Stilgar motions to Paul.

<b>                         STILGAR

               ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries...
               the end and the beginning.

     He shows Paul through a narrow passageway -- almost
     a slot through the stone to a small room.  Through
     an opening in the stone wall, Paul is shown a very
     strange and somewhat horrifying scene.

<b>189. INT. BABY WORM - MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT
</b>
     A thirty-foot baby worm is being lowered into a
     stone chamber.  The chamber is then covered with a
     wire top.  Valves are turned and water rushes into
     the chamber.  The worm begins to writhe violently
     and leap and bang against the bars above.  The worm
     begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it
     begins to gag.  Some monks and watermasters quickly
     drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out
     using large steel hooks.  They hold the worm above a
     large tub.  A watermaster-reed man runs a long reed
     in to the worm, causing it to spasm and gag up a
     beautiful deep blue bile as it dies.

<b>189A.     INT. MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT

     The bile and worm water are combined in ceremonial

     Then we HEAR from Paul's memory his conversation
     with the Reverend Mother:

<b>                     REVEREND MOTHER
</b>               ... Many men have tried.

<b>                          PAUL

     Stilgar and Paul return to the ledge above the Hall
     of Rites.  A MONK PRIEST steps forward, addresses
     the crowd, silencing them.  The other monks move
     back carrying their smoking cleansing bags.

<b>                         MONK #1

     He brings the jug close to Jessica.

     violently.  She screams.  The Reverend Mother
     screams with her.

     Inside Jessica, we see the Reverend Mother Ramallo's

     water starts to ripple, lightly stirring an image of
     Jessica.

     As the hand penetrates, something deep within her
     starts to GLOW.  It is a fetus, a female.  The
     Reverend Mother Ramallo's hand flinches as it
     touches the fetus.  The fetus sparks to life -
     screaming and rapidly spasming upwards on its

     HEAT WAVES... dunes RHYTHM.  THUNDEROUS approach of
     the worm.  Paul still cannot see the worm, but the
     sound begins to drown out the Fremen rhythm
     instruments and the sand begins to VIBRATE.
     Suddenly, Paul SEES...

     ...a mountain of sands rise up, towering, thundering
     -- lightning SPARKS fissuring throughout the air
     above the worm.

     The mountain approaches at a terrifying speed.
     Then, the worm appears -- rushing.  The mouth, at
     first a small opening, begins to widen -- exposing a
     thousand glistening teeth.

     Paul freezes.  He lets the worm get closer and
     closer.  The HEAT WAVES distort the gigantic form,
     making it more hideous -- more foreign.  He moves
     forward.  The others watch anxiously.  This worm is
     big.  It is so much larger than imaged.  Its top
     towers 125 feet in the air.  The segments are each
     ten feet wide.

<b>219C.     EXT. VERTICAL SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Paul gets close and running alongside, he plants the
     hook under a segment and pulls back.  The SOUND is
     excruciatingly loud.  The sand is so deep and more
     is being thrown out beneath the body of the worm.
     Paul gets caught in it and falls. He narrowly
     escapes being sucked under the beast.  He gets up --
     runs again and plants the hook once more.  He runs
     faster, bending the segment open to expose the
     tender flesh.

<b>219D.     EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY

     Suddenly the worm begins to turn.  Paul pulls
     himself up the body as it turns -- holding onto the
     hook.  Soon he is fifty -- sixty -- seventy feet off
     the ground -- going higher.  The giant worm gets the
     second thumper and Paul at that moment climbs to the
     top.  He plants the second hook.

</b>
     There is a growing, powerful sound of a worm
     approaching as Paul and Chani are lying together in
     the darkness of their sleeping chamber.  Paul's eyes
     snap open and he sees Chani looking down at him (the
     last image of the future in the desert).

</b>     In the hollow of a huge dune, Paul stops with Chani.
     They share a look into each other's eyes.  Paul
     turns towards the Fedaykin and nods.  They move in
     quickly to tie and wrap Paul in Fremen rope.  They
     move back and wait quietly.  Chani moves in very
     close to Paul.  She holds a glass vial of the blue
     water of life.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Hurry!  All I see is darkness.

               You are my life.

     out on the Rock Ledge overlooking the Hall of Rites
     which is crowded with Fremen warriors who chant
     "Maud'Dib" along with the powerful sounds of the
     WIND ORGAN and FREMEN war DRUMS.

     Paul raises his open hand.  SILENCE.  Only the organ

               In payment of the many years of service to
               my family, you may know ask of me anything
               you wish.  Anything at all.
                    (quietly)
               Do you need my life, old friend?

     He turns his back on him.

<b>                      PAUL (CONT'D)
</b>                    (quiet)
               It is yours.

     Thufir's eyes grow sad and wide.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to
               strike, do it now.

     Thufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old
     Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing
     motion.  Paul turns and catches him as he sags.

     His head lolls back and he looks up to Paul
     urgently.
<b>--
</b><b>                     THUFIR (CONT'D)
</b>               Three... generations... of you...

     His breath escapes him and he is dead.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>                    (to the guards)
               Carry this noble Atreides warrior away.
               Do him all honor.

     The guards do as they are instructed.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild

<b>                          PAUL
</b>                    (to the Guildsmen)
               Good.  You have some idea of what I would
               do but I will tell it to one who has never
               been seen... one who hides deep in the
               Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it
               first.

<b>                      GUILDSMEN #3
</b>                    (fear)
               No!

     Paul smiles as we move closer and closer to him.

<b>282. INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE
</b>
     Suddenly we are in the Heighliner control room, near
     the floor in the chemical spills.  We move up into
     the orange gas.  THUNDERING begins to shake the
     Heighliner.

<b>                       PAUL (V.O.)
</b>               Where are you....  Let me see you or there
               will be no spice.
<b>--
</b>     We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING.
     Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator.

<b>                   PAUL (V.O.)(CONT'D)
</b>               You know what I'm about to say is true....
               I have the power to destroy the spice
               forever.

     The Guild Navigator's mouth stretches back in a
     horrible MOAN.  The moan becomes more pained and
     grows louder and louder.

<b>283. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY
</b>
     The Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING
     and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen
     stop them.  The Emperor and all are amazed and
     frightened.  There is a long hush.  The old Reverend
     Mother then turns and glares at Paul.

<b>                      PAUL (CONT'D)
</b>               Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking
               into that place where you dare not look.
               You'll find me there staring back at you!!
               You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety
               generations to produce the one person your
               schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I
               will never be yours.

<b>                     REVEREND MOTHER
</b>               Stop him, Jessica!

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Stop him yourself.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               You saw a part of what the race needs in
               the beginning.  In time you perverted the
               truth.  You sought to control human
               breeding and intermix a select few
               according to a selfish master plan.  How
               little you understand.

<b>                     REVEREND MOTHER
</b>               You mustn't speak of...

<b>                          PAUL
</b>                    (using The Voice)
<b>               SILENCE!
</b>
     The old woman is shot backwards by the power of his
     shout.  Her breath is knocked out of her.

<b>                      PAUL (CONT'D)
</b>               I remember your gom jabbar, now you
               remember mine.  I can kill with a word.
<b>--
</b>     A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the
     prophecy.

<b>                       FEDAYKIN #1
</b>               ...and his word shall carry death eternal
               to those who stand against the righteous.

     Feyd hears this and is angered.

<b>                          FEYD
</b>               The righteous!

<b>                          PAUL
</b>                    (to Emperor)
               There is a Harkonnen among you.  Give the
               Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>               If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my
               blade in his hand.

<b>                          FEYD
</b>               I wish it.
                    (steps forward)

<b>                         GURNEY
</b>               This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me,
               please, my Lord.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               The Emperor's blade.

     Feyd takes up the Emperor's blade with a smile.
     Paul takes out his crysknife.  They begin to circle
     each other.

     Paul smiles, circling still.  Suddenly, Feyd leaps,
     his blade jabbing savagely outward, but Paul easily
     evades it, moving away.  They begin to circle again.

     He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously
     close, but again, Paul is away, a frozen smile on
     his face.

<b>                          FEYD
</b>               Why prolong the inevitable?  I will kill
               you!  I will kill him!

     Feyd smiles.  He lashes out biting Paul's hand.
     Feyd LAUGHS in triumph.

     Feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also
     forward.  Yet Paul, although a little slowly, again
     reels away.  Again, Feyd thrusts.
<b>--
</b>     This time Paul jabs with his crysknife, but Feyd
     moves away effortlessly.  Feyd counters and kicks
     Paul to the ground.

<b>                          CHANI
</b>               Paul!

     Paul is up instantly and he circles with Feyd.

<b>                          FEYD
</b>                    (smiling)
               Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps?
               Will she deserve my special attentions?

     Paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing.  Feyd grabs
     his arm, and Paul his, the two men locked in a
     straining clinch.  Feyd presses his right hip closer
     and closer to Paul's body.  Paul strains to keep it
     away.  Suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of Feyd's
     girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges
     powerfully with it at Paul, who just barely misses
     taking it in his skin.  He throws Feyd back, but not
     before Feyd's feet strike out, sending Paul to the
     floor.  Feyd leaps onto him.

<b>                          FEYD
</b>                    (whispering)
               You see... your death... my blade will
               finish you.

     Suddenly, Paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes
     Feyd up and over.  He is on top of him in a flash.

     Paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward
     through Feyd's jaw.  Feyd's mouth opens as the knife
     continues up through his tongue and through to his
     brain.  Feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he
     jerks dead on the floor.  Paul slowly gets to his
     feet, breathing heavily.  Anger still seething in
     him, Paul issues a SOUND -- a loud, horrible,
     powerful sound, and Feyd's internal organs rupture
     and the stone floor under him cracks open.  The
     Fedaykin smile.

<b>                       FEDAYKIN #2
</b>               Usul no longer needs the weirding module.

     Everyone stares in disbelief.  Paul looks to the
     Emperor.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               Now, I will tell you how it will be.
               Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way
               for an Atreides to take the throne.

<b>                         EMPEROR
</b>               I sit on the throne!!
<b>--
</b><b>                          PAUL
</b>               You will sit on a throne on Selusa
               Secundus, your prison planet.  Either that
               or you will die.

     The Emperor is still.  Paul moves to Chani.

<b>                      PAUL (CONT'D)
</b>                    (to Chani)
               The Princess shall have no more of me than
               my name... no child of mine or touch the
               softness of glance... nor instant of
               desire....  This is my promise to you...
                    (whispering)
               ...my love.

     Paul turns back to the others.

     Jessica turns to Chani and whispers to her.

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Think on it Chani... We who carry the name
               of concubine... history will call us
               wives.

     Alia enters with two monks.  She signals and one of
     them places a cloak over Paul's shoulders.

<b>                          PAUL
</b>               The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib.

               the Universe... they will have Arrakis...
               Dune... their planet.  There will be
               flowing water here open to the sky and
               rich green oases.  For the spice there
               will always be some desert.  There will be
               fierce winds and trials to toughen men.
               We Fremen have a saying...
                    (he stares at the Reverend Mother)
               "God created Arrakis to train the
               faithful."
               One cannot go against the word of God.

     Everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly.

<b>                          ALIA
</b>               And how can this be?

     There are three powerful drum hits.

     Paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing
     wind.  Lightning and thunder begin.  Clouds begin to
     form over the Palace.  In the half-light of dusk,
     thousands of Fremen watch the sky.  Giant golden
     lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into
     the sky illuminating the growing clouds.  Five
     tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a
     downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS.  The Fremen stand
     awestruck as they are drenched with water falling
     from the sky.

     WE MOVE through Paul's glowing blue eyes into
     beautiful blue luminescent light.

     A gigantic WIND arises, and suddenly appearing in
     the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like
     gold glass off into infinite.  The blue becomes
     darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the
     night.
