</b>
               Rain. Christmas lights. A rusted out '56 Lincoln rattles 
               down the bleak boulevard. In it: JOE STEVENS, an angry, black 
               man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, JOE 
<b>               JR.
</b>
               Joe Jr. stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings, 
               whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a 
               john, a black Santa, a knot of drinkers. Breaking the silence:

<b>                                     JOE STEVENS
</b>                         Your mother okay?

<b>                                     JOE JR.
</b>                         Yes, sir.

               They stop at a light. Joe Stevens tries to furtively snort a 
               little something. He spots Joe Jr. watching.

<b>                                     JOE STEVENS
</b>                              (firm, without irony)
                         Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't 
                         you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear 
                         me?

               Joe Jr. stares, silent; Joe Jr.'s about to hit him.

<b>                                     JOE STEVENS
</b>                              (continuing)
                         You hear me, goddam it?

               The boy nods. Satisfied, Joe Sr. draws in the stuff. It makes 
               him feel good, strong, worried and determined all at once.

<b>                                     JOE STEVENS
</b>                              (continuing; charged 
                              up)
                         What do you want for Christmas?

<b>                                     JOE JR.
</b>                         I don't know.

</b>                              (light changes; he 
                              accelerates)
                         You don't know?? You gotta know what 
                         you want, boy, if you ever expect to 
                         get it.

               A sudden charm to his bravado. Joe Jr. smiles uncertainly. 
               Joe Sr. grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store.

<b>                                     JOE STEVENS
</b>                              (continuing)
                         Wait here. This won't take a minute.

               Joe Jr. doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father, 
               just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath 
               his coat.

               The boy gazes dreamily at the street. The lunatic Black Santa 
               marches by, ranting to himself ("Then the white man say..."). 
               The RAIN HAMMERS on the roof and windshield. Joe Jr. breathes 
               on the glass, fogging the scene.

               From the store: MUFFLED GUNFIRE.

               Joe Jr. looks that way. Another GUNSHOT, then:

               His father comes out the door clutching money in one hand. 
               He strides toward the car with a reckless pride. He doesn't 
               notice:

               The liquor store door opens behind him.

               A SHOTGUN BLAST. Joe Stevens' guts splatter onto the car 
               windshield. A look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his 
               knees.

<b>                                     JOE JR.
</b>                         Daddy!!

               He jumps from the car, kneels by his father.

               The STORE OWNER (47, Slavic) drags the gun toward them, 
               bleeding profusely.

<b>                                     STORE OWNER
</b>                              (enraged, almost to 
                              tears)
                         Fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers...

<b>               JOE STEVENS
</b>
               looks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's.

<b>                                     JOE STEVENS
</b>                         Fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks.
                              (looks up at his son)
                         I'm sorry...

               He stuffs the blood-soaked bills in the boy's shirt pocket 
               and dies. Joe Jr. looks up at...

<b>               THE STORE OWNER
</b>
               Bloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy 
               who is too frightened to move.

<b>                                     JOE JR.
</b>                         Please, Mister...

               The man dies on his feet. As he falls backward, he pulls the 
               trigger, the BLAST shattering the car windows.

               Cop cars SQUEAL up. Uniformed cops leap out, guns drawn, 
               survey the scene. Then one notices Joe Jr., staring motionless 
               at his father and the store owner, dead together. ON HIS

               -- but older, harder, colder. They're concentrating on a 
               paper before him.

<b>               INT. A ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Thirty-seven Black Cleveland police officers (many in uniform, 
               including Joe) are taking the MMPI. Some roll their eyes at 
               the questions. Some try to copy answers. Others, like Joe, 
               work with rapid concentration.

               But he gets stuck on #4. Marks it false. Erases it. Marks it 
               true. Erases that. Ponders. Goes on to: #5. At times I hear 
               so well it bothers me. (T/F) He marks that true.

<b>               INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</b>
               GERALD CARVER, 36, an ambitious government lawyer with a 
               relaxed, vaguely hip manner, looks over the file of the 
               ingratiating BLACK OFFICER sitting across the desk from him.

</b>                         Officer Leland? You know the 
                         difference between a black man and 
                         nigger?

               Leland is startled, insulted, but doesn't want to blow the 
               interview. He smiles weakly, shakes his head no.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                              (continuing; pleasant 
                              smile)
                         Yeah, most niggers don't.

               Stung, Leland tries to laugh. Carver puts his file aside, 
               picks up another.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                              (continuing)
                         Nice to meet you.

<b>               INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW
</b>
               A SECOND BLACK OFFICER is powerfully built, politically 
               conscious, takes no shit. Carver's leafing through his file.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         So, Winston, what's the difference 
                         between a black man and a nigger?

               Winston is out of his chair before the question is finished, 
               drags Carver by the shirt front halfway across the desk and 
               hisses into his face:

<b>                                     WINSTON
</b>                         Who the fuck do you think you're 
                         talking to?

               Carver smiles cheerfully past Winston's cocked fist.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         Thanks for coming in.

               Nonplussed by this cool dismissal, Winston stalks out. Carver 
               picks up the next file, unfazed.

<b>               INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW
</b>
               Joe Stevens watches Carver reading his file and waiting for 
               an answer. When none is forthcoming, Carver glances up, finds 
               Stevens looking right back at him.

<b>                                     STEVENS
</b>                         The nigger's the one who falls for 
                         your bullshit.

               He says it pleasantly, without belligerence. Carver smiles: 
               he's found his man. He offers his hand.

<b>               INT. A DARKENED ROOM - DAY/NIGHT
</b>
               ON A TV SCREEN: a grainy black-and-white tape, date and time 
               stamped at the bottom. A grungy street, palm trees. The light 
               from the monitor dimly illuminates Carver and Stevens.

               On SCREEN the CAMERA finds: A MAN in jeans, sneakers and 
               sweatshirt on a street corner.

<b>                                     STEVENS
</b>                         He ought to be wearing a sign.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         You can tell he's a cop?

               Stevens laughs: it's obvious.

               A real DRUG DEALER joins the cop. UNDERCOVER COP: "You got 
               it?" DEALER: "In the motel, right over here..." The Cop's 
               uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the CAMERA as they go.

<b>                                     STEVENS
</b>                         He keeps looking for his back-up. 
                         Now, the other guy knows it, too.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         Then why's he taking him to the room?

<b>                                     STEVENS
</b>                              (why else?)
                         To rip him off.

               Carver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed.

               ON SCREEN: The figures disappear into the motel. We hear 
               their voices. DEALER: "Here, try some of it." UNDERCOVER 
               COP: "Uhh... No, I don't..." DEALER: "Why not, you 
               sonofabitch?" Two bursts of SOUND DISTORTION.

               A plainclothes cop, TAFT, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts 
               from behind the CAMERA, sprints toward the motel. The CAMERA 
               wobbles after him.

<b>                                     STEVENS
</b>                              (continuing)
                         Too late.

               ON SCREEN: The CAMERA (jerky, hand-held) nears the open motel 
               door. Taft is bent over the Undercover Cop's body.

                         Get an ambulance -- and back up. 
                         Now!

               He slams the wall, starts past the CAMERA. Carver pushes the 
               pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's 
               face.

                         as they come and twice as honest.

               Carver watches Stevens watch Taft, smiles at something.

               He opens a manila envelope, dumps the contents on the desk:

               transcript, prison records... all in the name of William G.

               Stevens parks outside a small, well-maintained house. As he

               His strictness has already sobered their enthusiasm. Sensing 
               this, he attempts to embrace them which he can do only 
               awkwardly.

               Meanwhile, his wife, TERRY (Southern white) has come out the 
               screen door. She and Stevens bristle at each other.

</b>                         On the day of the King's castration, 
                         all the counts and no accounts were 
                         down on the deck with Georgia Tech 
                         taking turns in the back seat...

               Those dealers not at car windows, gather around. He never 
               speaks to them, goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for 
               money.

               Hull watches, talking to another street person. His appearance 
               continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly 
               conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig. Throughout the 
               film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with. We 
               always recognize him, but each time he's different.

               He walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going. 
               But he sees them and is seen.

<b>               INT. AN OFFICE - NIGHT

               Hull drops eleven foil balls on a green blotter. Carver counts 
               out money for him.

               He sits at the window, eating a burrito, watching little

               Hull approaches another Dealer, the 13-year-old seen earlier 
               (angelic face). Like Hull, he's trying to act tough.

                         Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent 
                         shit.

               Hull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls. He walks 
               off. He has gone twenty feet when...

<b>               RED RANGE ROVER

               SQUEALS to a stop opposite the Dealer.

               A huge young black man, IVY (23, all in red with a red 
               headband), leans out the passenger window, shouting at the 
               13-year-old.

                         here?

               Everyone turns to look, but Hull's view is blocked.

               POPPING noises. Ivy is waving an automatic weapon. Everyone 
               on the street but Hull has hit the ground.

                         Get down, motherfuckers!

               Ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car ROARS off. He 
               sees Hull, pretends to fire, laughs as Hull, too, ducks. 
               When Ivy's gone, he runs to where a CROWD has gathered 
               around...

<b>               THE 13-YEAR-OLD
</b>
               lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open. 
               He twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound. 
               Then he's dead. The faces around him (young, old, many races) 
               watch with a variety of emotions.

                         Get his beeper...

               Cops push through to the body. As the crowd disperses, Hull 
               can't take his eyes off the boy. When he finally does, he 
               sees Eddie, drink in hand. Their eyes meet, and Eddie, a 
               rapper, raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow.

               A bar with a neon bird for a sign. Hull enters.

<b>               INT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT
</b>
               A racial mix. Hull takes a seat at the bar. Stuffed birds 
               line the lintel above the bottles. A female BARTENDER (long 
               red nails) greets him familiarly.

               Without being asked, she sets him up a Dry Sack with a long 
               red straw. (NOTE: He never touches the drink.) Hull's 
               appearance has continued to change. His clothes have become 
               flashier, he has an earring, the start of a goatee.

               Eddie approaches the bar compulsively reciting one of his 
               toasts.

               He goes on muttering under his breath, tapping his foot like 
               any crankhead. He notices Hull, greets him as someone he 
               can't place but knows he's seen around.

               Clasp hands. Eddie takes his drinks, carries them to...

<b>               A TABLE
</b>
               where he rejoins a white man, DAVID ELIAS (30s, slick, 
               powerful) and a well-dressed BLACK WOMAN (mid-20s, good-
               looking). She gets the wine.

               Elias rises to let her out. As the woman passes Hull on her 
               way to the restrooms, their eyes meet: an instant of perfect 
               chemistry. He's struck. Her features open, grow sensual for 
               a moment, but then, as if seeing something she doesn't like, 
               her eyes flick away, and she walks by as if he weren't there.

<b>               INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               city. This simple regularity suggest visits to a psychiatrist, 
               Carver probing, testing, teasing, trying to draw Hull out. 
               And they feel like therapy, at once a respite and a torment.)

               More foil balls on the blotter beside boxes of 3x5 
               photographs. Photos of Eddie and David Elias are up on a 
               corkboard, the beginning of a pyramid.

                         something. But I haven't seen him.

               Carver produces a photo of a handsome Latin in his 50s, pins 
               it on the board above Elias.

               Carver shrugs: these things happen. He hands Hull a lot of 
               cash, much more than expected. Hull does understand.

               Virtual darkness save splinters of light between the curtains. 
               Pipes burn here and there in the gloom. Ten or fifteen 
               crackheads huddle around a battery-operated TV on which Tom 
               Brokaw is narrating an NBC documentary on drugs. A 12-year-
               old sits against a wall too stoned even for television.

               Hull approaches Eddie, regally installed on an automobile 
               bench seat-cum-sofa, a lit pipe in one hand. We barely notice 
               the redhead kneeling between his legs, face buried in his 
               crotch. He greets Hull from wrecked bliss. They know each 
               other now.

               Hull greets Eddie, some of the others, drops familiarly onto 
               an adjacent auto seat. The patrons are making fun of Brokaw,

               Eddie holds up a hand telling Hull to wait. His mind is 
               elsewhere. His features contract in brief concentration.

               More laughter, etc. Eddie's concentration peaks, breaks off 
               into a sigh and a smile.

               Eddie sings a satisfied little song...

               The redhead rises from Eddie's crotch, and we see it's a 
               boy, seventeen going on death; he might have been pretty a 
               year ago.

               Eddie passes him the crack pipe, lets him suck greedily for

               and offering it to Hull, who, with a grimace that gets laughs,

               In all these scenes, Hull acts indifferent to the horror,

               Three men: FELIX BARBOSA (whose photo we saw in Carver's 
               office). Barbosa is a veteran of the coke business, but he's 
               doing too much of the drug now; he's sweating, paranoid, 
               unstable. With him is GOPHER, early 60s, a wizened high-voiced 
               old con who Barbosa keeps the way Spanish kings kept dwarfs, 
               for amusement and luck; like the court jester, Gopher can 
               say anything he wants without fear. Behind them is an Hispanic 
               kid, CHINO, 17, a thug.

               Elias knows them all, but is not happy to see them at his

               A handful of customers under a mud sky. The THROB of a distant 
               helicopter. Hull pulls into the lot beside Eddie's BMW.

               He climbs into the BMW, tosses Eddie a brown envelope; money 
               spills onto his lap. Eddie does a quick count, produces the 
               Fed Ex envelope. The usual white stuff.

               Hull's about to taste when the chopper swoops in with a sudden 
               blinding overhead light. A BULLHORN booms down like the voice 
               of God.

               Eddie starts the car, and Hull rolls out the passenger door 
               as the BMW races across the lot.

               Two black-and-whites and an unmarked converge on the stand.

               Hull can't reach his car. He vaults a metal rail and runs 
               off between two buildings.

               Hernandez jumps out of an unmarked and races after him. Taft 
               speeds the car out onto the street.

               running. Police and SIRENS pursuing. He hurls the Fed Ex 
               envelope into a dumpster. HELICOPTER light sweeps over him.

               As he cuts around a building, Taft opens a car door right 
               into his face. Hull goes down hard.

               He waves at the helicopter which goes away, kneels over Hull

               Hull groans, twists in pain. Taft sticks the pictures in his 
               face. Hull is affected by the children despite everything.

               Hull is led in with other handcuffed PRISONERS. Carver is 
               here, catches Hull's eye. Hull shakes his head; doesn't want

               plunges it into Barbosa's neck.

               As if it were a fly bite, Barbosa flings the table aside 
               and, with a long knife already in his hand, guts Eddie from

               Elias can't help gasping.

               Miranda gives Hull a shy greeting. Nancy hurries into the 
               kitchen, handsome, busy, ready for work.

               Nancy nods briefly in Hull's direction. Elias kisses Miranda 
               who grabs the back-pack her mother proffers, and they go 
               out. When they're gone:

               washer/dryer, takes a sports bag off a shelf, gives it to

               BETTY STONE, the woman Hull saw with Elias at the bar, comes

               way she thinks a banker who went to Vassar dresses for 
               success. She's also a little strung out.

               She and Hull recognize each other at once, (a brief reprise

               She produces a vial of coke, looks questioningly at Elias.

               She draws out six lines. Elias does two.

</b>                         No, thanks.

               NOTE: Betty is acutely attuned to Hull, and in his refusal 
               she senses -- albeit unconsciously -- two things: first, 
               that he doesn't trust himself on drugs, therefore, he's a 
               dangerous guy and, therefore, exciting; and, second, more 
               important, the refusal bespeaks a repudiation of the violence 
               and danger and, thus, a longing for goodness. Despite the 
               seeming contradiction, she finds this even more attractive. 
               But because she feels herself to be bad, his goodness seems 
               only a judgment against her, and so she thinks she hates 
               him.

               Betty ignores him, does her lines.

                         is the cure.

               She can't help looking at Hull who's looking at her. She and 
               Elias are stoned; he's not.

               He sticks his finger in Hull's face just like Hull with the 
               boys.

               Hull glares; Elias refuses to be intimidated.

               Elias dances around repeating "fucka" until it's almost 
               musical.

               Hull picks him up and slams into a wall.

</b>                         Say it again, and I'll kill you.

               Elias throws Hull back against a display case. He's strong 
               and unafraid. They're ready to fight.

               This half snaps them out of it. Still glowering, they slowly 
               relax, release each other.

<b>               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Hull sits in the Trans Am eating a sandwich and watching the 
               street as a DEALER leans in the window telling his sob story. 
               There's an authority to Hull's manner that tells us he may 
               not like this job, but he knows how to do it.

               As he raps on, comical pathos, Hull spots in his side 
               mirror...

<b>               THE RED RANGE ROVER
</b>
               coming slowly this way. Ivy in the passenger window, the 
               barrel of an automatic weapon glinting in the streetlight.

               Hull glances up: Bijoux is selling on the next corner.

               The Range Rover passes the Trans Am. Ivy leans out.

               Hull flings open the Trans Am door, throwing the Dealer to 
               the ground. He jumps from the car:

                         Bijoux!!

               She turns. Sees Ivy. She puts out her hands to block the 
               shots. The SOUND of the gun is inaudible. The barrel bounces 
               slightly. Bijoux sprawls backward.

               Bijoux: dead on the sidewalk, limbs askew, bleeding from 
               many wounds.

               Hull, standing over her, covers her face.

<b>               EXT. SAME - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT

               The body has been taken away, the crowd has cleared. Elias 
               sits on the hood of the Trans Am. Hull stands, staring down.

               Elias knows that's true, and it leads to another truth.

               Hull sees the truth of that and slowly nods.

<b>               EXT. STREET/INT. ELIAS'S CAR - NIGHT

               Hull and Elias driving, looking for Ivy. Elias double parks 
               by two prostitutes.

               We STAY in the car with Hull who's silent, frightened, keeps 
               trying to warm his hands.

               Outside, Elias is talking and laughing with the prostitutes. 
               We see them point. He gives them money, kisses. They laugh. 
               He gets back in the car.

<b>               EXT. A DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

               The Range Rover parked in front. Elias's car stops. MUSIC 
               pounds from inside. Then one CONTINUOUS SHOT:

               They pass the club, other store fronts... Turn at the 
               corner... Turn into an alley... Down the alley past the same 
               buildings... The rear door of the club... To the next 
               street... Turn... Turn... onto the original street, back to 
               the front of the club. They stop again.

               Elias nods. A beat. They look at each other.

</b>                         I want to see you in that alley.

               Hull's so terrified he seems calm. With an air of submitting 
               himself to fate, he gets out and walks into the club.

<b>               INT. CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
               Crowded and BOOMING and strobe lit. Hull pays the cover and 
               climbs a staircase to a...

<b>               CIRCULAR BALCONY
</b>
               that overlooks the dance floor. On stage: a RAP ACT with its 
               throbbing beat and below Hull a sea of dancers.

               Hull circles the balcony. It isn't hard to pick out Ivy -- 
               he's all in red, dancing with the woman we saw him with in 
               the Range Rover the first time.

               Hull reaches the steps again and starts down, keeping his 
               eye on Ivy. The number ends. In the pause before the next 
               one, Ivy can be seen excusing himself, heading toward the 
               rear of the club.

               The next number begins. People dance. Hull pushes his way 
               through the dancers to...

<b>               INT. REAR OF CLUB - A SHORT HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               leading toward the rear door they saw from the alley.

<b>               MOVING DOWN THE HALL
</b>
               A woman's room. A men's room. Hull goes into...

<b>               INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Ivy is pissing into a urinal. He's so huge he seems to take 
               up all the space in the tiny room. Hull stares at him, unable 
               to look away.

               He notices Hull. All dialogue is UNDER the POUNDING MUSIC.

               Hull stares at Ivy's face. Ivy considers this rude.

                         Or drink it?

               Laughing, he turns, urinates on Hull's pants. Hull doesn't 
               move.

               Ivy starts to draw it out.

               Hull steps forward, grabs Ivy's gun arm. With his other hand 
               he clumsily pulls a silenced .22 from inside his jacket, 
               puts it in the underside of Ivy's jaw and SHOOTS twice. Ivy's 
               brains spray upward onto the wall, and he slides straight to

               see Hull go down three steps, stumble in the drive and fall 
               to his knees, the gun CLATTERING away from him.

               A couple that had been making out, stops, looks.

               It takes Hull a moment to gather himself. He picks up the

               With a knife, he draws out something hidden inside the wooden

               The rat reaches this second destination, pushes a bar, is

               animal, replaces it at the start. It runs the same route.

               Embarrassed, she looks away. He takes her hand, and at his 
               touch something yields to her. She lets him draw her to him. 
               His kiss is strangely tender, searching. It turns Betty on

               all over her, but she pulls back for a moment. There is a

                         turn. First to four wins, like the 
                         World Series.

               Elias covers Barbosa's palms with his own.

               ON THE HANDS: Barbosa tenses his hands. Elias yanks back. 
               Barbosa's hands haven't moved.

               He slaps Elias across the face. Hull starts forward. A knife 
               appears. He stops.

                         Again, shmuck.

               Elias covers Barbosa's hands. Barbosa tenses. Elias holds 
               firm, and Barbosa quickly slaps both hands, hard. Elias 
               doubles over, holding his hands in pain.

               He slaps him again, a stinging crack. Elias looks to Hull, 
               but they're across a canyon. Hull lowers his eyes.

               ON THE HANDS. Barbosa moves his hands a millimeter, and Elias 
               flinches again. Barbosa smacks him across the face. The sound 
               reverberates through the room. Now even Gopher is silent. 
               Tears run from Elias's eyes, blood from his mouth, but he 
               doesn't move.

<b>               A MAN

               steps forward out of the shadows. He is young, mid-30's, 
               handsome, European features, beautifully dressed, accompanied 
               by a guard we'll know as MOLTO. Someone murmurs to someone 
               else:

               Barbosa shakes his head, ashamed now in front of Gallegos.

                         Four was the match.

               He holds out his hands. Barbosa resumes the stance, then 
               waits, waits, waits, and finally brings both hands down, 
               terribly hard, the sound of the slap is awful.

               Hull leads Elias to the door right past Gallegos. Their gazes 
               meet again. As they go out they hear Gallegos BERATING Barbosa 
               in furious Spanish.

<b>               INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

               Trembling, Elias holds his bloody hands against his chest, 
               as Hull leads him in silence down the steps.

</b>                         Look at me. Look at me, damn it!

               He barely whispers, but it's like a shout. Hull, who'd been 
               avoiding his gaze, forces himself to look. Elias's humiliation 
               is so profound it almost ennobles him. Finally:

                         them, and I never will be. That they 
                         don't respect me. That I don't deserve

                         I'm a shmuck...

               He laughs a terrible laugh. The door behind them opens, and 
               Barbosa appears with Gopher. Everyone is ready for death, 
               but:

                         forget about it.

               He comes down the stairs, offers his hand. Elias will never 
               forget about it, but he silently takes the hand, holds them 
               in his own bloody paws, looking directly into Barbosa's face.

               Barbosa becomes uneasy, manages to extract his hand. Elias 
               and Hull continue down and out the door. Gopher gushes to 
               Barbosa.

               Hernandez comes out of a bodega with groceries, wine and a 
               woman. He nuzzles her as he lets her into his car. As he's 
               getting behind the wheel, Molto (Gallegos' guard) stops the 
               door from closing. The conversation is entirely in SPANISH.

               Then she looks closer and sees not murder in his face, but 
               need. She opens the door. Without a word, he gathers her to 
               him. She can't resist him now. Her mouth is everywhere on 
               him.

               Betty gasping in the wake of pleasure, turning her face away

               He laughs. They begin to make love again. Suddenly: AN EXTRA 
               HAND stroking Betty's hair. She gasps. A gun in Hull's ear. 
               Another in her face. Guns all around.

               RAMON GALLEGOS lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave. 
               He kneels, whispers a prayer, crosses himself.

               He rises and walks to where Molto and the other guards hold 
               Hull and Elias. Gallegos is in his thirties, more European 
               than Barbosa. He has a distinctly mild manner.

               An impudent question, but Elias seems strangely bright-eyed 
               despite the guns held on him.

</b>                         My wife's. She died of leukemia three

                              (turning to them)
                         Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny 
                         fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee 
                         businessman in Bogata hotels. He 
                         grew up. He made himself strong and 
                         rich, but getting there made him 
                         sick, and that killed him. So he 
                         lost everything for the same reason 
                         he'd gotten it in the first place. 
                         Now we'll see if you can do as well.

               A PRIEST going by greets Gallegos who responds warmly. They 
               chat a minute in SPANISH. The Priest leaves.

                         Felix owed me one million eight 
                         hundred thousand dollars.

               He addresses this to Hull; Elias feels left out.

                         When you killed him, you bought the 
                         debt; now you owe it to me; you get 
                         to keep thirty percent, like he did. 
                         You have three days.

                         have killed him.

               He notices Hull's earring: two tiny dice, the spots made of 
               minuscule jewels. Unembarrassed, he fingers it.

                         Cute... Can I have that?

               Without waiting for an answer, he yanks it out of Hull's ear 
               and walks away, leaving Hull bleeding through his fingers 
               before a stone cross.

               A club on the corner. THROUGH A WINDOW we see a RAP ACT on

               pulls up in a Jaguar. He and Elias go through a door adjacent 
               to the club.

<b>               INT. BUILDING HALL/INT. GOPHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The MUSIC is still audible here, though muffled. Elias and

               Elias kicks it open, and they enter Gopher's tiny, miserable 
               domain. He's wearing some sort of negligee and an immense 
               naked woman fills his bed. We still hear the MUFFLED MUSIC.

               A well-dressed lawyer (30's) talking with clients, a 
               distinguished couple in their 60's.

               The door BANGS open and a secretary is unable to restrain 
               Hull and Elias as they charge into the room. The lawyer is 
               up on his feet, but Hull shoves him around as Elias politely 
               explains to the clients that this will only take a moment.

               A Technicolor Spanish melodrama is winding to its lurid end. 
               A door in back opens, and a burst of daylight reveals Hull 
               and Elias being brought in by a guard and met by Molto.

               Molto and the guard frisk them, take their guns and money 
               satchels, make them wait a moment until...

               The movie ends.

               The house lights come on revealing Ramon Gallegos as the 
               only spectator in the theater. He beckons. Molto and the 
               guard bring Hull and Elias down the aisle to him.

               Gallegos looking in the satchels. A tense moment.

               of paper, hands it to the guard who feeds it into a fax 
               machine.

                         was because I met a man I loved and

                         confirm everything, of course. Do 
                         you have a sample of the product?

               Elias produces one. Guzman gestures to Molto. Molto samples 
               it. Molto's eyes widen.

               Elias hands him a key, points to a different Winnebago. Molto 
               takes the key, unlocks the back: money. He signals okay to 
               Guzman.

               Suddenly: SIRENS. Police cars wail into the garage. The THWACK-
               THWACK and sweeping light of a helicopter descend toward the 
               roof (though we never see the copter).

               Everybody scatters. The garage is a labyrinth of cement 
               stairwells, ramps, hundreds of RVs to hide between, under 
               and so forth... Lots of NOISE, lights, but mostly we see 
               Hull and Elias dodging here, avoiding the action.

<b>               INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARAGE - NIGHT

               Molto caught between the lights. He draws his gun. GUNFIRE. 
               He's cut down.

               Cars with rotating dome lights, but not many cops.

               Hull and Elias emerge from a shadowy doorway and make their 
               way at a casual pace beyond the perimeter of police cars, 
               quickly mingling with other spectators. They continue down...

<b>               EXT. A QUIET SIDE STREET - NIGHT

               In one motion, Elias draws his gun, turns and FIRES.

               The figure goes down. Elias can't believe he hit him.

               Hull starts toward the figure.

               Hull tries to hold closed the wound. The posture duplicates 
               Hull with his dying father. He feels for a pulse. For breath.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         That's the drug game. Plus a change... 
                         I want you to come back to work for 
                         me. You'll beat all charges on a 
                         technicality and go back to who you 
                         were.

<b>                                     HULL
</b>                         Who was I, Ger?

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         Does anyone really know?

<b>                                     HULL
</b>                         I have other things to do.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         Like travel? Tangiers, maybe?

               Hull looks at him; how did he know?

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                              (continuing)
                         I'm God, remember?

               He beckons him. He walks him over to a cell. Through a one-
               way window they see:

<b>               BETTY
</b>
               alone in the cell, unaware she's being watched.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         Go back to work, she walks out of 
                         here. Otherwise, she's up on multiple 
                         counts, and I'll see to it the judge 
                         runs them consecutively.

               Hull just looks at him. Carver shrugs apologetically.

<b>               INT. ANOTHER ROOM
</b>
               Absolutely white. Not a window, not a stick of furniture. 
               The only deviation is Hull in prison blues.

               The door opens, Betty comes in wearing prison yellows. She 
               sits on a nearly invisible chair. They know they're being 
               watched.

</b>                         They want me to testify against you. 
                         I said I wouldn't.

<b>                                     HULL
</b>                         You have to. It's all set up. That's 
                         how you're getting off.

               She shakes her head in cynical understanding. How difficult 
               it is to get back to an honorable life.

               He takes her hand.

<b>                                     HULL
</b>                              (continuing; with 
                              difficulty)
                         My father didn't have a heart attack.

               She looks at him.

</b>                              (continuing)
                         He was shot robbing a liquor store. 
                         Trying to rob it. I lied about that.

</b>                         Baby, why are you telling me this?

<b>                                     HULL
</b>                         I had to start somewhere... There're 
                         other things you don't know...

<b>               AN IRIS SHOT - HULL AND BETTY
</b>
               Silent. Kissing. Beginning to make love. Hull extracts 
               himself, gives the finger to the POV and stuffs a bit of 
               tissue in the iris, blocking our view.

<b>               EXT. ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Carver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole.

<b>               EXT. A CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
               A funeral. Taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo) 
               leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party.

               When everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave. From his 
               pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father 
               gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that 
               already cover the plot.

               He's silent a moment, then he gets up. He joins Carver who's 
               standing with Hull's children. The kids each take his hand, 
               they walk together.

</b>                         Betty walked out of court free this 
                         morning. That's my side of the deal.

<b>                                     HULL
</b>                              (to the children)
                         You two run on ahead.

               They do. Hull watches them go.

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         Her probation gets revoked the minute 
                         you fuck up. I want you to stay away 
                         from her altogether.

<b>                                     HULL
</b>                         You know the difference between a 
                         black man and a nigger?

               Carver smiles, shakes his head. He likes a good joke. Hull 
               punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.

<b>                                     HULL
</b>                              (continuing)
                         The nigger's the one who'd even think 
                         about doing what you tell him.

               He walks away. Still on his knees, doubled over, Carver 
               whispers after him:

<b>                                     CARVER
</b>                         Don't blow your cover.

<b>               FADE OUT.

<b>                                         THE END
