<b>1   INT. FLORIDA COURTROOM - DAY                                  1
</b>
    Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air
    conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is
    full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an
    efficient man with a good case.

    The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a
    witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been
    carefully rehearsed.

<b>                             BARBARA
</b>               ... we go back to our homeroom for
               dismissal, unless you have a pass
               for sports or something.

<b>                             PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
</b>               And is that what you did on the
               day in question?

<b>                            BARBARA
</b>               No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay
               after class.

<b>                             PROSECUTOR
</b>               What happened next, Barbara?

<b>                             BARBARA
</b>               Mr. Gettys closed the door.

<b>                             PROSECUTOR
</b>               Everyone else had gone?

<b>                             BARBARA
</b>               Yes. He told me to sit in the
               chair beside his desk.

    MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of
    respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly
    enduring this testimony.

<b>                               PROSECUTOR
</b>                 In your own words, Barbara, can
                 you tell us exactly what happened
                 during the next few minutes?

    KEVIN LOMAX.    Defense counsel.   Taking it all in.

<b>                               BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>                 I told him I was afraid I would
                 miss my bus. He promised I would
                 get to the bus on time if I would
                 help him to do something...

    Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom --
    taking inventory -- assessing damage --

<b>                               BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>                 ... Then he put -- before I could
                 say anything -- he placed his hand
                 inside my blouse...

    Kevin -- checking the jury and --

<b>                               BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>                 ... I was so frightened I didn't
                 move. I thought if I was just
                 quiet it would be okay...

    Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops
    him cold --

<b>                               BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>                 ... Then his other hand went up
                 under -- inside my skirt...

    Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one
    but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly
    feeling their way along the leg of his chair --

<b>                               BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>                 ... his hand then, it started, he
                 started, moving back and forth --
                 farther and farther inside my
                 skirt...

    Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --

<b>                               BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>                 ... he said he was testing to see
                 if I had any special feelings,
                 that he wanted to find out what
                 kind of feelings I had...

    Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg --
    absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual --

<b>                               BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>                 ... I didn't know what to say, I
                 was trying to think of something
                 to say but I was confused and he
                 just kept on -- with his hand --
                 moving it -- under my dress --
                 higher and higher...

    Kevin is rocked.    Trying not to show it.

<b>                               BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>                 ... then I, I was asking him to
                 stop but it was like he couldn't
                 hear me -- he just kept on --

    Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving --

<b>                               BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>                 -- and then I screamed...

    Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him.
    Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been
    caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and --

<b>                               BARBARA
</b>                 ... then he, he got mad and said
                 we would have to try again
                 sometime.

<b>                               PROSECUTOR
</b>                 And did he try again?

<b>                                BARBARA
</b>                 Not with me.

<b>                               PROSECUTOR
</b>                 With friends of yours?

<b>                                BARBARA
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                               PROSECUTOR
</b>                 And when you told them what he had
                 done to you, they told you what he
                 had done to them, isn't that true?

<b>                                BARBARA

</b>                 I have nothing further.

    right on his heels.

</b>                 Lloyd, as your attorney, I'm

</b>                 You're my lawyer! You're here to

    Behind him, the door opens.     A local REPORTER enters,
    moves to the urinal.

<b>                               REPORTER
</b>                 Well, hell, there you are. Rumor
                 was you were out wandering in

                 need a quote. Gimme a quote.

<b>                                KEVIN

<b>                               REPORTER
</b>                 'Mr. Lomax had no comment on
                 today's events. Speculation,
                 however, was widespread that the
                 young lawyer's unblemished string
                 of victories would come to an end
                 in this courtroom.'

    Kevin pulls some cold water to his face. Startled, as
    THUNDER EXPLODES overhead -- then just as suddenly,
    becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing...

</b>                That's a veal roast, Your Honor.
                U.S.D.A. approved and stamped.
                Eight days ago, in Kansas City,
                two men pushed a calf into a steel
                frame as a third man fired a high-
                voltage staple-gun into the
                animal's skull. Men kill animals
                and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez
                killed a goat. He killed a goat.
                And he did it at home, in a manner
                consistent with his religious
                beliefs. Now some people may find
                it bizarre.

                  is transformed into blood. It's

</b>
      Packed. JUDGE ARMAND POE presiding. Cullen seated with
      Kevin and Pam. The jury in their box. And prosecutor FRANK
      BROYGO on his feet, just wrapping up his opening statement --

<b>                               BROYGO
</b>                 ... And when all that evidence is
                 laid before you, when all these
                 pieces weave together, you will
                 conclude -- you will know -- that
                 Alexander Cullen is guilty of
                 murdering three people in cold
                 blood with malice aforethought.

      Done.   The courtroom is silent.   The jury liked him.

<b>                               JUDGE POE
</b>                 Mr. Lomax...

<b>                               JUDGE POE
</b>                 Proceed.

<b>                               KEVIN
</b>                 We just spent our morning listening
                 to Mr. Broygo talk about his
                 'evidence'. What he neglected to
                 tell you is what this case is
                 really about. He left out the most
                 important fact of all: Alex Cullen
                 was somewhere else when these
                 murders took place. Now, Alex
                 Cullen has done a lot of things I
                 don't like. He's been a terrible
                 husband to all three of his wives.
                 He's been a destructive force in
                 the lives of his step-children.
                 He's cheated the city. His partners.
                 His employees. He's paid hundreds of
                 thousands of dollars in penalties and
                 fines over the years. I don't like
                 those things. I don't expect you to
                 like them. There will be other things
                 during the course of this trial that
                 you will hear about and like even
                 less. But this isn't a popularity
                 contest. It's a murder trial and
                 Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.

      Kevin turns to see Christabella standing beside him.
      Jackie's concerned expression blossoms into a private,
      knowing smile now that Kevin has turned away.
      Christabella squeezes in, as the MUSIC SWELLS and THE
      PRIEST walks solemnly to the altar. Kevin caught in a
      high-intensity sexual cross-fire between Jackie and
      Christabella. He's tense. He's flipping out.

       But someplace completely different. Older.        Dark.   Empty.
       Echoey. A fluorescent bulb sputtering out.

       FOOTSTEPS approaching...

       It's Kevin. And we know instantly that Mary Ann is dead.
       There's blood on his shirt. His eyes are raw. At his
       side, a small suitcase containing her personal effects.
       More than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is
       his frighteningly grim determination.

       Up ahead, a bench. Mrs. Lomax huddled here. Cried out.
       Empty. Holding herself more tightly as he sets down the
       suitcase.

</b>                    I could've packed that up for you.

       Kevin sits.    If he loses his steel he'll drown.

                   Nineteen-sixty-four. You're in
                   New York. There's a waiter in a
                   restaurant.
                          (waiting)
                   Finish the story.

<b>                                 MRS. LOMAX
</b>                   He talked to me. Nobody'd ever
                   really talked to me before. Sixteen
                   years old, a thousand miles away
                   from home, somebody takes an
                   interest... Working so hard,
                   putting himself through school,
                   I'd never met anybody like that.
                   Knew the Bible, every word, just
                   knew it by heart. Every meal,
                   there he was, at my ear and I
                   just... I didn't want that week to
                   ever end. But it did. He came to
                   say goodbye, it was late, and I
                   started to cry and he said not to
                   worry, 'Behold, I send you out as
                   sheep amidst the wolves.' And that
                   just stopped me cold because we'd
                   spent that whole day at Bible study
                   reading Matthew Ten and there was
                   just no way for him to know about
                   that, so I was... I took it as a
                   sign. I let him in. And then
                   everything was different. He was
                   cruel. He was so cruel and I was
                   so ashamed, I thought I'd die...

      Kevin's eyes settle on the suitcase.      Mary Ann...

                   was a reason this terrible thing
                   had happened. There had to be a

                Every day? What training. What

                   until it looks like a vandalized,
                   neon sign! And while God is busy
                   at his peephole -- as he deigns us
                   with his disapproval -- as he
                   lumbers around his empty kingdom
                   like some overfed colonial governor --
                   as God sleeps late, we will win.
