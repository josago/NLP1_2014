                         He walks jauntily to a desk, refers 
                         to his paper, points his finger to a 
                         woman, emits a short whistle through

                         throat and jerks his thumb toward managing 
                         editor's office. The woman stares starkly 
                         at him while her immediate neighbors 
                         look on with sympathy. The office boy 
                         now goes through the same procedure 
                         with several other people. All watch

                         then I haven't been able to get another 
                         one. At first I was sore at the state 
                         administration because it's on account 
                         of the slimy politics here we have all 
                         this unemployment. But in looking around, 
                         it seems the whole world's going to 
                         pot, so in protest I'm going to commit 
                         suicide by jumping off the City Hall

                         I yelled over to him "Good morning,

                         his fender, and was I burned! So I turned 
                         around to give my wife a dirty look 
                         and she said, "Louder, louder. He didn't 
                         hear you." So, in a voice you could

                         a big smile, came over and took my hand

                         hunger and more hate. And what's to 
                         prevent that from starting all over 
                         again? Nobody knows the answer to that

                         slimy, bolloxed-up theories you've got! 
                         The John Doe idea may be the answer, 
                         though! It may be the one thing capable 
                         of saving this cockeyed world! Yet you 
                         sit back there on your fat hulks and 
                         tell me you'll kill it if you can't
