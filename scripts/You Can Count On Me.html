               The shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the 
               faces of MR. and MRS. PRESCOTT, a pleasant-looking couple in 
               their late thirties, dressed up for a night out. Mr. Prescott 
               drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway.

                         teenage girls at the exact moment 
                         when they're the most self-conscious 
                         about their appearance?

               UP AHEAD, near the top of the oncoming hill, a RED PICKUP 
               TRUCK is poking its nose out of the short exit lane.

               The PICKUP LURCHES into the road, with not nearly enough 
               time to spare.

               Mr. Prescott's FOOT STOMPS on the BRAKE. We BLACK OUT and 
               there is the SOUND of a terrible CRASH.

<b>               EXT. THE PRESCOTTS' FRONT DOOR. NIGHT
</b>
               The SHADOW of a big man looms up onto the front door. A big 
               finger RINGS the BELL.

               A moment.

               AMY, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the 
               door and looks up. In the b.g. we see TWO CHILDREN, SAMMY 
               (Samantha) and TERRY PRESCOTT, in their pajamas, lying on 
               their stomachs in the living room, watching television. Sammy 
               is eleven. Terry is eight.

               REVERSE: DARRYL, the SHERIFF, a portly fellow with glasses 
               and a mustache, looks down at AMY.

               AMY closes the door and looks expectantly up at Darryl. Darryl 
               doesn't know how to start.

<b>               EXT. CHURCH. DAY
</b>
               CREDITS BEGIN OVER a blustery April day. The steeple of the 
               little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky.

<b>               INT. TOWN CHURCH. DAY
</b>
               It's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full. 
               There's a CHOIR of mostly SENIOR CITIZENS arrayed in the 
               back. TWO CLOSED CASKETS are laid out in front of the 
               MINISTER, a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and-
               pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy MOS.

               Among the mourners in the second row sit Terry and Sammy, 
               both redeyed, and uncomfortable in their dress-up clothes. 
               Their Aunt Ruth, a pinch-faced woman in her forties, sits 
               next to them.

               Sammy and Terry are holding hands tightly. Terry wipes his 
               eyes with his free hand.

               The Minister addresses her remarks to the children. Sammy is 
               hanging on the Minister's every word; Terry is shifting his 
               eyes and his seat as if it will kill him to sit still another 
               minute.

<b>               EXT. SCOTTSVILLE CEMETERY. SIXTEEN YEARS LATER. DAY
</b>
               On the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green 
               country, SAMMY, twenty-seven years old now, puts flowers on 
               her parents' graves with quick, practiced movements.

               She is a nice-looking young woman of a neat appearance, saved 
               from primness by an elusive, pleasantly flustered quality. 
               An unsuccessfully neat person. She is dressed in office 
               clothes -- white blouse, dark skirt, high heels, light 
               raincoat over everything. She picks out a couple of weeds 
               and then bows her head and closes her eyes.

<b>               EXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY
</b>
               Scottsville is a small town. Main Street. Run-down old stores 
               next to a new bank, a couple of chain stores, a few 
               restaurants of varying ambitions. Civil War statue. World 
               War I statue. World War II statue. Residential streets 
               wandering away from Main Street up and down hills. You know 
               there's a minimall somewhere nearby. A fair amount of activity 
               during the daytime.

               SAMMY'S CAR pulls up across the street from where an eight-
               year-old BOY in a secondhand baseball jacket and a school 
               knapsack is waiting at the curb. This is her son, RUDY. SAMMY 
               calls out the car window.

</b>                         Rudy, come on! I'm really late!

               Rudy hurries across the street and gets in the car, slinging 
               his knapsack into the backseat.

                         tell us what it's supposed to be 
                         about.

</b>                         Nothing. I just think it's

                         Well, I'm sure you'll be able to 
                         think of something. If you can't, 
                         I'll help you.

<b>               INT./EXT. CAR/CAROL'S HOUSE. DAY
</b>
               Sammy stops the car outside a heavily THICKETED DRIVEWAY 
               (CAROL'S HOUSE), and RUDY gets out.

</b>                         Don't forget your backpack.

               Rudy returns to take his knapsack out of the back.

</b>                         It's not a backpack, it's a knapsack.

</b>                         Don't forget your knapsack.

               Rudy hoists his knapsack out of the back.

</b>                         Give me a kiss.

               Rudy gives her a kiss and puts his arms around her and 
               squeezes her neck.

               He withdraws, slams the door. As Sammy DRIVES AWAY, he slogs 
               up the long twisting driveway.

<b>               EXT. MERCHANTS NATIONAL TRUST -- PARKING LOT. DAY

               Sammy gets out of her car, which is parked in one of the 
               half dozen spaces in the little parking lot allocated for 
               bank employees.

               She hurries toward the employees' entrance, fixing her skirt 
               as she goes.

<b>               INT. MERCHANTS NATIONAL TRUST. DAY

               Sammy hurries down the clean hallway in the back past MABEL, 
               a pleasant-faced fellow employee.

<b>                                     MABEL

</b>                         Oh no, really?

               Mabel nods and passes by.

               SAMMY KNOCKS on a big door that says "Manager" and has half 
               the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off 
               it.

               Sammy swings open the door. BRIAN EVERETT, the new branch 
               manager, is unpacking a box. Sammy is surprised to see he is 
               in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort 
               of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring.

                         I do. Because there's a lot of things 
                         around here that could use some 
                         attention. Believe me. But I've 
                         honestly been meeting that bus every 
                         day for four years now and it really 
                         does take just fifteen minutes, and 
                         if I take the time out of my lunch

               Sammy and Rudy drive home in silence. The orange sunlight 
               flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive 
               along.

<b>               EXT. PRESCOTT (SAMMY'S) HOUSE. DUSK
</b>
               The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years' 
               more wear on it.

               Sammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches 
               half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail.

<b>               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DUSK

               Sammy comes into the house carrying two bags of groceries. 
               Rudy follows, looking through the mail. Sammy passes through 
               the house and goes into the kitchen.

               Her whole face lights up and she grabs the letter. She tears 
               it open and reads it with growing excitement.

               Sammy opens her FILE DRAWER. Inside are tax files, household 
               files, miscellaneous files.

               She puts Terry's letter away in a very full file marked "Terry -- 
               Correspondence." The folder is stuffed with other letters, 
               on all different kinds of stationery from all over the 
               country, all from Terry.

               Sammy and Rudy are eating dinner. It's a biggish house for

                         live here. He's only gonna stay for 
                         a little while... And it's OK if you 
                         don't remember him, because you were 
                         only six the last time he was here...

               Rudy looks worried and doesn't answer.

               Rudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition

               Sammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine 
               and reading Rudy's story. It upsets her.

               Sammy sits on the edge of her bed, not dialing the phone. 
               She catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor-length 
               mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame. Against her better

               Sammy and BOB STEEGERSON are eating dinner at Dawson's, the

                         Because I never really say much to

                         know what to say. And I don't know 
                         whether I should just let him imagine 
                         whatever he wants to imagine, or 
                         whether I should sit him down sometime 
                         and tell him, you know, that his

               A tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not 
               much else. One window has a broken pane and an old sheet 
               neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out.

               TERRY PRESCOTT comes in. He is twenty-five years old: a real 
               mess with a certain natural appeal. He wears old jeans, very 
               old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat. He takes a 
               wool hat off his head. His hair is longish and dirty.

               SHEILA SADLER is sitting at the table by the fridge. She is 
               barely eighteen, frail and damaged.

               As she opens her purse, Terry takes a few vague steps toward 
               her. She takes out a tiny hippie-ish woven wallet and gives 
               Terry all the money in it: a twenty and two ones.

<b>               EXT. NEW YORK STATE -- MOUNTAINS -- HIGHWAY. DAY
</b>
               Wide open shot of hilly country and a big sky overhead. A 
               GREYHOUND BUS drives into the shot along the curve of the 
               highway.

<b>               INT. BUS (MOVING) -- BATHROOM. DAY
</b>
               Terry is seated on the toilet seat in the cramped bathroom 
               smoking a joint. He takes a huge hit and holds it in for as 
               long as humanly possible. He blows out what's left, takes 
               another equally huge hit and holds it in.

<b>               EXT. LOCAL HIGHWAY. DAY
</b>
               The BUS WHOOSHES along a smaller, heavily wooded roller-
               coaster road.

<b>               INT. BUS (MOVING). DAY
</b>
               Terry looks out the window at the passing scenery. The 
               sunlight flickers on his face.

               POV TERRY: The bus rolls past the hilltop cemetery.

               Terry shifts uncomfortably in his seat.

               POV TERRY: THE "WELCOME TO SCOTTSVILLE" SIGN whizzes by. 
               Houses start dotting the side of the road.

               Terry starts getting very agitated.

<b>               EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY
</b>
               Terry stands at one end of Main Street, backpack over his 
               shoulder, as the BUS DRIVES OFF. He looks around at the town 
               going about its Saturday afternoon business.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN. SIMULTANEOUS
</b>
               Loud country-western music is blaring as Sammy, wearing an 
               apron, sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and 
               hurries to the oven. There are also cookies, a pie, evidence 
               of massive fancy cooking. She puts on her oven mitts and 
               takes a lasagna out of the oven, as the phone rings. She 
               picks up.

<b>               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DAY

               Sammy practically bursts out the front door. She has changed 
               into nice clothes.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY. DAY
</b>
               Terry secrets himself in a small dark alley. He takes out 
               his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it. SMOKING, he 
               looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley.

<b>               EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER
</b>
               Terry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street. A skinny 
               man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake 
               hands. Terry says "Hi," but keeps on walking. He passes some 
               other people.

               He almost runs right into SHERIFF DARRYL, sixteen years fatter 
               and grayer.

<b>                                     SHERIFF

</b>                         Sorry.

               The Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile.

                         doin'? Gimme a cuddle!

               The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug. Terry is wasted and 
               selfconscious but smiling. He pats the Sheriff's back.

<b>               EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER
</b>
               The Sheriff walks along with Terry. Terry, very self-conscious 
               about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. The 
               Sheriff does not seem to notice.

               They stop outside Dawson's.

                         can.

               Darryl walks away. Terry stands outside the restaurant looking 
               for Sammy.

               Behind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table, 
               talking to the waitress.

               She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy 
               as she threads her way through the tables toward the door.

               Terry turns and sees her. He breaks into a big smile, tosses 
               his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. Through the window 
               we see them make their way toward each other.

               Sammy throws her arms around him. He hugs her back with a 
               big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES.

                         instigated it, at all. But they worked 
                         up all this bullshit against me and 
                         they threw me in the pen for three 
                         months. I didn't write you because I 
                         didn't want you to get all upset 
                         about it. I just figured you'd figure 
                         I was on the road for a little while. 
                         I know it was stupid and I'm sorry. 
                         I really didn't mean to make you 
                         worry. But you know what? I can't 
                         run around all the time doin' stuff 
                         or not doin' stuff because it's gonna 
                         make you worry! Because then I come 
                         back here, and I tell you about my 
                         fuckin'... traumas, and I get this 
                         wounded little "I've Let You Down" 
                         bullshit, over and over again, and 
                         it really just -- cramps me! Like I 
                         just want to get out from under it!...

               Terry sits at the bar, drinking beer. There are a few locals 
               in the place, but it's pretty dead. He looks around; his 
               energy is too restless for the near-empty bar.

</b>
               The DOOR OPENS, and TERRY COMES IN, smoking a cigarette. 
               He's plastered. He looks around the room. Looks at Rudy's 
               toys. Picks up some superhero comics and sits on Rudy's bed. 
               Then he spies Rudy's COMPOSITION BOOK, picks it up and starts 
               reading it.

                         something, everybody's havin' like a

                         kill somebody if his team didn't 
                         win. Or like if you told like a joke 
                         or a story, he always had to tell a 
                         better one? Kinda gets annoying after 
                         a while. Plus it was pretty scummy 
                         how he split on your mom and you... 
                         He was a prick. Probably still a 
                         prick. Fortunately for you though, 
                         your mom is like, the greatest. So 
                         you had some bad luck and you had 
                         some good luck.

               Sammy, in front of the mirror, finishes dolling herself up

               Sammy approaches RUDY and TERRY. They are bent over a big 
               nasty trench in the floorboard. There are wood shavings and 
               greasy pipe segments all over, and black smeary smudges on 
               the walls nearby.

                         leaking further down.

               Bob holds the door for Sammy and smiles at her. There is

               Terry swings the door open.

<b>               INT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT
</b>
               POV RUDY: A lot of men and women at the bar or in booths, 
               eating and drinking. Smoky, crowded and very loud. As he 
               follows Terry through the crowd various patrons notice him -- 
               some of the looks are friendly, some blank, some cold, i.e., 
               what's a kid doing in here?

               AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry and Rudy stand side by side facing 
               the players and waiting players gathered around the table. 
               Terry waves a few bills.

                         ten o'clock.

               A MOMENT LATER: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player 
               are side by side shooting for break. Terry is behind Rudy 
               coaching him.

                         and soft.

               They hit the balls. Rudy just clips his ball and it doesn't 
               go anywhere. 1st Pool Player's ball hits the opposite bank 
               and comes almost all the way back.

                         you could play.

               Rudy doesn't answer. Terry winks at him.

               A MOMENT LATER: 1ST POOL PLAYER BREAKS -- WHACK! -- The balls 
               scatter. Nothing drops. TERRY steps up to the table, chalking 
               up his cue.

               QUICK CUTS: Of Terry running the table and everyone watching. 
               Three-ball in the side. One-ball in the corner. Nine-ball 
               off three cushions and into the corner, and the eleven-ball 
               into the side. Rudy watches him.

               Terry has sunk everything but the eight ball. He leans over 
               to sink it. It's a fairly easy shot. He lines it up carefully, 
               and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the 
               corner pocket.

               A FEW MOMENTS LATER: Terry and Rudy sit side by side watching 
               as the 2nd Pool Player passes back and forth between them 
               and the camera, running the table. "Oohs" and "All rights" 
               emit from the spectators.

               Sudden silence. Then the clack of the balls connecting. A 
               great common GROAN goes up. RUDY looks up at Terry.

               Rudy looks at the TABLE: The eight-ball is two inches off 
               the corner. The cue ball is a few inches away from it. A 
               piece of cake, for an adult. Rudy looks deeply unconfident.

               He gets up and tries to line up the eight-ball. Terry is 
               right next to him.

</b>                         Just make sure to hit it really 
                         gentle. But firm. And hit it a little 
                         low so you get some backspin. Don't 
                         even hit it. Just kiss it.

               A long moment.

</b>                         I mean tap it. Firm but very, very 
                         softly. And don't shoot until you 
                         know it's going in. OK?

</b><b>                         OK.
</b>
               Everyone is relatively quiet. Rudy takes a few practice 
               strokes and then hits the cue ball, straight, but too softly. 
               It crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner, 
               slower and slower, hangs there, and DROPS.

               A GENERAL "HEYYY!" GOES UP and everyone claps and cheers. 
               Terry grabs Rudy. Rudy smiles, ecstatic.

               AT THE BAR: Darryl the SHERIFF, in his civvies, drinking a 
               pint of beer, notices Rudy and Terry.

               AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry picks Rudy up and turns him upside 
               down. Rudy laughs.

               They HEAR Bob's CAR DOORS SLAM. Terry makes a comic panicked 
               face and leaps up the stairs two at a time.

               OUTSIDE THE HOUSE: Sammy waves to Bob. Bob waves back as he 
               drives off. Sammy goes to the front door, opens it:

               Terry and Rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the 
               top of the stairs, shaking Rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically 
               trying to get the jacket off.

               Sammy comes in. They freeze.

               The congregation is coming out of the church and milling 
               around at the steps. SAMMY, with Rudy at her side, is saying 
               good-bye to some neighbors. She watches pregnant NANCY and 
               BRIAN go down the steps.

               POV SAMMY: Beyond Brian and Nancy, TERRY pulls up at the 
               curb in her car. He rummages around and produces FISHING 
               RODS which he waves, somewhat sheepishly.

               REVERSE: At top speed, Rudy runs away from Sammy and the 
               church, toward Terry and the car. Terry and Sammy exchange a 
               look from the distance.

                         a little responsibility for their 
                         actions, they might end up having a 
                         lot less trouble generally. That's 
                         all.

               Terry and Rudy drive along. Terry looks down at Rudy and 
               smiles. Rudy is tense and won't look at him.

               OVER TERRY AND RUDY'S SHOULDERS as Terry drives slowly past 
               dilapidated little houses in a very depressed residential 
               area. Terry is scanning the house numbers.

               He pulls up outside a small, plain, run-down ranch-style 
               house with a lot of junk out front, and gets out of the car. 
               Rudy stays in.

               Rudy gets out of the car and comes around. Terry waits for 
               him, and then they walk up to the front door. The buzzer 
               says "KOLINSKI."

               Rudy pushes the doorbell. They wait. There's some noise inside 
               and some voices. The sound of WALKING.

               THE DOOR OPENS. JANIE, a tired-looking young woman around 
               Terry's age, opens the door.

               RUDY SR. appears behind Janie. He's around thirty, wiry, 
               dressed in jeans and an old shirt. He doesn't look good. He 
               recognizes Terry.

               Rudy Sr. shoves Terry. Terry belts him, and suddenly they 
               are throwing wild punches at each other. Rudy goes sprawling 
               in the dirt.

               Terry knocks Rudy Sr. down and starts pummeling him brutally. 
               Janie comes out of the house and jumps on his back, trying 
               to pull him off.

               Terry throws Janie off him, grabs Rudy Sr. again and resumes 
               beating him up. Janie jumps back on top of him.

               Two neighbors run toward the melee to break it up.

                         her life, and you know why? Because 
                         she thinks she has to. Don't ask me 
                         why, but that's the truth. She thinks 
                         there's all these things she has to 
                         do, but you want to know one thing 
                         about your Mom? She's a bigger fuck-
                         up than I ever was. I mean, I know I 
                         messed up. You think I enjoy getting 
                         thrown in jail because I wanted you 
                         to face that prick your Dad like a 
                         little man and see what kind of a 
                         guy he is? I know I got a little 
                         carried away, and I lost my temper 
                         just a little bit -- which is not 
                         the end of the world either, by the 
                         way, just for future reference --And 
                         now she's kickin' me out of my own 
                         house because -- you know, because I 
                         fucked up a little bit. Which I 
                         totally admit. I was like -- totally 
                         ready to admit that.

               Terry walks through the little cemetery gate and makes his 
               way up the hill through the tombstones. He reaches his 
               parents' graves. He looks at the tombstones for a moment. He 
               puts his hand on top of one headstone, then the other.

               He sits down and smokes. He looks up at the SKY. It's a 
               beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds.

               He looks out over the hilly scenery. After a moment he shakes 
               his head a few times. He doesn't even know he's doing it. He

                         breakfast or anything? And I think

               Sammy is clearing the breakfast dishes. Rudy is finishing up 
               his cereal. The clock reads 7:50.

               Sammy comes out and looks up and down the road.

<b>               INT. LIVING ROOM. A FEW MOMENTS LATER
</b>
               Rudy sits in the living room in his baseball jacket. His 
               knapsack is on the floor beside him. He looks at the CLOCK: 
               8:06. Sammy comes into the living room and looks at him.

               They HEAR the PICKUP PULL UP OUTSIDE, O.C. Rudy gets up 
               immediately.

<b>               EXT. THE HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER
</b>
               Terry jumps out of RAY'S PICKUP. Sammy opens the front door 
               and Rudy runs out toward Terry.

<b>                                     RUDY

</b>                         Hey, how's it goin', man?

               Rudy stops short in front of Terry. Terry looks at Sammy, in 
               the doorway.

<b>               EXT./INT. CAR. DAY
</b>
               The car stops across the street from the BUS. The LAST KIDS 
               are getting in. SAMMY HONKS for the bus driver, and Sammy, 
               Terry and Rudy all get out.

</b>                         OK, well, that's gonna be pretty 
                         nice for you, because I write a pretty

</b>                         Bye.

               Rudy hugs Terry. Terry hugs him back. He is suddenly overcome 
               and presses his lips to the top of Rudy's head.

               Rudy walks to the BUS and gets on. The bus pulls away.

               Alone now, Sammy and Terry are not that comfortable. He moves 
               to get back in the car, and she does the same.

<b>               EXT. BENCH. DAY
</b>
               Sammy and Terry sit on a bench near the bus stop. Terry's 
               backpack is by his side.

                         Terry, I don't even know where you're

                         concrete plan yet. I have to go back

                         a lot. I still got some friends out 
                         there. I don't really know. Anyway,

</b>                         I do know where I'm going. I'm going 
                         to Worcester and I'm gonna try to 
                         see that girl. And then depending on 
                         what happens there, I thought I'd 
                         try to see if there's any work for 
                         me out West. And if there is, I'm 
                         gonna head out there for the summer 
                         and try to make some money. And if 
                         there isn't, I'll figure something 
                         else out. Maybe I'll stay around the 
                         East. I don't know... I really liked 
                         it in Alaska. It was really beautiful. 
                         You just -- It made me feel good. 
                         And before things got so messed up I 
                         was doin' pretty well out there. 
                         Seriously. But I couldn't stay here 
                         long, Sammy: I don't want to live 
                         here. But I'm gonna stay in touch. 
                         And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to 
                         see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll 
                         come home for Christmas. How about 
                         that? We'll have Christmas together.
                              (Pause)
                         Come on, Sammy. You can trust me...

               Still looking down, Sammy shakes her head, tears leaking

               The DOORS OPEN and Terry comes up the steps and into the

               Terry, in his seat, turns forward and watches the view go

               The morning sunlight flickers through the windshield into 
               the car as Sammy drives along toward work. She passes the 
               TOWN HALL CLOCK and sees that it's 9:20.

               She dries her damp cheek with a forearm and rolls down her 
               window to let the morning breeze blow through.

               Squaring her shoulders a little, she drives through town at 
               a slow and easy pace.
