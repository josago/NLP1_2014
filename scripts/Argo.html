          From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
          the protest. There are three primary buildings on
          campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE
          AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
          We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
          traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.

          Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.

          gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.

          Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something
          simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate
          and makes it to the other side.
          And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This
          isn't archive footage anymore.

          break across the lawn.

          A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all
          bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to
          the front of the protest --
          WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal.
          As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A
          WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from
          underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT

          More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet
          to the other side, one after another.
