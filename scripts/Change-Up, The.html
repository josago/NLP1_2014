<b>          OPEN ON: PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS
</b>          Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then a second baby
          joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear
          the worst two words a parent can ever hear:

<b>          GROGGY WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Your turn.

<b>          INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>
          DAVE LOCKWOOD, 30, bleary-eyed father of three, shuffles
          through his well-appointed suburban home, passing a
          grandfather clock reading 3:45. He stumbles over a TOY
          GIRAFFE -- it SQUEAKS, and Dave sleepily mumbles:

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Sorry Hank.

<b>          INT. NURSERY-- NIGHT
</b>
          His eyes half-open, Dave changes the diaper of his very cute,
          very insane nine month old daughter, SARAH, who screams and
          pitches about her changing table.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>
<b>                         PLEASE DON'T--
</b>          Honey, that's not--
          Maybe if you--
          She snatches a tin of baby powder and swings it about like a
          mace, knocking over the diaper caddy, the wipes, the lotion --
          and dispersing a cloud of white powder all over the nursery.
          Blinded and SNEEZING, Dave manages to stay on point and
          change the diaper like Van Damme at the end of Bloodsport.

<b>                         DAVE (CONT'D)
</b>          Can't-see ...must...persevere...
          He finishes changing Sarah, places her back in her crib, then
          picks up Sarah's twin brother, PETER, from his crib -- which
          is good because he's been SLAMMING his head against the wall.

<b>                         DAVE (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on, buddy, we've talked about
          the head thing--
          Dave places Peter on the changing table and opens his diaper.
          It's only wet, and Dave, pleasantly relieved, reaches for a
          fresh diaper...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>          Only Sarah has knocked the caddy all the way down the
          changing table...
          Holding down Peter with his left hand, Dave fully extends,
          leaning waaay over, reaching for the diaper caddy...
          It's just out of reach.. .he somehow stretches further...
          It's only when Dave glances back that he realizes that his
          head is now perfectly lined up with his son's QUIVERING ANUS.

<b>                         DAVE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh no.

<b>          THE BABY'S BUTT-HOLE ERUPTS
</b>          with mustardy projectile stool, blasting Dave in the eyes,
          nose and open mouth. Dave remains frozen, excrement dripping
          down his face -- but, like a true dad, he does not let go of
          his squirming child...

<b>          INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
</b>
          Dave staggers down the hall, his hair white with baby powder,
          his face covered in poo, and a twin in each arm SCREAMING
          into each of his ears.
          He soldiers on, stoic, an unsung hero in his time...

<b>          INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
</b>
          Juggling the twins in his arms, Dave wipes his face off with
          paper towels and prepares two baby bottles -- nipples,
          filters, defrosted breastmilk -- while the babies take turns
          kicking him in the balls and SCREAMING.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Please, sweetheart, not my--
          Honey, Daddy needs those--

<b>          INT. DEN -- NIGHT
</b>
          Dave sits on his couch and positions the screaming, squirming
          twins across his lap in an X pattern, plunks the bottles into
          their mouths -- and instantly the twins settle down and slurp
          away like perfect little angels.
          Dave exhales. Whew. Then he reaches for the remote control
          and turns on the TV. An old rerun of Magnum, P.I. is playing.
          Dave watches, exhausted and expressionless.

          short shorts, and Hawaiian shirt, teaches a nubile CO-ED in a
          scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun-drenched
          Waikiki. They're laughing and having a blast...
          Dave watches, detached... Then his face starts to change...

<b>          MAGNUM, P.I.
</b>          Is this the life you always dreamed
          of?
          Dave shakes his head, no, despair in his eyes...
          ON TV, the co-ed nods, yes, and hungrily kisses Magnum...
          Dave watches on with genuine existential longing... and soon a
          tear falls from his eye. And then another.

          Dave, in a conservative suit and clutching a massive coffee,
          hurries down the hall with FLEMMING STEEL III, 50's, stiff,
          humorless WASPY partner of this white shoe law firm.

          Dave quickly undoes his tie as Flemming turns down a hallway.
          SABRINA McARDLE, cute young paralegal, falls into step with
          Dave, stymieing laughter.

          She smiles and breezes back down the hallway. Dave stops and

          secretary, GLADYS, 71, sitting at her desk.

          Reddening, he snatches a huge pile of pink message slips and
          hurries towards his office. She follows him, scolding:

          switched bodies. We will refer to them by their "brain
          names," thus while this hungover dude definitely looks like
          Dave, inside he's Mitch, so that's what we'll call him. The
          actors, of course, will remain in their bodies.
          Mitch doesn't know any of this yet.

          He rolls over to see Jamie, sitting up in bed, pulling her
          breasts out of her tank top, getting ready to nurse the
          twins. Mitch launches out of bed, suddenly very awake.

          Mitch shields his eyes with his hands, shocked and disgusted.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          No. Get the merger docs from Gladys
          and take them to the conference
          room. All the partners will be
          there so do not speak to anyone.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Really? Because I can vamp--

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          NO! No vamping! And once the
          meeting starts, you will continue
          to say nothing. When a partner asks
          you for the merger documents, you
          will silently hand them over, okay?

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          No! Play it small. Really small.
          I've spent the last nine months
          banging out the terms of this deal,
          all you have to do is hand over the
          documents. That's it.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Dude, that's easy as fuck. Okay,
          for me, go home, put on some cool
          clothes, and get to set -- all the
          info is on my phone. Once you're
          there, go to Hair & Makeup and
          memorize your lines and try not to
          be a total douche to everyone,
          okay? This is the film industry.
          Everyone is really cool.
          They look at each other, very doubtful that this will work...

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Power hug.
          They hug tight then release.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Oh hey, you also need to pick up
          Cara from ballet at 4, okay?

          Jamie steams upstairs, pissed, with Cara in tow. Dave runs
          his hands through his hair, fuck! Mitch looks appalled:

          A beat. Then Dave starts LAUGHING. It builds. Dave hasn't
          laughed this hard in a long time. He pats Mitch's cheek.

          four crates of bird seed are all that occupy the living room.

          another woman who is not your wife,
          and last I checked, your wang is
          safely tucked away in my incredibly

          this chick is a lot to handle so
          pace yourself, okay? She's hornier

          Just then WHAM -- the door flies open and a very sexy blonde
          enters the apartment wearing a long trenchcoat and five inch
          stiletto heels. She moves towards Dave like a panther.

          anything underneath. Awesome.
          Less awesome is the fact that she's NINE MONTHS PREGNANT.
          Massive breasts sit atop a huge, distended, veiny, protruding
          stomach. Dave recoils.

          sucks in his dad-gut in the mirror.

          Mitch lies in bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling,
          horrified. Jamie slides in bed with him, touches his arm--

          joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear
          the worst two words a parent can ever hear:

<b>          INTERCUT WITH DAVE

          internet porn on Mitch's iPhone. Then the porn disappears,
          and "DAVE LOCKWOOD CALLING" appears on screen.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Hold on.
          Mitch puts the phone in his mouth and picks up the SCREAMING
          TWINS. Carrying them like bags of wheat, he jogs down

<b>                         THE HALLWAY
</b>          as they scream their heads off. He's totally rattled:

<b>                         MITCH
</b>
<b>          SHUT UP! STOP CRYING! JESUS CHRIST,
</b>
<b>          WE FUCKING HEAR YOU!
</b>
<b>          INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
</b>
          Mitch jogs into the kitchen and, plop, sets the twins on the
          COUNTER, then speaks into the phone again:

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          All right. In the kitchen.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Go to the fridge...
          Mitch turns away from the twins and opens the fridge. He sees
          a bottle of wine and immediately drinks from the bottle.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Yeah?

<b>                         DAVE

          the microwave for 3 minutes, then
          prepare two separate bottles...
          Mitch grabs a container of cow's milk, sniffs it, turns to
          give it to the babies -- to discover that Sarah is gone, and
          Peter is licking an ELECTRICAL SOCKET!

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Holy fuck!

</b>          First: attach the filter to the
          seal to the nipple...
          Mitch hears CLINK CLINK and spins to see that Sarah has
          crawled over to the KNIFE BLOCK and removed a BUTCHER KNIFE
          and a MEAT CLEAVER and is waving them about like rattles!

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Oh jesus oh jesus...
          Mitch approaches her, wide-eyed, tentative -- when Sarah
          giggles and spastically whips the cleaver at him! He barely
          sidesteps it, and it impacts into a cupboard door -- F-TWANG!

<b>                         MITCH (CONT'D)
</b>          This is so fucked up!

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          I know, right? And make sure you
          don't allow any air bubbles in.
          Mitch grabs a pair of tongs and, after a few attempts,
          snatches the butcher knife from Sarah's hands. Then he scoops
          her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother.
          Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Dude. Listen to me: you need to go
          downtown first thing tomorrow
          morning and you need to find that
          fucking fountain...
          He starts pouring cow's milk into the babies' mouths. It
          splashes all over them, but they manage to lap up some of it.

<b>                         MITCH (CONT'D)
</b>          Honestly, I'm really not sure how

          a rare exception. Always man-scape

          changed since you last dated...
          Mitch stops at the register to pay. Various CAR WASH
          EMPLOYEES keep saying hi to Dave, weirding him out.

<b>          CAR WASH EMPLOYEES
</b>          Hola, Mitch! / Como esta, Mitch?!

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          The bottom line is: the internet
          has revolutionized everything.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          You mean like J-date?

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Fuck J-date. No. The internet has
          changed chicks in three major ways:
          first, access and acceptance of
          pornography has commoditized women
          and pressured them into becoming
          sluttier at far younger ages, which
          is awesome.
          Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash.

<b>                         MITCH (CONT'D)
</b>          Second: text messaging has de-
          stigmatized the booty call. Call a
          girl at 3 in the morning for sex
          and it's creepy. Text her "SUCK
          WANG MIDNIGHT??" and it's classy. I
          have no idea why, but again, an
          awesome development.

          sweating... it's been a long time ...by the time he finally
          reaches the blonde, his voice is ridiculously shrill:

</b>          What? No. No, my Golden Rule of
          Dating is always find the fun.
          Think of it like this: for the next
          two hours, you're stuck with this
          chick. Doesn't matter if she's cool
          or crazy or if she was born with a
          vagina on her forehead -- you're
          stuck, so make the most of it. I
          dated this chick named Topaz once
          who may or may not have killed her
           father. Long story short, she
          looked like 50 miles of bad road
          and I wasn't interested, but I used
          our time together to learn about
          incest and the failures of the
          American Appellate Court system. I
          found it hugely informative, and
          Topaz got caught up in my
          enthusiasm and gave me a crying
          blowjob on the car-ride home, so
          everybody won. The point is: find
          the fun for yourself and great
          things will follow.

          and gazes around the restaurant. Dave's heart skips a beat,

          She exits. CEO Ted Norton looks at Flemming, intense.

</b>          It's a fair deal. I don't think
          we'll get much more out of them...
          The other execs all nod. Then Mitch BURRRRPS:

</b>          Fuck that, dude, you can do better.

          trying to fuck a Jewish girl and
          she keeps saying "no, no, I don't
          want to, I'm really drunk and
          you're not circumcised" but then
          she keeps making out with you and
          not getting out of your Fiero so
          you know she really does want it,
          she just needs to be nudged a bit
          more so she can rationalize it to
          herself and to her God, know what I
          mean? This is just like that.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          If this was really their final
          offer, they'd leave. Instead,
          they're sticking around, which
          means they have more money to
          spend.
          Ted looks at his execs. It's not a terrible point...

<b>          FLEMMING STEEL III
</b>          Do not listen to him, Ted, he is
          beyond reckless! If we make too

          driving them away.

</b>          Seriously, does anyone have a
          Pepto? Because I'm gonna throw.
          Finally, Ted opens the door and says to the mediator:

<b>          CEO TED NORTON
</b>          Tell Kinkabe we want an extra 100
          million and that is our final

          (loudly, to his execs)
          Fuel the jet. Let's go.
          The mediator heads off as the execs start packing up their
          briefcases, bluffing. Mitch points at Ted.

          what's on the other side, and it's
          great. . .and young... and supple...
          but it's not you. And the truth is
          there will always be another fence
          with shinier toys on the other
          side, but the only way to be happy
          is to say fuck the fence and just
          appreciate what you have, you know?
          Find the fun with what you got...

          you, pumpkin. I love you. And I
          love our weird little kids. And I
          can't believe I ever thought that
          wasn't enough.

          But he holds her firm. And soon she's kissing him back,
          confused and overwhelmed and crying...
          It's emotional and intense for him, too. They finally
          separate, but remain inches apart, breathing hard.

</b>          How's my favorite ballerina?!

</b>          Cara turns, takes Mitch's hand, and flips him onto his back.

<b>                         CARA
</b>          I'm not a ballerina anymore, bitch.
          She races off. Mitch painfully pulls himself to his feet.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Jesus fucking Christ...
          Dave sees SABRINA, looking angelic in a sundress, chatting
          with a circle of GUESTS on the patio.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          So. How's it going with Sabrina?

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Great. We just celebrated our two
          week anniversary.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Wow. Good for you.
          Mitch nods, proud, I know. Swigs his beer.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          You think she's fucking Fernando
          Valenzuela?
          We see that the man she's talking to is, in fact, Dodger
          great FERNANDO VALENZUELA, in a pimped-out white suit.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Maybe.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          I'm oddly okay with it.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          I can't believe they're family
          friends.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          I know. She really is perfect--
          Just then TATIANA and KIEFER SUTHERLAND approach, wheeling
          her newborn DAUGHTER in a pram.

<b>                         KIEFER SUTHERLAND
</b>          I gotta go feed her baby, but
          congrats on your new gig, bro.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          121.
</b>
<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Thanks, Kiefer. See you guys.
          Mitch kisses Tatiana on the cheek and they head off.

<b>                         MITCH (CONT'D)
</b>          It's creepy that Kiefer Sutherland
          is like way into other people's
          babies, right?

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Oh yeah.
          Dave flips the burgers.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Thanks again for hooking me up with
          the job at Amalgamated, man.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Hey, the CEO owed me a favor...

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          I think I'm really going to crush
          it in corporate America.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          I think so too.
          Just then, MITCH'S DAD approaches.

<b>          MITCH, SR.
</b>          I'm heading out. Thanks for having
          me.
          Mitch, Sr. pulls his son into an emotional hug.

<b>          MITCH, SR. (CONT'D)
</b>          I love you, Mitch.

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          I love you too, Dad.
          They break apart. Mitch, Sr. heads off. Then he stops. Turns.

<b>          MITCH, SR.
</b>          Hey Mitch...
          Mitch turns.

<b>          MITCH, SR. (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm real proud of you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          122.
</b>          Mitch nods, trying not to show how much this means to him.
          Mitch, Sr., heads off.
          Mitch and Dave stand side by side, reflective...

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          Is it weird that I miss your penis?

<b>                         MITCH
</b>          Not really.

<b>          SMASH TO BLACK.
