<b>          EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT -- MOVING
</b>
          A DISTORTED IMAGE of downtown city streets at night.
          This is not a FISHEYE LENS, but the REFLECTION in the
          mirrored surface of a helmet visor.

<b>          EXT. LUXURY BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
          A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE
          RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather,
          climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN.
          He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He
          conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the
          building's entrance.
          A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for
          a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT.
          THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what
          looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at

<b>          TUXEDO.
</b>          SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A
          digital readout: "SCANNING..." Then a long SERIAL
          NUMBER reads out and the name, "LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,"
          along with other personal information below.
          THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He
          reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious
          DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has
          a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety
          switches and buttons.
          The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can

<b>                         REACH HIM--
</b>          A sleek, futuristic LIMOUSINE pulls up and TUXEDO gets in
          the back. They're gone in an instant.
          The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He
          starts it and pursues the limousine.

          TUXEDO leans forward to the DRIVER, a muscular, handsome
          man in a suit named ARMANDO.

</b>
          THE LIMO moves through this seemingly deserted area,
          pulls up near a STEEL DOOR with a spray-painted X.
          TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open.

<b>                         TUXEDO
</b>          I can find my way back.
          ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the
          entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a
          SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he
          disappears inside.
          THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo
          has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch
          up with him.

          THE BOUNCER is a huge, bald man with JET BLACK skin, RED
          EYES and TEETH that glow fluorescently. The THROBBING

</b>
          POUNDING MUSIC. BODIES SLAM together in a brutal mosh
          pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful,
          others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at
          each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the
          edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An
          incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on
          the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them.
          A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The
          MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes,
          with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up.
          IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage,
          numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making
          out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here.
          TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached
          to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE
          on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own
          neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His
          features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he
          lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a
          sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC:

          A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes
          stands nearby. Tuxedo, recovering from the hit, gestures
          graciously for her to sit. She picks up one of the
          cords, gives him a sly smile. She opens her mouth,

          door, laughing. He pushes her against a brick wall, they
          grope each other hungrily, hands inside clothes, getting
          drenched in the warm downpour.
          WITH THE ASSASSIN, wearing his HELMET with the VISOR UP,
          as he approaches the entwined couple. TUXEDO hears him,

          ANGLE ON the alley's mouth as we hear the BLONDE'S
          SCREAM. Seconds later she staggers out, clutching her
          head, and collapses to the pavement. We hear an ENGINE
          START from the alleyway.
          THE ASSASSIN emerges on his bike, rides directly over her
          body unconcerned-- and ROARS into the night.

          considerably larger than the ones we see today.
          CAMERA PICKS UP SPEED, moves quickly to a run-down part

          A dark, decaying hallway. A MAN and a WOMAN move
          stealthily up the stairs, LASER-SIGHT GUNS in hand.
          The man is THOMAS GREER, the woman JENNIFER PETERS. Both
          are about 30, handsome, athletic. Greer's spent his life
          in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to
          make sense-- but as the world changes around him, he
          feels he's losing the thread. PETERS is junior to Greer,
          her attitude's professional but rigid, by the book.

          CHAINS. GREER and PETERS train their LASERS around the
          place, disturbed by the scene. A flash of MOVEMENT in a
          bedroom and a CRASH--

          GREER kneels beside the PSYCHO's body, pockets his

          He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one
          side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore
          and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY,
          oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck.
          We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated
          synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not
          artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly
          to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away.
          Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood
          humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly
          surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have
          an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and
          receiving impulses, they are completely inert.
          Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around
          at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND.

          the door as they move into the place.
          It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza
          boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around
          haphazardly. We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE,
          contact points embedded in the foam inside, shaped to
          accomodate a curvaceous female body.

          GREER and PETERS go down metal stairs into-a sprawling,
          high-tech surveillance center. COMPUTER WORKSTATIONS are
          arranged radially, at the hub is a central COMMAND
          STATION with large SCREENS facing in all directions.
          GREER and PETERS move toward the center. At first we see
          just the head and shoulders of scattered FIGURES, staring
          at the monitor screens.
          ON SCREENS - these are POV SHOTS from thousands of
          SURROGATES, the Feds can have a direct surveillance feed
          from any surrogate's eyes.
          We glimpse POV SHOTS of-- driving-- drinking in a bar--
          intimate conversations-- watching an old movie-- a sex
          partner's face.
          The FIGURES before the screens are WATCHER DRONES,
          specialized surrogates-- a head and shoulders mounted on
          a wheeled contraption attached to tracks. This enables
          them to move and stop at any monitor quickly, surveilling
          dozens of surrogates. Males and females, but all have
          the same faces.
          PETERS stares in wonder at this voyeur's paradise. GREER
          grabs her arm to keep her from getting hit as a WATCHER
          tracks past. The Watcher ignores them, intent on work.
          They mount stairs into the RAISED HUB that overlooks the
          work floor. An extremely corpulent human being-- BOBBY
          SANDERS-- sits on a reinforced rolling chair, which he
          keeps in almost constant motion, eying the DOZEN SCREENS
          up here at once.
          ON SCREENS - POVs of actual criminal activity-- frantic
          running across a park-- a burglary in a darkened jewelry
          store-- packets of drugs changing hands.
          BOBBY eats candy, guzzles soda, waves them off for a
          moment, speaking rapid-fire into his HEADSET.

          STRICKLAND is hit in the back, the force of the shot
          knocks him off his feet.
          GREER strides over to STRICKLAND, seemingly oblivious to
          the CROWD of Dreads collecting around him, pointing at
          him angrily.
          STRICKLAND twitches and moans, partly paralyzed. GREER
          stands over him, lets the rifle dangle. Strickland has

          from his grasp.
          A heavyset FEMALE DREAD wields the sawed-off shotgun.

          An army of AGENTS burst from an elevator in Kevlar and
          riot helmets, armed with AUTOMATIC RIFLES. They
          instantly bring the DREAD down in a barrage of gunfire.
          The agents move to the DREAD'S BODY-- he's very dead,
          pouring BLOOD from dozens of bullet wounds. One speaks

          Late afternoon. GREER emerges from a TAXI near the same
          gate we saw earlier. Greer wobbles, steadies himself
          against the car as he pays the CABBIE-- a DRONE
          SURROGATE, built into the seat.

          pauses, sickened as he sees--
          --the burned-out HELICOPTER HULK, now sprayed with

          DREADS look like ordinary working-class folks.
          A BARBECUE, a group of RESIDENTS laughing and drinking.
          Greer inhales the SMOKE as he passes, smiles to himself.
          A couple of FRIENDLY DOGS trot curiously after him for a
          moment, then return to the barbecue. GREER, not paying
          attention, brushes past an ELDERLY MALE PEDESTRIAN.

          are the first children we've seen, outside of a TV ad.
          A CLOUD OF DIESEL SMOKE from a decrepit BUS. Greer
          CHOKES on this, but doesn't seem displeased. His body

          comes to an open lawn with a fairly large CROWD gathered,
          illuminated by a FLAMING TORCH.
          THE PROPHET is speaking. He stands before a platform
          atop wooden scaffolding, firewood piled below. A
          formidable ring of BODYGUARDS stands between him and the
          gathered throng of DREADS.

          GREER has pushed his way gently toward the front to get a
          look at the BODY atop the funeral BIER.
          The corpse atop the bier is that of JACK STRICKLAND, eyes
          closed, hands folded.

          So saying, the PROPHET lifts the torch and touches it to
          the base of the PYRE, which ERUPTS IN FLAME.
          CLOSE ON STRICKLAND as the FLAMES lick up around him.
          LATER, the BIER consumed in FIRE, the MOURNERS
          dispersing. THE PROPHET is moving away, HANDLERS

          With that, he throws a SUCKER PUNCH to the gut. GREER
          doubles over. He seems amazed at the sensation, the
          pain. But he recovers, throws a wild punch at Miller an d
          misses by a foot. [Violence for Greer in human form
          should have a very different, painfully visceral feel,
          unlike when he was a surrogate.]

          cause the men to redouble their efforts. Finally, he's

          ANGLE DOWN - forty stories down to the street.
          GREER flinches back, reeling with vertigo. He moves
          along the edge, looking for something.
          ANGLE DOWN - the BALCONY outside Canter's study, just
          inside the roof overhang, a fifteen-foot drop.
          GREER squeezes his eyes shut, steeling himself for what
          he must do. He lowers himself to hang onto the edge,
          trying not to look down. He swings his body to get the
          momentum going the right way--
          --but his grip gives a moment too soon--
          GREER plunges from the roof to the BALCONY RAIL, hitting
          the railing hard, starting to fall off the wrong way.
          But he manages to grab onto the metal. He hauls himself
          up and collapses onto the balcony, lying on his back.
          HIS LEG has been injured in the fall, the pants torn,
          blood. GREER breathes audibly, in pain and exhaustion.

          The moment the Dreads have been waiting for. With a mass
          CRY, they're charging over the fallen BODIES of the
          GUARDSMEN and over the flattened fences.
          WIDE as THOUSANDS OF DREADS run out of the reservation
          into the streets of the city.

<b>          EXT. WASHINGTON STREETS - DAY
</b>
          GREER hobbles through the dreadful aftermath-- SMOKING
          AUTO PILEUPS, BODIES everywhere, most fallen in their
          tracks, a few remain on their feet. CAR HORNS, ALARMS in
          the distance. -
          A few disheveled DREADS are here, taking it in with
          delight and amazement. They WHOOP as they TIP OVER a
          couple of the standing surries.
          GREER passes a CAR on the sidewalk, its DRIVER slumped
          against the wheel-- the RADIO BLARES:

<b>                         RADIO VOICE

          FALLEN SURRIES all over the grounds. ARMED DREADS are
          rushing into the place, past the MOTIONLESS SENTRIES.
          They're making for the factory.

          The ROBOTIC ASSEMBLY LINE, still running until--

          SURROGATE PARTS are BLASTED in all directions.

</b>
          FIRE SPREADS across the rows of SURROGATE TEMPLATES,
          packed together tightly.
          CLOSE on a MELTING FACE, the deforming PLASTIC SKULL and
          ELECTRONICS within.

          GREER enters, moves immediately for his wife's bedroom.

          He KNOCKS gently, then tries the door-- it isn't locked.

<b>          INT. GREER'S APARTMENT/MAGGIE'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
          The room is DIM, there's a FORM huddled in the bed,
          SOBBING, covers pulled up. GREER moves slowly toward
          her, speaks in a soothing voice.

<b>                         GREER
</b>          Maggie, it's me.
          She pulls away from his touch at first, struggles.

<b>                         MAGGIE
</b>          No! Please no, don't look at me...
          Greer pulls away the covers to reveal the REAL MAGGIE.
          She's pale, emaciated and malnourished, tears running
          down her face. She shrinks away from him.

<b>                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
</b>          No Tom, I don't want you to...
          It doesn't matter to Greer-- he takes her in his arms and
          holds her close.

<b>                         GREER
</b>          It's OK, it's OK...

          and GREER'S NEIGHBORS EMERGING, blinking in the
          unfamiliar sunlight. Most wear robes, sweatclothes.
          They're all ages, some overweight, others homely-- it's
          almost a relief after all the young, perfect people.
          DOWN THE STREET, OTHERS EMERGE, regard each other warily,
          like people after an earthquake. Some begin speaking to
          each other for the first time, in whispers at first,
          others take in the SUNSET which bathes the neighborhood
          in orange light.
