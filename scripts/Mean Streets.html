          was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one
          year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised
          sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected
          many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and
          has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His
          favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and
          Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more.
          He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges
          quotes from it with his friend TONY.

          CHARLIE and the others. He runs an illegitimate bar and

          from high school for vandalism and consequently spent
          several months in reform school. He is reckless,
          unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4-
          F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next
          door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own

          faster now and smiling a little more.

          CHARLIE's zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs. There
          is no particular logical sequence except that events are
          suited to the rythmic pattern of the music.
                         
          1. CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the
           music.
                         
          2. CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick. He attempts to hit a
           filled shot glass towards TONY at the other end of the
           bar. He fails.
                         
          3. CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's
           table without moving the glasses or bottles. This also
           fails.

          4. A punch is thrown at someone. A lit cigarette in the
           puncher's fist creates a swift arc of light in the
           darkness.
                         
          5. The Strippers finally appear on stage. CHARLIE becomes
           obsessed with the Negro stripper DIANE. He shouts to
           her, tosses things, and calls her names. She tries, half
           amusedly to ignore him but she can't.
                         
          6. TONY drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort, and as a
           chaser swigs down Aqua Velva.

          The people in the bar do not respond. CHARLIE shrugs. The
          BOY casually leaves the bar and walks to the men's room.

          The BOY slowly swings the door open and stares at the DRUNK
          leaning over the urinal, half asleep. He takes out his
          pistol and calmly shoots the DRUNK three times in the back.
          To the BOY's surprise the DRUNK does not immediately fall
          dead. Instead, he turns and grabs the BOY by the throat.
          They struggle in the open doorway.

          The Italian music is still playing. Everyone in the bar has
          frozen in position as they watch the scene.
                         
          In his astonishment CHARLIE allows the cards to fall from
          his hands.
                         
          The YOUNG BOY breaks away from the DRUNK and runs towards
          the exit.
                         
          The DRUNK, running only on sheet determination, stumbles
          along after the boy.
                         
          The people in the bar, including CHARLIE, dash behind tables
          and jump behind the bar for cover.

          The BOY reaches the exit and fires at the DRUNK from the top
          of the stairs. The DRUNK still follows.

          The BOY runs down the street and disappears into the darkness.
          The DRUNK staggers out into hte cobblestone street. His
          mind is gone, it is now just a physical matter of the body
          being stopped by the presence of a stationary object.

          ushers them into the car.

          CHARLIE returns to the bedroom. JOHNNY BOY appears to be
          asleep. CHARLIE goes to the window and peers through the
          blinds. He sees in the window across the fire escape.
                         
          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES. TERESA is going through the various
          stages of getting dressed.
                         
          TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and
          intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she
          makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically
          supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented
          her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious
          relationships with men. She has however, been having an
          affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept
          secret from both families because the families regard each
          other as blood relations.
                         
          CHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has
          begun to dial the telephone.

           want to report a disturbance. Yeah
           this man and woman next door are
           disturbing the peace. They're
           keeping me awake all night now.
           What the hell is this. What?
           Well... yelling, fighting, throwing
           things. Uh-huh. If they don't
           kill each other soon I'm goin' over
           there and do the job myself. Yes -
           the address is 270 Mott street. I
           think it's apartment 2-r. Yeah,
           right... thanks. Look, I demand
           immediate action. Never mind my
           name I don't like getting involved
           in things like this.

          He hangs up roughly and returns to his position in bed.
          CHARLIE shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this
          was a common occurance. CHARLIE turns back to look at
          TERESA but she is no longer in her room.

          CHARLIE is dreaming this sequence. He and TERESA are both
          nude. She is lying face down on the bed. He approached and
          ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate
          sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on
          the bed, her legs, back, and his hands. Charlie cries out
          in pain.

          image in the mirror for a moment, then makes a face. He
          checks the whiteness of his teeth, pulls back his hair, and
          checks his complexion. The mirror image begins to speak.
          The CAMERA PANS BACK to CHARLIE'S FACE. His mouth is not
          moving.

          CHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant.
          This restaurant was considered an above average business
          with quality and prices to match when it was first opened
          three years ago. The quality has diminished but the prices
          remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE
          is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up
          a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it.
          He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She
          apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on
          the table. He takes a menu.
                         
          A chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He
          is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his
          shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are
          smeared with grease and dirt. He is tired and disgusted.

          CHARLIE enters a small Italian cafe and nods greetings to
          some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the
          room. This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy
          store, luncheonette, and meeting place for CHARLIE'S uncle
          GIOVANNI and his associates.
                         
          GIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty. He is well respected and
          powerful both in and out of the neighborhood. He became a
          head figure not by being introduced formally as was the
          custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the
          organization. GIOVANNI is well dressed but not a stereotype
          of an old Mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man.
                         
          GIOVANNI converses intermittently in Italian.

          room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at
          the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle.
                         
          MARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest
          associate, brought into the organization in the traditional
          manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders).
          He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to
          GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE.
                         
          MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are
          deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by
          unnoticed and walks into the bathroom.
                         
          CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He
          shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the

          CHARLIE walks directly to the front door of the cottage and
          rings the bell confidently. The door is opened immediately
          which startles him. From inside the house we see GROPPI'S
          back as he holds the door open. He is in a satin robe. We
          can see CHARLIE'S startled face through the partially opened
          door.

          At that moment a nude girl, her back to the CAMERA appears
          in the FOREGROUND. This startles CHARLIE even more.

          but there is no answer. He realizes he's been had.

          tuxedo-type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his

          the scene. CHARLIE sits at the kitchen table, TONY opposite
          him, and the others gather around. The party is getting
          noisier. TONY gives CHARLIE a glass of ice cubes. CHARLIE
          plays the part of a priest, during the Mass when the chalice

          CHARLIE lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest
          would. He signifies that there is enough in the glass.

          them begins to break up as CHARLIE and TONY begin to have
          fun with each other. TONY pulls down his mask, revealing a

          CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take
          them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a
          sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his
          attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top
          floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is
          having a party. The sound echoes through the streets.
          Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open
          windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of
          the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the
          fire escape.
                         
          CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard
          and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find
          JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb.

          into JOHNNY BOY'S face. JOHNNY BOY picks it up and slowly
          smooths it out. He sets it on fire as he talks.

          A young girl is in her room with her maid. The maid is
          helping her dress. Eerie music creates a frightening
          atmosphere. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY watch nervously affected
          by the film's mood. The theatre is a 42nd street one with
          lots of sleeping drunks.
                         
          Suddenly, the maid's face begins to contort as if she's
          seeing something horrible. The audience is on edge. The
          young girl sees the maid and shouts "What is it?" - but the
          maid only sneezes.

          There is practically no one on the street. The early
          morning light makes everything a clammy grey. CHARLIE waits
          at the bottom of the steps.

           He got you outta jail. Now...
           (reaching in pocket)
           he wants you outta the way.
                         
          MARIO hands CHARLIE an envelope containing an airline ticket.

          CHARLIE stares at the ticket in his hand. MARIO is obviously
          uncomfortable.

          The TWA terminal at Kennedy. TONY'S car pulls up to the
          curb, CHARLIE gets out, waves away help from an idle porter,
          and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat. TONY leans
          across the seat toward him.

          CHARLIE nods and watches the car pull away. Then he picks
          up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal.

          The place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement.
          CHARLIE is noticeable because he is the only member of the
          crowd who walks slowly, without any apparent mission or
          destination. He makes his way toward the large flight board
          that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce
          planes to and from every part of the world. On the flight
          board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin
          and change every moment. He passes the insurance machines
          and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman
          calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE
          continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses
          and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy
          dogs and flight bags. He looks at the cross.

          The ticket desk is under the flight board. CHARLIE eventually
          works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor
          and stands staring at the board. He sees the names of
          dozens of cities flashing before him. As he watches, a
          pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk.

          CHARLIE stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision.
          He apparently does not hear her.

          CHARLIE hears her this time. He reaches into his jacket
          pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to
          her. The clerk starts to open it to check the destination.

          back at her with a quality that is almost defiance.
