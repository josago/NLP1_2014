<b>               A BOAT
</b>
               Specifically, a garbage scow.

               We see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty 
               Mississippi.

               Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, 
               except for an incongruously heroic score.

               The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with 
               the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film 
               rather than a feature.

               One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is 
               obviously library. And not a new library either.

               The garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, 
               sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming 
               river island. Disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise 
               from where they were picking through trash. Their squawks, 
               like the boat horn, are not quite believable as SYNC.

               The head credits end as the anthemic music resolves.

<b>               EXT. SAUCIER, MISSISSIPPI - DAY
</b>
<b>               AN OLD HOUND DOG
</b>
               lies on the weather-grayed and -roughened planking of a front 
               porch. The porch is half-shaded from the noonday sun. It is 
               quiet except for the chirr of heat bugs, close by, and, very 
               distant, many voices in chorus, engaged in divine worship in 
               a Baptist church sufficiently far away that vagaries of breeze 
               fan them in and out of audibility.

               We once again hear the toot of the scow's horn, distant now 
               and played as real, not slapdash effect. At this, the dog 
               lifts his nose to catch the breeze, sniffs, and then, whining, 
               lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his 
               forepaws. He huffs briefly and goes to sleep.

               We DRIFT UP to show that the dog is sleeping before the

</b>
               Your source for worms, lures, etcetera, etcetera...

               We TRAVEL OVER TO REVEAL that the modest one-story structure 
               houses two establishments; its other front door leads to the

<b>               SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING.
</b>
               A campaign sign in the window on the municipal side shows a 
               black man of late middle-age beaming and giving the viewer a 
               thumbs-up:

               RE-ELECT WAYNE WYNER SHERIFF/He Is Too Old to Go to Work.

<b>               INT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY
</b>
               We hear snoring on top of a low, steady hissing sound.

               We are DRIFTING toward the door of the lock-up, which stands 
               open. The small cell is empty, its bed neatly made.

<b>               A KEY
</b>
               We are ARCING slowly around a jailer's key on a ring that 
               hangs from a nail. The OFFSCREEN snoring and whirring 
               continues.

               The TRACK'S SHIFTING ANGLE now makes the light catch a spider 
               web spun between the key and the wall.

<b>               POLICE SCANNER
</b>
               We DRIFT across the face of the radio. The peaceful steady 
               hissing jumps in louder at the CUT: it is uninterrupted: a 
               transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss.

               The snoring is also louder here. As we TRAVEL OFF the radio 
               we are COMING ONTO a pair of feet propped up on the desktop.

               They belong to SHERIFF WYNER, tipped back in his chair, 
               fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward.

               As the MOVING CAMERA FINALLY ENDS on him, there is the ring 
               of a telephone -- muffled, not present.

               It nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a 
               snore as he awakes, and then rocks forward to pick up his 
               phone.

<b>                                     SHERIFF WYNER
</b>                         Sheriff Wyner...

               The muffled ringing continues; the sheriff looks, puzzled, 
               at the phone. Now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled 
               voice next door:

<b>                                     VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                         Worms.

               The sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts 
               his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the 
               front door open.

               The sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, 
               fear.

               He manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile:

               Mrs. Munson closes the door behind her. She wags a paper fan 
               and mutters:

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON
</b>                         He's a good man. Just needs 
                         instruction. Dog, you in peoples' 
                         way.

               The dog stirs with a whine and ambles off.

<b>               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               With a neatly tended garden. It is the last house on a street 
               of other similarly modest but well maintained homes; beyond 
               it the street disappears down a bluff. The empty space beyond 
               suggests a wide river, and indeed we can see the top of an 
               anchored, gaudily painted paddle-boat poking over the rise. 
               The paddle-boat is apparently anchored at the near bank of 
               the river.

               Mrs. Munson is entering by the gate. She stops in the garden 
               and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect 
               row of flowers.

<b>               I/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - DAY
</b>
               Mrs. Munson lets herself in. A cat lopes up to her, the bell 
               around its neck tinkling, and leans mewing into her leg.

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

               Mrs. Munson hand-cranks a can opener around a tin of cat 
               food.

</b>                         Mm... gizzards...

               The cat paces back and forth between her legs, leaning into 
               them and purring, responding to the snap of tin as the cover 
               comes off the can.

               The can contains cubed processed gizzard in a gelatinous 
               medium like the stuff that clings to gefilte fish.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Above the fireplace is an oil portrait of a serious-looking 
               black man of late middle-age with a neatly groomed mustache 
               starting to gray. A couple of candles sit on the mantel below 
               the portrait, giving it the semblance of a shrine.

               Mrs. Munson enters and lights the candles.

               She shakes out the match and sits in a rocker and takes up

               There is the distant moan of a riverboat horn.

               A gust of wind hums under the eaves; the candles below the 
               portrait flicker. As Mrs. Munson looks around the room, 
               vaguely towards the ceiling, sensing a negative aura, the 
               cat arches its back and hisses.

               At this moment the doorbell rings.

               The cat shrieks and bolts out the door, past the man on the 
               stoop: GOLDTHWAIT HIGGINSON DORR, III.

               He is a middle-aged Southern gentleman wearing a panama hat 
               and a cape over a cream-colored suit. He has dark circles 
               under his eyes. The smile he attempts, mournful yet courtly,

               Dorr casts his hat aside and starts awkwardly climbing the 
               tree. He gasps as he climbs:

               The cat backs away down a branch, arching its back and 
               hissing.

               Dorr, on his stomach, inches after the cat, grunting:

               The branch breaks, hinging down to slam Dorr face-first into 
               the trunk, from where he drops the rest of the way to the 
               ground.

               Othar's portrait, upside-down, seems to be looking bemusedly 
               down on us.

               An OBJECTIVE ANGLE shows Dorr lying on the couch, a damp 
               washcloth on his forehead, eyes rolled back to look at the 
               picture.

               Mrs. Munson is entering with a cup of tea. Dorr swings his 
               feet out to sit up and accept the tea.

               Pancake's manner is professorial:

</b>                         World War I vintage gas mask. It's 
                         authentic. Strapped on, of course, 
                         so it can't fall off. The animal is 
                         free to be as active as he wants, 
                         doesn't inhibit his movement, and I 
                         think it really sells the whole 
                         doughboy thing--

</b>                         It looks like a fucking joke.

               Pancake stares at the director for a moment and, though not 
               doing anything, makes a sound of concentrated effort:

               The director squints at him:

</b>                         What?

               Pancake comes out of his trance, or whatever it was:

                         gets to the Kennel Rations?

               The dog looks up from person to person as each speaks, 
               twisting its neck to peer through the eyeholes. Its breathing 
               is growing louder.

               The dog gets down on its knees, slowly, like a camel,

               The dog flops over into the mud.

               His hand gouting blood, he finally manages to get the gas 
               mask off.

               A crowd is starting to gather and gape. The director barks

<b>               EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
</b>
<b>               POV
</b>
               We are looking out from inside a football helmet; we hear 
               the super-present breathing of the helmet's occupant. Just 
               over the breathing we can hear the muffled shouting of a 
               snap count.

               We are in a crouch position looking downfield. At the call 
               of "Hike!" we and everyone on the field spring into action.

               We sprint downfield, the breathing becoming even louder. A 
               very big person downfield is sprinting toward us.

               After several yards, still on the move, we PAN quickly around 
               to look back for the quarterback. Barely visible among 
               converging bodies, he is releasing the football toward someone 
               else.

               Easing up on the run we PAN BACK around to look downfield 
               just as the oncoming defender is upon us and -- CRUNCH -- 
               slams into us. A STROBING PAN leaves us looking up at the 
               sky. Our loud breathing has stopped.

               After a long beat the breathing resumes with a raggedy labored 
               inhale. It continues irregularly. Another helmeted player 
               appears above us to peer down into our helmet. He extends a 
               hand to help us up.

<b>               HUDDLE
</b>
               We are looking back and forth around the circle at our 
               gathered teammates.

               All, with a simultaneous hand clap:

<b>                                     TEAM

<b>               LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
</b>
               Lined up opposite us is a snarling defender.

               Once again, over loud breathing, we can just hear the shouted 
               count.

               At "Hike!" we straighten to meet the defensive lineman lunging 
               at us. His mouthpiece clatters against ours and in horrific 
               CLOSE-UP he strains against us, his animal gurgles of effort 
               audible over our own ragged breath.

               With a primal roar from the defenseman our POV tips back and 
               up, BOOMING DOWN to stop with a CRUNCH against the ground, 
               staring up. Once again our breathing has stopped.

               After a beat a foot is planted on our helmet as a looming 
               running back steps on us in his charge downfield. He is 
               pursued by defenders some of whom leap over us and some of 
               whom by the sound of it step on various body parts.

                         man!... Hey! BUTTHEAD!

               This brings our wandering attention PANNING back to the 
               quarterback:

               On "Hike!" we sprint downfield.

               The same distant defender sprinting toward us.

               We hear low but very present a dismayed:

<b>                                     HUDSON (O.S.)

               Our breathing is torn by rasping wheezes of effort as we 
               continue to run.

               We look back.

               Every player is looking directly at us.

               A huge spiralling football coming at us -- too close, too 
               soon -- and--

<b>               BONK!
</b>
               It bounces off our mouth guard and flies up.

<b>                                     HUDSON (O.S.)

               We are looking forward just as

<b>               CRUNCH!
</b>
               We are hit by the defender.

               We once again land face-up.

               Very steeply FORESHORTENED, right over us, we see the defender 
               juggling the live ball.

               With a moan, our own hand reaches weakly up towards the ball 
               and the high, distant defender.

               He finally gathers in the ball and securely tucks it, and 
               starts back upfield.

               We climb wearily to our feet. We look back upfield just in 
               time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in 
               the end zone. He pauses for a moment to point a gloved hand 
               directly at us, then resumes his strut.

               Shouting from the sidelines brings our PANNING attention 
               over.

               The coach, face twisted with fury, is shouting at us and 
               using his clipboard to wave us off the field.

               We trot toward the sidelines.

               All of our teammates stare at us –- some in shock, some in 
               anger, some in pity.

               At the sideline bench our POV swings round as we seat ourself. 
               A hand reaches up to the mouth guard to pull off the helmet 
               and we

               It is a typical sunbaked concrete strip mall with a Seven-
               Eleven, a launderette, and a Hi-Ho Donut. The Hi-Ho Donut 
               sign shows a pink donut with sprinkles and says in much 
               smaller lettering: And Croissants.

               A beat-up Impala pulls into the lot, pulsing hip-hop music. 
               After a long rumbling idle the ignition is killed. Both front 
               doors open. Two BLACK KIDS get out and look around with a 
               manner that is if anything too casual.

               There is faint muzak and loud air-conditioner hum. Glass 
               cases display donuts identified as GLAZED, JELLY, and FANCIES. 
               Fancies ooze yellow goo. The jelly on the jelly donuts is 
               developing a crust of age. The glazed also look moth-eaten.

               little formica tables staring into a coffee cup. Next to the 
               coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes.

               Behind the counter is a middle-aged VIETNAMESE WOMAN in a 
               neat white blouse.

               The two youths enter pulling out enormous handguns from 
               underneath their windbreakers.

               The woman stares blankly.

               A man appears from the kitchen in back. He is a middle-aged 
               Vietnamese gentleman in a crisply pressed khaki leisure suit. 
               An ascot is knotted at his neck. He wears aviator eyeglasses. 
               In his mouth smolders a half-burned-down filterless cigarette. 
               This, we shall learn later, is THE GENERAL.

               The two youths look at her briefly. Nothing else is 
               forthcoming.

               The drunk looks up from his paper bag.

                         see?

               The General stares at him. As with his wife, none of it seems 
               to register; unlike his wife, he seems unperturbed.

               He is pointing the gun directly at the General's head.

                         shoot. Okay? Three sec–- huh!

               The General has swung his fist up to hook two fingers inside 
               the youth's nostrils. His gun clatters to the floor. The 
               fingers are way, way up his nose. Only one knuckle shows on 
               each finger.

               The youth is staring cross-eyed at his own nose.

               His friend is also stupefied.

               The General still impassively sucks on his cigarette. The 
               first youth is on the verge of tears:

<b>                                     YOUTH #1

</b><b>                         MOTHERFUCK!
</b>
               He raises his gun to start firing.

               As he does so the General uses his hook-hold on the other 
               youth's nose to slam his head backwards, down into some 
               Fancies.

               The door opens and a customer walks in, a semi-elderly lady 
               with a cane.

               Youth #2, eyes rolling, wildly swings to cover the door, 
               then back to the General who has his friend's head pressed 
               into the Fancies, then uncertainly over to the Vietnamese 
               woman who is loudly yelling at him in Vietnamese.

               Cigarette still dangling from his lower lip, the General 
               calmly plucks a pot of coffee from the coffee warmer and 
               tosses it into Youth #2's face.

               Youth #2 screams.

               The car is still pulsing hip-hop music. Youth #2 stumbles 
               out of the Hi-Ho, hands covering his face and sinks to his 
               knees.

<b>               INT. HI-HO DONUT - DAY
</b>
               The General now has the first youth's face pressed into the 
               Fancies from behind. Without disturbing his smoking, the 
               General repeatedly kicks the youth in the ass.

               His wife, muttering irritably in Vietnamese, is wheeling a 
               water bucket and mop to where the floor is covered with 
               coffee.

<b>               INT. CHURCH - DAY

               At the CUT many voices are swelling in a song of worship. It 
               is a black Baptist church, and the music has great energy.

               The white-robed choir finishes singing; a preacher takes the 
               podium.

               women, mostly of middle age and elderly, mostly wearing 
               elaborate go-to-church hats.

               He looks back at the long black vintage Lincoln hearse parked 
               at the curb behind him.

</b>                         ...No no, no bereavement, though it 
                         is so kind of you to enquire. No, 
                         the hearse is simply a vehicle 
                         commodious enough to accommodate all 
                         of the members of our ensemble. And 
                         of course our instruments, contrived 
                         in an age ignorant of 
                         miniaturization...

               He turns and gestures at the vehicle.

               At his sign, Gawain, the custodian, emerges from the driver's 
               side.

               Clark Pancake emerges from the front passenger side.

               The General, wearing a different but equally pressed khaki 
               suit and ascot, and with a smoking cigarette in his lips, 
               emerges from a back door.

               Gawain goes to the back of the hearse and opens its hatch to 
               let out Lump Hudson, the football player.

               Lump helps unload five large and oddly shaped instrument 
               cases, each man taking one except for Lump himself, who 
               carries two. As the parade of losers and misfits winds its 
               way up the walk:

               Gawain nods as he passes by.

               The General tosses his cigarette away and bows stiffly as he 
               passes.

               As he hands Dorr the violin case:

               Mrs. Munson sizes up the group.

                         the expression is uniquely 
                         appropriate...

               He gives a sickly smile.

</b>                         ...as quiet as the crypt.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY
</b>
               The General stands stock still, his nose an inch away from 
               the earthen wall, studying it, squinting through the smoke 
               of the cigarette pinched between his lips.

               The rest of the men are opening their cases and taking out 
               the instruments. Gawain's case contains, however, not a 
               musical instrument but a boombox and several tapes. He loads 
               one of the tapes into the machine.

<b>                                     DORR
</b>                         What do you think, General? Present 
                         any problems?

               After a beat the General turns away from the wall to give 
               Dorr a look into which one might read anything, or nothing.

               Gawain hits play on the boombox and the cellar is filled 
               with the fussy strains of baroque chamber music.

               Dorr nods.

<b>                                     DORR
</b>                         ...Good then.

               He spreads a map open on the sackbutt case.

<b>                                     DORR
</b>                         ...All right, gentlemen, why don't 
                         we all crowd around and go over the 
                         plan.

               The biggest feature on the map is a wavy, roughly north-south 
               pair of lines: a river. A boat icon sits at one edge and 
               from it a dotted rectangle extends inland.

               Dorr taps at the boat icon with his fiddle bow.

<b>                                     DORR
</b>                         ...This, gentlemen, is the Lady Luck, 
                         gambling den, cash cow, Sodom of the 
                         Mississippi delta -- and the focus 
                         of our little exercise. Here is 
                         Orchard Street...

               He is tracing a street that parallels the dotted rectangle 
               extending from the boat. The street is lined by small house 
               icons on either side; the bow comes to rest on one of those 
               icons.

<b>                                     DORR
</b>                         ...and here is the residence of Marva 
                         Munson, the charming lady whom y'all 
                         met moments ago. Gentlemen...

               Bow taps emphasize:

</b>                         ...You... are... here. Now. This 
                         brings us to this square...

               The bow indicates it, and then withdraws.

               Dorr uses the bow as a swagger stick to punctuate as he begins 
               to pace.

<b>                                     DORR

                         legislature, have decreed that no 
                         gaming establishment shall be erected 
                         within its borders upon dry land.

                         activity itself is restricted to 
                         riverboats, no such restriction 
                         applies to the functions ancillary

               Dorr's smug smile fades. Testily:

                         square represent?

               Gawain hesitates, the question's obviousness suggesting to 
               him some trick.

               Dorr's eyes close. A smile of feline contentment curls his 
               lips. He murmurs:

                         to the counting room is fiercely 
                         guarded, and the door itself is of 
                         redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when 
                         the casino is closed the entire

                         far from the guard, reposes the money,

               He crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, 
               pleased with himself, he smiles.

                         talents, men with, in fact only two

                         fit to answer my little advertisement 
                         in the Memphis Scimitar, and, two, 
                         you are all going to be, in 
                         consequence, very very incredibly 
                         rich. Let us revel in our adventure, 
                         gentlemen. Let us make beautiful 
                         music together. And above all, 
                         gentlemen, let us keep it to 
                         ourselves. What we say in this root

               The men at work, tunneling.

               The cat sits on the cellar floor, head cocked, gazing at the 
               hole now opened in the wall.

               Lump, in a sleeveless undershirt, glistening with sweat, 
               wields a pickaxe at the forward point.

               At the mouth of the hole Clark Pancake shovels dirt into a 
               heavy plastic refuse bag held open by Gawain.

               G.H. Dorr sits on a camp chair, one hand idly waving time to 
               the music, reading an old and yellowed tome with half-glasses 
               perched midway down his nose.

               The General hops nimbly out of the tunnel and unzips and 
               steps out of his all-in-one to reveal, underneath, his neatly 
               pressed leisure suit and ascot.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Later, Dorr stands at the head of the cellar stairs, looking 
               around the empty parlor. He gives a nod down the stairs and 
               the men troop up past him, carrying sacks of earth.

               Over the mantelpiece, the eternal flame of the devotional 
               candle almost animating his features, Othar seems to watch 
               the men as they cross to the front door.

<b>               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               The men load the earth into the hearse.

<b>               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT
</b>
               We are at the Mississippi bridge that we saw in the prologue 
               to the movie, but now, in dead of night, deserted.

               The hearse is pulling up at the middle of the bridge and 
               dimming its lights. The men emerge; when they open the back 
               of the hearse to pull out the sacks, the cat bounds out to 
               watch from a distance.

               We watch the men from HIGH, ANGLED DOWN along the masonry of 
               a tower that stands in the middle of the suspension bridge. 
               An ornamental gargoyle leers in the foreground.

               The garbage scow is approaching. We hear the low toot of its 
               horn as it nears the bridge.

               Lump is poised with the first sack hugged to his chest, 
               leaning over the railing.

               The nose of the barge enters below us.

               Lump releases the sack.

               We watch it drop dead away like a bomb from an airplane.

               It thuds distantly onto the barge. The next sack has been 
               passed up to Lump and is released.

               The cat watches. Its orange eyes blink. Its pupils adjust.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT
</b>
               A PULL BACK shows that the cat is in fact back in the 
               basement.

               Its POV: continued tunneling.

               Back to the cat, watching, then turning its head at a noise:

               At the head of the stairs, the cellar door is opening.

               A whistle from the General and Lump and Clark Pancake scramble 
               from the tunnel. They whip a curtain over its opening and 
               all men grab up their instruments as Dorr, covering with a 
               cough, turns off the CD player.

               The General, his ever-present cigarette smoldering between 
               his lips, tongue-and-lips it up and backwards so that it is 
               inside his mouth, which he now closes.

               Marva Munson is heavily and carefully descending the stairs. 
               As the men come into view they are looking up at her, Lump 
               holding his sackbutt but still glistening with sweat and 
               smeared with dirt.

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON

                         of me.

               Lump looks around, saucer-eyed, then blows gamely into his 
               sackbutt. It sounds like goose farts until Dorr waves him 
               down.

<b>                                     DORR

                         a break anyway. The glissandi on 
                         this particular piece are technically 
                         very demanding and I think we would 
                         all welcome a moment of relaxation.

                         Why you sweatin' like that.

               It is directed at Lump, who looks down at his own sweat-
               stained undershirt.

               He untenses after what seemed like the final blow, but -- 
               WHAP! -- she slaps him again.

                         at times is so far transported by

               Dorr has her by the elbow and is ushering her back up the 
               stairs.

                         the proper words to express themselves 
                         and have recourse to--

               Gawain calls up the stairs:

               Dorr's tone is soothing as he shuts the door at the top of 
               the stairs.

                         fiery! A fact often remarked upon by

                         only came down to show you the fife.

               She hands him a thick, roughly whittled piece of cane. Dorr 
               holds it, looks at it dumbly. He is, for the first time that 
               we have seen anyway, non-plussed.

               Dorr tries to summon conversation as the two sit with their 
               backs to the fireplace:

               From Othar's POV, slightly high, we see them both twist in 
               their chairs to look up at the portrait.

               REVERSE of the portrait, LOW ANGLE. Othar looks down at us 
               with what appears to be bemusement.

               Marva Munson and Dorr gaze up at the portrait for a motionless 
               beat. At length, Marva Munson sighs:

               Dorr's eyes remain on the picture as he inquires:

               Prompted by her silence, he adds:

               Othar looks serenely down from his spot over the mantelpiece. 
               Marva Munson knits; G.H. Dorr sits nodding over an ancient 
               volume of half-forgotten lore, reading glasses perched midway 
               down his nose. Curtains waft lazily in the summer night

                         To me, paradoxically, the literature 
                         of the so-called "dead tongues" has 
                         more currency than this mornin's

               The Professor takes a small ticket envelope from where it 
               had served as bookmark, and hands it across.

               the floor.

               Gudge is opening a card that was inside the box. Its floral

               Pancake is on his stomach, wearing goggles, boring a hole 
               into a rock face with a power drill.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               We hear the whine of the drill faintly here, all but covered 
               by the sound of the chamber music on the boom box.

               The other men sit around. Dorr gives a casual glance at his 
               watch as the whine subsides.

               Pancake emerges from the tunnel covered with grime.

</b>                         The Freedom Riders, my fine young 
                         man, were a group of concerned 
                         liberals from up North -- whites, 
                         Negros, and yes, Jewish people -- 
                         all working together, just like we 
                         are here. Concerned citizens who 
                         came down here so that local black 
                         people could have their civil 
                         liberties. So that people like you 
                         could have the vote.

               All look at Pancake. Quiet, except for the delicate chamber 
               music.

               Gawain's tone softens:

               There is a knock on the cellar door. The men freeze 
               momentarily, then scramble for their instruments. The General 
               flips his cigarette backwards into his mouth.

               Dorr turns off the boom box, then calls:

               a large plate covered by a checked napkin.

               She takes the napkin off and carries the plate from person 
               to person; each obediently takes a cookie with a murmured 
               "Thank you, ma'am."

               They have reached the top of the stairs and the Professor 
               ushers her out but stays behind himself. He turns to address

               The room is filled with smoke.

               Othar, slightly askew over the mantel, looks a little huffy.

               We hear clomping and screaming on the cellar stairs.

               Lump bursts out, shrieking:

               The General comes bounding up the stairs like a panther, a 
               cigarette burning in his lips. He lands catlike in the living 
               room, glides to the blubbering Lump, grabs one shoulder firmly 
               with one hand, and with the other slaps him sharply, once 
               forehand, once backhand.

               Lump stares at him, shocked, his blubbering cut short.

               More noise is coming from the stairs:

               Pancake emerges from the stairwell, his hair singed, his 
               face and the front of his jumpsuit darkened by the blast. He 
               is clutching one hand with the other.

               Pancake is pale from loss of blood and his pontifications 
               lack full conviction:

               From the house there is very muted bellowing.

               Still looking toward the house, Mrs. Munson offers a word of

               The cat, with a human finger in its mouth, sidles cautiously 
               to one side, warily eying someone.

               The front door of the house opens. Lump, the Professor, and 
               Gawain emerge, escorting Pancake. Just before Gawain finishes 
               closing the door the cat slips out.

               The cat races across the lawn and, with no break in stride, 
               up his favorite tree.

               The General follows and, also without breaking stride, 
               clambers up the tree after it.

               Tree limbs shake with activity hidden by the leaves. We hear 
               the hiss of the cat.

               The men are bundling Pancake into the hearse. Dorr calls to

                         pinched his finger in a valve of the

               street, arms tensed, casts a look both ways, and then pursues 
               the animal down the road. We hear the retreating padding

               Gawain is wheeling it. He is approaching the tunnel to the

               Loud singing at the cut. We are looking at Mrs. Munson in 
               the middle of the choir, holding forth in song.

<b>               INT. CASINO - SERVICE HALL - DAY

               Gawain leans back against the wall next to the vault door, 
               arms folded across his chest. Faintly, from inside the vault, 
               we hear the whine of a power tool. Gawain leans over and 
               punches the button on boom box that hangs from the rolling 
               garbage bin. The hallway pulses with "I Left My Wallet In El

               More singing, Mrs. Munson and the rest of the choir now

               The power-tool whine is louder here. We are looking at a 
               patch of wall.

               After a beat, and with a loud rev as resistance gives way, a 
               drill bit emerges from the wall, spitting out bits of the 
               masonry.

               The drill withdraws.

               After a beat, hammer blows.

               The chunk of masonry begins to buckle.

               bags. An irregular hole, about three feet across, gapes in 
               the far wall.

               Gawain punches off the boombox, looking at all the money.

               He slips on his reading glasses as he gets a leg up on a 
               shelf just below the camera and hoists himself. He peers in

               He is fingering the back of the camera.

</b>                         ...Hard wire...

               Down below, Gawain looks at the wire snaking along the seam 
               of wall and ceiling. At the opposite corner it travels down 
               the joint of the two walls.

               He traces its path down and then across one wall at chair-
               rail height towards the door. The other men follow in an 
               anxious herd as he traces one finger along it.

               Just before reaching the vault door the wire goes through 
               the wall in a hole finished off with a grommet. Gawain goes 
               out the vault door...

</b>
               ...and picks up the line where it emerges on the other side, 
               travels down to the joint of wall and floor, and then 
               continues along the floor. Gawain follows it and the other 
               men continue to follow him.

               He traces it anxiously down the hall in a hunched lope. The 
               other men scuttle behind into...

<b>               INT. CASINO - MONITOR ROOM - DAY

               The wire winds around into the room, back up to chair-rail 
               height, along one wall, behind some cabinetry which Gawain 
               hurries past to find it again on the far side, and then down 
               to a video recorder.

               It is not, however, hooked up to the video recorder: its 
               pronged end swings loose just by where it would be plugged 
               in.

               Inside the video recorder is a casette, which Gawain ejects. 
               The men crowd to look over his shoulder as he examines it:

               "Shevann's Schvanz".

               There is a pile of other videos by the monitor: "Charlayne 
               and the Chocolate Factory," "Big Dick Blaque's Big Night 
               Out," "Lemme Tell Ya 'Bout Black Chicks," "Anus & Andy." 
               Just next to the pile is an old bowl of Kocoa Krispies.

               The General climbs into the tunnel with a garbage bagful of 
               money, followed by Lump, likewise encumbered. Lump hands 
               back out a satchel to Gawain, who sets it on the vault floor 
               by the hole. From the way he handles it, it is quite heavy. 
               Pancake, also with a bag of money, is getting ready to climb

               He drops to crawl position and elbows his way forward, 
               toolbelt clanking along.

               displaying timer with leads trailing off of it.

               He grabs it, puts on his reading glasses, squints.

               The display shows: TIME REMAINING: 00:12.

               The colons in the display rhythmically blink, but the number

               face.

               The readout now says: 00:10.

               --BOOM! We CUT TO the cellar and Pancake is shot out the 
               tunnel like a human cannonball, trailing a comet-tail of 
               dirt, dust, and debris that wafts what were neatly stacked 
               bills up into the air.

               The portrait of Othar jostles back to square. He now looks a 
               little angry.

               The cat arches her back, emitting a startled yowl.

               Mrs. Munson stands, frozen, then looks slowly around, trying 
               to assimilate what has just happened.

               Gawain and Elron are staring at each other, frozen, also 
               reacting to what just happened.

               Finally:

               Mrs. Munson is looking at the cellar door. Dust drifts out 
               from under it.

               She takes a slow step towards it. Another step. She opens 
               the door.

               There is no visibility in the cellar due to swirling clay 
               dust.

               She takes one step down the stairs, waving at the air in 
               front of her face.

               Paper money wafts in and out of the dust.

               We hear Voices:

               The clearing dust reveals the caped Professor anxiously 
               dancing from foot to foot, gathering money out of the air. 
               As he reaches up to grab a bill that has him facing up in 
               Mrs. Munson's direction, he freezes.

               His POV reveals her through dissipating dust.

</b>                         Professor, I'm surprised.

               There is a long beat, through which all stare at her.

               Further dissipation of the dust reveals how much money there 
               is, settling now to cover the floor of the cellar.

               We hear the ring of the doorbell.

               She points at the General who, in the excitement, has 
               neglected to hide his ever-present cigarette.

               She clomps upstairs and shuts the cellar door.

               We PULL HER towards the front door, angry and lost in thought. 
               Her look softens somewhat as she opens the door.

               It is a chattering infestation of hens: all of her friends 
               from church push in wearing church dresses and elaborate 
               hats.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - DAY

               The men are still frozen looking up toward the door. The 
               muted cackle of church ladies.

               The men gradually unfreeze.

               He turns to Dorr, near tears:

               Dorr rubs his hands anxiously, thinking:

                         the General's example...

               The General remains staring up at the door, frozen but for 
               the smoke pluming from the cigarette in his mouth.

               The gaze of all the men drifts back up to the cellar door, 
               and we look down at them, gazing up.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
               The chattering ladies are gathered at the table, Mrs. Munson 
               pouring them tea.

               The cellar door creaks noisily -- one might almost say 
               gothically -- ajar, and the Professor peers out with an 
               ingratiating smile.

               The chattering abates and the ladies all look at him. His 
               smile broadens into ghastliness and he crooks a finger toward 
               Mrs. Munson.

               He nods meekly and retreats, easing the door creakily shut.

               The ladies look inquisitively at Mrs. Munson as his footsteps 
               are heard descending the stair.

               As the Professor rejoins the still staring and silent group. 
               The money has been picked up and is once again in stacks 
               upon the table.

               Explaining, he indicates upstairs with a jerk of the head:

</b>                         ...Tea. Dainties.

               The men nod, murmuring.

               The cellar door squeaks open. There is the clomp of careful 
               footsteps on the stair.

               Using only tongue and teeth, the General flips his smoking 
               cigarette inwards into his mouth and gives Mrs. Munson his 
               usual deadpan look.

               She halts halfway down the stairs, still wearing an apron 
               and holding a spatula.

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON

                         know mischief when I see it. Now I 
                         want an explanation, but first I

                         music and they wanna hear you play.

               She turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to 
               turn and give the General a hard look which he innocently 
               returns.

               She turns again and clomps back up the stairs.

               The General opens his mouth and, again without using his 
               hands, restores his cigarette to its usual place on his lower 
               lip.

               Lump is fretful:

</b>                         You see Lump here is an enthusiastic 
                         collector of Indian arrowheads and, 
                         having found one simply lying on 
                         your cellar floor, a particularly 
                         rare artifact of the Natchez tribe, 
                         he enlisted us in an all-out effort 
                         to sift through the subsoil in search 
                         of others. Well, in doing so, we 
                         apparently hit a motherlode of natural 
                         gas -- I myself became acutely aware 
                         of the smell of "rotten eggs" -- and 
                         it was at just this unfortunate moment 
                         that the General here violated one 
                         of the cardinal rules of this house 
                         and lit himself a cigarette.

               The General stiffly bows:

               The Professor, nodding, smiling, and dry-washing his hands, 
               continues to look at Mrs. Munson, though his story, 
               apparently, has ended.

               She returns his ingratiating look with a stare.

                         in order to pay for the procedure 
                         that will correct the wandering eye 
                         of his common-law wife, Mountain

                         strabismus and a general curdling of 
                         the vitreous jelly. Mr. Pancake 
                         however is an ardent foe of the 
                         federal reserve and is in fact one 
                         of those eccentrics about whom one 
                         occasionally reads, hoarding his 
                         entire life savings either under the 
                         proverbial mattress or, as in Mr.

                         is his constant companion.

               Under her stare, he elaborates:

               something.

                         though, that so horrifies -- the

                         The only question is... who wields 
                         the weapon.

               He looks around the table. Silence. No volunteers.

               He takes a broom leaning against the wall, bends back and 
               snaps a handful of its bristles.

               Pancake grumbles as he counts out five bristles, takes one 
               and snaps it in half, displaying the short straw to the group, 
               and then hands the four long and one short to the Professor:

               With a flap of his cape the professor jumbles the straws and 
               encloses them in one hand.

               Sweaty CLOSE-UPS. Each man stares at the straws. Some 
               hesitant, some resolute, they draw:

               First, the General: long straw. His reaction: impassive.

               Next, Lump: long straw. His reaction: relieved.

               Next, Pancake. Long straw.

               Two straws left. Gawain stares at them, licks his lips.

               He reaches for one straw, touches it, hesitates.

               He touches the other straw, hesitates.

               He goes back to the first straw, closes his hand around it, 
               closes his eyes, and pulls.

               He lifts the straw into frame before his squeezed-shut eyes, 
               raises his eyebrows, and slowly opens fluttering eyelids to 
               look: short straw.

               The Professor, smiling, opens his fist to confirm that he 
               holds the last long one.

               Gawain moans.

<b>               PULLING HIM UP THE STAIRS
</b>
               Slowly, slowly, Gawain mounts the cellar stairs. Behind him, 
               gathered in a semi-circle and looking up from the foot of 
               the stairs, the other men wait.

               As he plants one plodding foot in front of the other Gawain 
               raises the gun, slides back its primer to make sure there is 
               a round in the chamber, and then slides it shut as he reaches 
               the door.

<b>               INT. MUNSON - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               In the foreground Mrs. Munson sits knitting, humming an old 
               temperance tune. In the background the cellar door swings 
               open. Marva Munson doesn't notice; her knitting needles 
               continue their rhythmic clack.

               We PULL Gawain, gun at the ready, as he takes slow, cautious 
               steps across the floor.

               We INTERCUT his POV of the back of the old lady's head, bowed 
               over her knitting.

               As Gawain passes the sofa he picks up a cushion and buries 
               in it his hand holding the gun.

               He looks back up at the old lady. But now, still cautiously 
               approaching, he cocks his head, his expression bemused.

<b>               HIS POV
</b>
               nearing the old lady is now different somehow. The perspective 
               is somewhat lower; the humming woman sounds not quite the 
               same; the rocking chair and the room itself are subtly 
               different.

<b>               WHEN WE CUT BACK TO GAWAIN
</b>
               he is a runty, TEN-YEAR-OLD CHILD walking slowly across the 
               floor; he is cradling not a gun in a pillow but a squirming 
               little puppy dog.

               The dog yips; the woman turns to look at us. It is not Mrs. 
               Munson, but another black woman of about the same age.

               commotion, have gathered excitedly to watch.

               Now it is the adult Gawain blubbering.

               The clack of knitting needles stops and Mrs. Munson turns to 
               look.

               He shoves Gawain.

               Pancake shoves:

               He lunges at him with a bear hug and his inertia sends both 
               men tumbling to the floor, where they roll and wrestle.

               Quiet.

               The two men have stopped rolling.

               They stare at each other where they lie, Pancake on top.

               At length:

               The men gather round and look down.

               Gawain still stares up at the ceiling.

               Pancake stoops, waves his hand in front of his eyes. No

</b>
               Creaking open. The Professor, Lump, and the General peek 
               out.

               The living room is empty but a sliver of the kitchen is 
               visible; its light is on, and we can hear water running.

               Dorr hisses:

</b>                         She is in the kitchen. I shall

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
               Dorr enters breezily; Mrs. Munson is at the sink, filling a 
               teapot.

               Dorr positions himself so that, to talk to him, Mrs. Munson 
               has her back to the living room.

<b>                                     DORR
</b>                         Well, my dear Mrs. Munson, I have 
                         outlined your position to my 
                         colleagues and I now return to you 
                         to return our collective verdict.

</b>                         Mm-hmm.

               Behind her, the General peers around the corner and starts a 
               catlike advance across the living room.

<b>                                     DORR
</b>                         There was much spirited discussion 
                         and an atmosphere of frank give-and-
                         take. Some of our number were 
                         initially appalled at your proposal 
                         that we simply return the money; 
                         some were more receptive.

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON
</b>                         I don't care they was receptive or 
                         not!

</b>                         And that attitude, madam, was a factor 
                         in our discussions. To a man, I must 
                         say, they were devastated at the 
                         prospect of not being able to 
                         contribute to their respective 
                         charities.

               The General signals to Lump who now crosses the living room 
               with a big garbage bag slung over one shoulder in a fireman's 
               carry.

</b>                         Indeed. But at the end of the day, 
                         your position prevailed, and the men 
                         have decided that we shall return 
                         the money -- every last cent of it! -- 
                         and attend Sunday services, rather 
                         than spend the remainder of our years 
                         wasting away in the Mississippi Men's 
                         Correctional Facility. Though that 
                         was the original preference of some.

                         light, anyway. I'm gonna have some 
                         tea and go to bed.

               The Professor, seeing that the General and Lump have made it 
               out the door, is anxious to wind things up:

<b>                                     DORR
</b>                         So the money shall be returned 
                         tomorrow at the opening of the casino 
                         office. Enjoy your tea, madam...

               Backing out, he looks to one side.

               Through the living room window he can see the hearse pulling 
               away from the curb. There is another car -- an old Volkswagon 
               microbus -- slowly tooling the opposite way down the street.

               Dorr looks back to Mrs. Munson.

               We are at the middle of the bridge, the tower gargoyle looking 
               blankly down at the doings below.

               In the misty night Lump and the General are braced over the 
               railing, looking down, each holding one of the feet that 
               protrude from the Hefty bag cinched around Gawain's ankles. 
               A cigarette burns on the General's lower lip. Behind the two 
               men we can see the idling hearse.

               There is the toot of the garbage scow. Lump and the General 
               release Gawain's feet.

               Their POV shows the sack receding and flumping into the 
               garbage piled onto the scow that slips by below.

               A flock of scavenger birds, disturbed by the impact, lifts 
               off the scow with angry caws.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Dorr skulks at a corner of the living room's picture window, 
               peering out at the street.

               The Volkswagon microbus again cruises slowly down the street 
               in the same direction as previously; apparently it has been 
               circling.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The Professor scowls.

               The hearse pulls up to the curb.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT
</b>
               The Professor clomps down the cellar stairs. Pancake is 
               loading their digging implements into a satchel.

               Dorr is absent:

</b>                         Yes... yes, they just arrived.

               Pancake straightens from the satchel.

               He mounts the stairs with a satchel in either hand. We can 
               hear the front door opening as the other men enter.

               Dorr, bemused, but apparently moved by a hunch, advances 
               slowly to the sackbutt case.

               He slides the catch that lets its spring clasp pop up.

               He lifts the lid.

               Mother Jones magazine. Piles of Mother Jones magazines.

               He riffles a pile, confirming that it is in fact all magazine, 
               no money.

               Lump and the General are clomping down the stairs.

               We are PULLING Clark down the street, a satchel in either 
               hand.

               The microbus, parked halfway down the block, ominously idling.

<b>               THE BUS
</b>
               We are CLOSE on its side-view mirror. Someone leans from the 
               driver's seat for a view into the mirror, and in the mirror 
               we see her, pigtails swinging: Mountain Girl.

               street.

               PULLING him again. A smile is beginning to play at the corners 
               of his mouth.

               The smile abruptly fades.

               He stops in his tracks for no discernible reason. At length:

               He pants.

               Behind him, in the deep background, we see the General 
               bounding into the street and silently toward us.

</b>                         ...Oof!

               The moment passes. Pancake shakes his head, as if to clear 
               it, and resumes his walk.

<b>               HIS POV

               We are nearing the bus.

               Mountain Girl sits in the idling bus, waiting.

               With a thunk and a gentle rock of the bus, we hear its back 
               doors opening, and Pancake's voice.

               We hear an oof! of exertion as Pancake hoists each of the 
               two satchels into the back. The oofs are followed by:

               The tower gargoyle stares sightlessly down.

               Lump and the General are at their accustomed place, each 
               holding a foot shod in a large hiking boot.

               Behind them we see the hearse idling.

               Near them on the bridge, both hands grasping the railing as 
               he gazes dreamily out into the night, is the Professor.

               With three protruding straws.

               Lump picks a long straw: relief.

               The General picks a short straw. A short grunt.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Mrs. Munson lies on her back gently snoring. At the open 
               window, sheers ripple in the evening breeze.

               A large clock ticks upon the mantle. It is almost one o'clock.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>               THE CELLAR DOOR
</b>
               It creaks open. The General looks stealthily out. A cigarette 
               in his mouth plumes smoke.

               He pushes the door fully open, emerges.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Mrs. Munson's snore catches on an inhale. She mutters 
               something, sighs, and resumes snoring.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</b>
               The General treads lightly, noiselessly, up the stairway 
               leading to the second floor. He slides one hand into his 
               jacket, pulls out a garotte.

               With the faintest whoosh he whips it in a complicated loop 
               and snags the other handle with his other hand.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               The General emerges from the staircase and advances on the 
               closed bedroom door. As he reaches for the knob he performs 
               the no-handed flip of the burning cigarette into his mouth.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - MRS. MUNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               The door swings noiselessly open. The General pauses to 
               survey:

               The still room. The ticking clock. Mrs. Munson, a large 
               sleeping mound upon the bed.

               The General advances, raising the garotte in both hands.

               He closes on her sleeping form.

               The garotte is lowered toward her exposed neck.

               It is a foot -- half a foot -- inches-away...

               Somewhere a muted gear ratchets and triggers the toll of--

               The clock, striking one. It is a cuckoo clock but, instead 
               of a bird emerging, a berobed Jesus comes out with his hand 
               resting on the head of a child who gazes up in adoration.

               The General starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes, 
               his eyes widening.

               Jesus retreats back into the clock.

               The General has swallowed his cigarette.

               He reaches up to his throat, panicked. In a silent frenzy, 
               he yanks loose his ascot.

               He gazes wildly about.

               He reaches for the water glass at Mrs. Munson's bedside.

               He tips it back into his mouth. There is a rattling sound.

<b>               HIS POV
</b>
               The uptilted water glass is sending false teeth -- full uppers 
               and lowers -- rattling toward his face.

<b>               THE GENERAL
</b>
               He frantically -- but still noiselessly -- sets the glass 
               back down. Wildly looks about, one hand clamped to his throat.

               A mad but silent dash for the door.

               Plunging for the head of the stairs--

               --a brief yowl from the cat--

               --recoiling from where its tail has been stepped on, a hiss 
               and a flash of its claws at the General's leg--

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - STAIRCASE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               --and he falls down the stairs, each thudding impact bouncing 
               his body like a rag doll's.

               At the bottom of the stairs he lies still.

               A CLOSE-UP shows his head bent at an unnatural angle, 
               unblinking eyes staring. Traces of smoke wisp from each 
               nostril and his open mouth.

               Over the mantle, Othar returns the dead man's stare. He looks 
               somewhat smug.

<b>               INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT

               The Professor and Lump, responding to the noise, look slowly 
               up toward the ceiling.

               The body is laid out in a garbage bag by the rail.

               The Professor stands looking at it, contemplatively.

               Lump stands looking at it, contemplatively.

               The cat sits nearby on its haunches looking at it, 
               impassively.

               The professor muses:

               There is the toot! of an approaching scow. Dorr's manner is 
               still absent, his regard still on the corpse:

               He rouses himself, goes over to the bagged corpse. Lump 
               follows him and the two men hoist the body over the rail.

               He goes to the railing to look down.

               Lump, face-up on a pile of garbage, glides away. Disturbed 
               birds flap upward.

               The professor muses:

               His gaze rises with the ascending birds.

               Among the white gulls is one black bird. The Professor eyes 
               it as it rises past him.

               we look down on the Professor, the black bird rising to perch 
               on the gargoyle on the suspension tower in the foreground.

               The bird settles on a loose, teetering piece of masonry.

<b>               BACK TO THE PROFESSOR

               looking at the receding red light on the bridge of the 
               receding scow:

               The teetering chunk of masonry tips away and the perchless 
               bird flaps off.

<b>               BACK TO THE PROFESSOR
</b>
               very dreamy: he sees something in the distance, beyond time 
               and space:

<b>                                     DORR

                         Are Holy land!"

               This is punctuated by the crunching impact of masonry scoring 
               a direct hit on his head. He falls over the rail.

               His cape snags on the railing and he hangs limp and lifeless. 
               Directly below his dangling body the stern of Lump's barge 
               is slipping away to leave black waters and the clanking of 
               chains.

               The fabric of the Professor's cape begins to tear. His body 
               drops in fits and starts as the fabric gives way.

               Finally the body rips free. It falls away from us. As it 
               does so the clanking chains are pulling into view the second-
               banger -- a garbage barge being chain-towed by the receding 
               scow.

               Dorr's body lands neatly on the barge.

               A gust of wind.

               The cape flaps free of the railing and is wind-tossed away 
               amidst the cawing birds.

               The cat, watching, blinks.

               It is resting on the very edge of the night table --

               Money stacked neatly on the card table.

               Mrs. Munson sadly shakes her head.

               Mrs. Munson is climbing the porch in her Sunday best. She 
               feints at the dog who lies curled in the sun:

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON
</b>                         Scoot now! Outa the way!

<b>               INT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY
</b>
               The sheriff is busy on the phone; there is a DEPUTY today 
               also on the phone. The sheriff, seeing Mrs. Munson enter, 
               covers the phone with one hand.

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON
</b>                         Sheriff, I gotta make a statement.

<b>                                     SHERIFF WYNER
</b>                         Could it possibly wait, ma'am? We're 
                         a little busy today.

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON
</b>                         I guess it can wait, but it's about 
                         that casino money.

               The sheriff exchanges a significant look with the deputy, 
               then murmurs into the phone:

<b>                                     SHERIFF WYNER
</b>                         Call you right back.

               He cradles the phone and smiles at Mrs. Munson.

<b>                                     SHERIFF WYNER

                         dollars. Down in my root cellar. All 
                         stacked up nice and neat.

               The deputy pauses to look up from his phone:

                         played the sackbutt and so on -- 
                         well, it turns out they really 
                         couldn't play, although they could 
                         recite poems to break your heart.

                         up and left without takin' the money.

               The sheriff sighs.

               He and the deputy exchange looks. The sheriff looks back at 
               Mrs. Munson.

               Mrs. Munson is walking home. It is a beautiful spring day.

               From far off, wafting toward us on the breeze, we can hear 
               the church chorus singing. Mrs. Munson joins in. She has a 
               strong voice:

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON
</b>                         Leaning, Leaning, Safe and secure 
                         from all harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean 
                         on Jesus, Leaning on the everlasting 
                         arm.

               She turns up the walk to her house.

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON
</b>                         ...What a fellowship, What a peace 
                         of mind, Safe and secure from all 
                         harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus, 
                         Leaning on the everlasting arm...

               When she opens the front door the cat slips out.

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON
</b>                         ...Pickles!

               It races off down the street.

<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON
</b>                         ...Pickles!

<b>               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
               Pickles scurries along the walkway. We hear the toot! of an 
               approaching scow.

               The cat reaches the middle of the bridge. He sticks his head 
               through the bars of the railing.

               When we CUT CLOSE on the cat as he looks down at the water, 
               we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger.

               As the scow passes underneath, the cat opens its mouth and 
               lets the finger drop.

               The finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it 
               hits the scow.

               The cat looks up INTO THE LENS, and blinks. Its sideways 
               irises adjust.

               The scow is gliding away. With the low mournful toot of its 
               horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where 
               scavenger birds pick through the trash.
