</b><b>          INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a
          nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas.
<b>          
</b>          A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze
          button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.
<b>          
</b>          Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the
          FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes,
          also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser.
<b>          
</b>          LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music.
          She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are
          arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the
          panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty
          pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her
          nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties.
<b>          
</b>          Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen
          suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the
          bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off
          her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.
<b>          
</b><b>                               LETTY
</b>                     Listen, Beast. What have I told
                     you about linen?
<b>          
</b>          The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that
          SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the
          hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
</b><b>          
</b>          Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS "Urge Overkill"
          from the counter and checks the time against her watch.
<b>          
</b>          She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food
          arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the
          middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can.
<b>          
</b><b>                               LETTY
</b>                         (looking at Beast)
                     It's liver saute.
<b>          
</b>          Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can.
<b>          
</b><b>                               LETTY
</b><b>          
</b>                     Fine, then, chicken in gravy. But
                     you're going to have to eat the
                     liver tomorrow.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                      2.

</b><b>          
</b>          Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls
          back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair
          spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the
          voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
</b><b>          
</b>          Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is
          mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat
          good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch
          pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door.
          She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to
          turn the handle.
<b>          
</b>          Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody
          nose, runs up to her, bawling.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHANDRA
</b>                    Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.
<b>          
</b>          Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door.
<b>          
</b><b>                              LETTY
</b>                        (to Chandra)
                    Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip
                    your head back.
<b>          
</b>          She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off
          balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel,
          staining it for all eternity.
<b>          
</b>          Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and
          guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.
<b>          
</b><b>                              LETTY
</b>                    Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch
                    it.

</b><b>          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
</b><b>          
</b>          PRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with
          BILL JOHANSEN, the 50-something school Superintendent. Also
          present are MRS. MONTES, who is a School Board Member, and
          two other BOARD MEMBERS.
<b>          
</b>          Principal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her
          foot. Johansen clears his throat.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                     3.

                    and I'm afraid...
<b>          
</b>          The door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She
          clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her
          blood-smeared lapel.
<b>          
</b><b>                              LETTY
</b>                    Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry
                    I'm late. It's very nice to meet
                    you.
<b>          
</b>          Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending
          down to shake hands with Johansen and the others.

</b><b>                              LETTY

</b><b>                              LETTY
</b>                    A bloody nose...
<b>          
</b>          There is no response. Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase
          and reveals the stain.
<b>          
</b><b>                              LETTY

</b>          Johansen smiles.

</b>          A bunch of BOYS play kickball in a haze of sawdust. Chandra
          sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. JENNY, a
          limber 8-year-old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym.
<b>          
</b>          Letty talks on her CELL PHONE. She glances around to monitor
          her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball
          game.

<b>          
</b>          Letty dials again. She sees two boys fighting over the ball
          and moves in to break them up.

</b>          Tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the
          patrons dare speak only in hushed tones. Letty sits sipping
          wine with her mother, MRS. MARTHA MAYER, immaculate in a
          cream suit, young looking for her 50-odd years.

<b>          
</b>          Letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. Zach freezes.
          He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and,
          above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at
          him.

          ominously down his cheek.

</b>          Zach wrests free of Letty. He's in full cry now. He backs
          away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. Bobby
          SNICKERS at Zach's misfortune. Other children glance around,
          unsure, confused.

</b>          Letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and
          looks at the children again.

</b>          She sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands.
          Letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. She takes a
          deep breath and raises her head.

<b>          
</b>          Zach continues to cry. Letty looks down at her desk. She
          grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste.

</b>          Letty jumps up. She slaps the paper on the wall with some
          paste. She motions for the students to join her.

</b>          The children slowly approach her. Zach lags behind.

</b>          Letty opens her drawer to pull out a T-shirt. Several are
          rumpled. She starts refolding them when she spots it.

</b>          There, nestled among her clothes, is a book of Emily
          Dickinson's poetry. Letty picks it up, runs her hand over
          the cover and starts reading.

</b>          Paul and Letty walk onto a postcard-perfect stone terrace
          overlooking the garden. Paul pulls up a chair for Letty and
          stares out at the scenery.

</b>          Every inch of every pew in the Baroque church is stuffed with
          guests. Michael sits in the second row. He cranes his head
          around as "Pachelbel's Canon" RINGS OUT and the FLOWER GIRL

</b>          advances.
<b>          
</b>          Letty, in the first part of the bride's maids' procession,
          heads down the aisle next. The bride is nowhere in sight.
<b>          
</b>          But even so, as soon as Michael spots Letty, he stands.
          Everyone else remains seated. They look at him. Michael
          doesn't notice. He has eyes only for Letty.
<b>          
</b>          Letty's mother looks at Michael with more than annoyance.
          Begrudgingly, she also stands.
<b>          
</b>          Following the lead, the entire church stands for Letty.    She
          smiles at Michael.

          Mr. Mayer, Monica, Letty, Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Jake.
<b>          
</b>          Michael hovers close to Letty. AUNT LILY, with fluorescent
          red hair and a silver lame miniskirt, spots him.

</b>          Letty and Ruth overhear this. They make eye contact.   Ruth
          raises her eyebrows toward Letty. Letty smiles back.

                    hard?

<b>          
</b>          Letty waits. She looks away. She turns back and stares into
          Michael's eyes. Finally, she says it.

                    right now.
<b>          
</b>          Letty starts to cry.   Tears well up in Michael's eyes.

                    care of yourself.
<b>          
</b>          Michael puts his hand under Letty's chin and draws her head
          up so he can look into her eyes.

<b>          
</b>          Letty shakes her head "no" as tears stream down her face.

</b>          Letty stands up and walks toward the door. She comes back
          and embraces Michael again. Slowly, they separate, and Letty
          leaves the room. Michael stares out the window.
