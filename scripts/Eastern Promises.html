<b>1   EXT. A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1
</b>
    It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The
    scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.
    A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish
    newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional
    barber's shop called Ozim's.

</b>
    The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)
    is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).
    Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit
    beneath the barber's gown.

    During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and
    star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.

    Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks
    with a Russian accent.

<b>                           OZIM

              kids, you know... he says - `but
              Amca it's Christmas?... Christmas!
              We're Islam!

<b>                          SOYKA
</b>              Oi, how much are you taking off?

<b>                          OZIM

              alisverise cimac. The kid's
              sixteen...

    Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and
    Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet
    near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.

<b>                          OZIM (CONT'D)

                   interrupting)
              Uncle Ozim.......

    We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear
    as well as cold.

                 about.

    Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem
    in the mirror.

<b>                             SOYKA
</b>                 He looks OK to me... how you doin'
                 Ekrem?

    Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it
    as if it were enchanted...

                 one lousy thing for me. Here,
                 look... Ekrem, take this...

    Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic
    bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally
    terrified.

    Soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's
    gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open
    the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream
    bubbles in the blood.

    We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off
    in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We
    pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are
    hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA)
    hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown
    with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair
    is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop.
    She is barefoot.

    The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER.
    Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the
    customer react to her ragged appearance.

    The customer looks at Tatiana's feet and reacts. We see
    blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then
    faints onto the floor.

    We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting
    through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar
    hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a
    JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two
    PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley.

</b>
    A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse.
    Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The
    theater is full of people in scrubs, including an
    anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double
    speed.

    We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering
    needle marks.

    A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and
    we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....

                 Baby's very distressed.

    Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the
    contents of the bag. We see a business card from a
    restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher
    necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.

    Cut to Anna at Tatiana's head.    Anna strokes her face and
    speaks softly.

    THE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter
    panic as he attempts to free the baby.

    The doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid
    thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop. As he enters...

    All hell is let loose. As the Caesarean process begins at
    frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious
    face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice
    speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between
    nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.

</b>                 My name is Tatiana. My father

                 died. We were all buried there.
                 Buried under the soil of Russia.
                 That is why I left to find a better
                 life.

    We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed
    shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek.

    A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the
    screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her
    bloody wrist.

    in Anna's bedroom where the curtains are drawn. Anna is

     The living room table is laid for dinner. Uncle Stepan is
     early seventies, Russian. He is reading the tiny diary
     that Anna found in Tatiana's bag. Anna breezes in.

     Stepan grumbles, accustomed to this teasing.

     Helen enters carrying a bowl of walnuts and brazil nuts
     which she places on the table.

     Stepan leaves in a huff. Anna picks up the diary and begins
     to study it. She sees the `Trans-Siberian' business card
     between the pages.

     Driving music as we see Anna riding her motorbike through
     deserted morning streets again. We should begin to sense
     that this is a kind of release for her. We hear Tatiana
     in V.O.

     Anna arrives outside the `Trans-Siberian' restaurant. It
     has a Russian-themed frontage in blue and gold, expensively
     and recently finished.

     As Anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark.

<b>13   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY               13
</b>
     The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome
     Russian man (NIKOLAI), who stops to groom his hair back
     from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges
     into daylight. He steps into a small courtyard, where a
     fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of
     a chain.

     Nikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger,
     slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in
     a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy
     night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill
     yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian
     curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.

                  here.

     He glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly.

</b>                  Then I'll think of an excuse and

     Kirill grins and Nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys.
     The lights on an expensive black Mercedes glow in response.
     Kirill notices Anna locking up her bike at the front of
     the restaurant.

     They both see Anna removing her crash helmet and shaking
     out her hair. She walks towards the front door.

     Kirill sees that Nikolai is studying Anna and his grin
     fades. We sense jealousy.

     Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a
     playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than
     playfulness. Nikolai gets into his car.

     Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the
     restaurant.

     As Nikolai drives away, Anna rings the doorbell beside the
     front door. There is no reply. She is about to ring again
     when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his
     late sixties. He is wiping his hands on a tea towel,
     dressed in a spotlessly white apron. He has the sparkling
     piercing eyes of a falcon.

     The tables are set for a huge party. Kirill is now on

     Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam,
     smoke. Family members, some dressed in their party outfits,
     others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots,
     laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost
     smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all,
     overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas
     kitchen. Semyon calls out to everyone.

     Anna reaches into her pocket and produces the `Trans-

     angles his head to look as he stirs.

               the name. Perhaps she ate here
               once. Try this.

     Semyon offers Anna a spoonful of his gravy.    She sips it.

     Nikolai's black Mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant
     and parks a few inches from Anna's motorbike. The rear

     door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in

     silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen.

     Anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place.
     Finally Semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap
     of paper.

<b>                              SEMYON
</b>                  This is an agency that hires casual
                  kitchen staff. Maybe you will
                  have more luck there. But I think
                  they will be closed until New Year.

     As Anna takes the address, Kirill puts his head around
     the door and yells through the noise.

<b>                              KIRILL
</b>                  Papa, Ozim is here.

     Semyon is alarmed and claps his hand in urgent fashion.

                  tell him I am coming.

     Semyon takes a pot from the heat, suddenly flustered.

     There is the tiniest of changes in Semyon's manner.        He
     lays his heavy pot down.

     a pan onto the heat then re-emerges.

</b>                  Why did you not tell me you found

     He peers at her for a moment, his eyes hardening a little.

     Semyon hoists a passing child into his arms.

     Semyon goes back to stirring but as he stirs he calls out.

     Kirill and Ozim are talking confidentially in a mix of
     Russian and Turkish whispers at a table. Ozim's wife is
     at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a
     cigarette and peeling glazed figs. As Anna walks by, Ozim
     and Kirill stop talking. The scene has a much darker mood
     to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now Anna
     feels no unease. As she passes, Kirill surveys her with a
     deadly smile and a professional eye.

     Anna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that
     four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various
     ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with
     their children are emerging from their cars. The women are
     all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear
     leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly
     as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels
     slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees
     Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking,
     still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's
     bike.

     Anna has already taken a dislike to this man. He is
     arrogant and looks potentially violent. His shades, suit
     and tattoos say it all.

      In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna
      approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is
      tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of
      the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another
      world.

      Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There
      we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin
      to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.

</b>
      The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and
      cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests
      and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing
      violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish
      mixed. Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table.
      His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel
      to answer it.

      When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and
      moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides
      his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and
      holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.

     one of the violin-playing angels, smiles, and kisses her
     on both cheeks.

     The rooms above Ozim's shop have been converted into a
     drinking club. Ozim leads Nikolai and Kirill through the
     debris of the night before. As they walk through, Ekrem
     suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell. Kirill
     and Nikolai both react with instinctive aggression.

     Ekrem nods and hugs Ozim. We realize he is slightly

     watches him go.

     in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka.

     Kirill reaches into his pocket and produces an envelope

     begins to count the huge wad of cash, Kirill turns to
     Nikolai.

     Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface, his
     head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound
     up similarly. Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand
     with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which
     has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and
     jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood.
     Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves.

     As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is
     watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms
     folded, mightily impressed.

     Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove
     the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers
     it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a
     contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns
     the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the
     crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel
     of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within
     a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening,
     thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens
     it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows
     hot air onto the money inside.

     He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all
     stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this
     money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously.
     Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai
     as if he were a devil from hell.

     Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it,
     then pockets the frozen wad. He tosses the rest of the
     frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it.

     of it, drops the thing on the floor. Nikolai looks at
     Ozim as if he were a complete amateur.

     photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles.

                  and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will
                  translate it.

     He folds the papers carefully.

     There is nothing in Semyon's smile to cause alarm but Anna
     perhaps remembers Nikolai. Finally...

     Semyon doesn't blink. At that moment a little girl of
     seven (MARIA) emerges from the darkness, carrying a soft
     toy.

               for another hundreds and hundreds
               of days.

     Semyon takes her onto his knee. As he does, we see, for
     the first time, an eagle tattoo on his wrist.

<b>                           SEMYON
</b>               But you have had so many presents.

     The girl wafts Semyon's cigar smoke.

</b>               You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa.

     Semyon cuddles Maria and stubs his cigar.

     Anna smiles at the warm family scene, perhaps remembering
     her own father.

     Nikolai gets out of the Mercedes and helps an extremely
     pissed Kirill out of the car into the rain. Kirill is so
     drunk he slips through Nikolai's hands and lands in the
     gutter.

     Nikolai manages to lift him to his feet again. As they
     head towards the restaurant, Anna emerges. Nikolai looks
     up, curious, as Semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the
     doorway. As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses
     in front of her. Nikolai looks up at Anna, his face
     splashed with rain.

</b>                  What? You never seen anybody pissed
                  before?

     Semyon looks down at the drunken Kirill and slams the door
     of the restaurant. Nikolai sighs, then turns to Kirill
     and starts to go through his pockets.

</b>                  Come on, Kirill. Where are your

     Anna walks around the two of them, watching the undignified
     struggle as Nikolai finds Kirill's keys. Nikolai smiles
     at her.

</b>                  Who are you, anyway?

     Anna hurries away into the rain. Nikolai finds Kirill's
     keys and drags him toward the door of the restaurant.

     Nikolai heaves Kirill into a chair. Semyon is back at his
     novel and watches as Kirill attempts to get to his feet
     and then stumbles to the floor. He slumps down, now
     totally unconscious, breathing deeply. Nikolai smiles.

     Semyon steps up to where Kirill is lying and stands over
     him for a moment. Then he kicks him hard in the guts with
     all his might. Nikolai is shocked, and grabs Semyon's
     arm. A hand laid upon him is like deadly poison. Kirill
     grunts and moans.

     Nikolai steps in between Semyon and Kirill. Semyon is
     shocked that anyone should face him like this.

     Nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and
     offers it to Semyon. As Semyon looks at the card in the
     candle light, he also sees the TATTOO OF AN EAGLE on
     Nikolai's hand.

     It is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to
     Semyon, and he reacts.

     then peers at his drunken, sleeping son with something
     approaching compassion.

     Nikolai hurries   out to his car in the rain. He hears an
     engine splutter   and spots Anna still trying to kick-start
     her motorbike.    He approaches. She's already soaked.
     Nikolai watches   her try to start the bike and fail.

     Anna tries one more time to start the bike and growls with
     fury. Nikolai gently takes her shoulders and after a brief
     resistance Anna climbs off the bike. Nikolai sits astride
     it. He kicks it. It fails to start. Anna folds her arms.

      A large tent has been erected over the body of Soyka. Inside
      the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a
      third man, a specialist from the Russian desk (YURI), who
      is not dressed for the weather. He has obviously been
      dragged out of bed. He is led to the side of the body.
      One of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows
      him the eagle tattoo.

</b>                We think he might be Russian Mafia.

      Yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. He crouches
      to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg.
      When the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small
      star tattooed on the knee cap.

<b>                            YURI
</b>                He is actually a Chechen. He is

                The stars on the knees mean he
                would never kneel before anyone.

      Yuri opens the dead man's shirt and we see a tattoo of an
      eight-pointed star on his chest.

      The officer holds up a small zip-lock bag which has a
      handwritten note sealed inside it. The handwriting is just
      visible through the wet cellophane.

     A large portable stereo is playing rock music.

     The curtains are drawn against daylight. The living room
     is decorated in seventies suburban style, but with the
     wall paper peeling and the paint work fading. Kitsch
     paintings still decorate the walls.

     Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down
     sofa and on hard-backed chairs, wearing short skirts. Their
     eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but
     they are painted with so much make-up they almost look
     like tiny, sad clowns.

     They sit in silence as the music blares out. After a few
     moments a young Albanian man enters and claps his hands.

     All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet
     and begin to dance to the music, their bodies moving
     awkwardly and painfully. The Albanian approaches the one
     girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet.

     He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian. She tries
     to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again.

     Kirill suddenly goes to the stereo system and yanks the

     The only sound is the sobbing of the girl who won't dance.

     Nikolai is fucking the girl, who is now silent.   She is on
     all fours, registering no emotion.

     Kirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the
     bottle, watching Nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and
     drunken jealousy mixing together. Nikolai grits his teeth
     and comes inside the girl. Kirill whoops and whistles and
     begins to applaud.

     The girl is still silent, expressionless.

     Kirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before
     leaving. Finally alone, Nikolai gently helps the girl to
     lie down. She is numb. He covers her up with a blanket
     then begins to pull on his clothes. The girl is staring up
     at the ceiling.

     After a few moments she begins to sing a Russian folk song
     softly under her breath. Nikolai speaks to her softly in
     Russian.

</b><b>     NIGHT
</b>
     In the half-lit private room, Anna is dancing with Christine
     in her arms. She is singing a lullaby softly to her. The
     door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other
     babies are silent.

     Finally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib.
     She sits down on the bed where the mother should be. She
     curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined
     to pull herself together.

     As she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward,
     she is suddenly confronted by Semyon.

     He is standing in the shadows, a Bavarian trilby in his
     hands. Anna gasps with shock. Semyon speaks softly...

     tries to remain detached. Helen also tries hard to
     concentrate on her task but wipes away a tear as she writes.

     Stepan heads for the kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle
     of vodka. Rather than admonish him, Anna and Helen both
     nod agreement. Stepan pours three large vodkas. Stepan
     knocks his down. Anna and Helen take sips.

     Stepan stares at them both for a long time.   Finally he

     Nikolai pulls up in his car. He checks his look in the
     rear view mirror and puts on his sunglasses. As he gets
     out of the car he notices that Anna's motorbike is still
     there. He approaches it, strokes the bodywork. Suddenly,
     someone grabs him from behind. It's Kirill.

     A white van is parked with its rear doors open, ready for
     unloading. Kirill shows Nikolai that the van is loaded
     with unmarked white boxes.

     vintage champagne.

     them.

     floor. Kirill recoils in terror. Nikolai straightens,
     faces up.

     Anna and Helen are sitting at a table, terrified but trying
     hard to stay calm. Stepan arrives with a tray of coffees
     and a burger. He sits, and Anna and Helen glance uneasily
     at each other. Stepan begins to eat noisily.

<b>                              ANNA
</b>                  How the hell can you eat?

     There is a tension that builds until Nikolai's Mercedes
     suddenly looms into view, filling the street window of the
     burger bar. Nikolai gets out of his car, all shades and
     sharp suit.

<b>                              ANNA
</b>                  That's their driver.

     pocket.

                  ridiculous...

     Stepan removes his hand, empty, his bravado crushed.

     Nikolai enters the restaurant and spots Anna. He comes
     and sits at the table beside Stepan, opposite Anna. It's
     a tight squeeze. Anna and Helen are stiff with terror.
     Nikolai smiles.

     Tatiana's diary and hands it to Nikolai. Nikolai studies
     it and nods. He gets to his feet...

     Passers-by stare at Anna. Helen and Stepan have come out
     of the restaurant to restrain her. Nikolai stops and judges
     the fury on Anna's face. He speaks calmly.

     Anna and Nikolai are staring at each other, suddenly a
     strange connection between them.

     Then Stepan steps forward and spits in Nikolai's face,
     delivering a Russian curse as he does so. Nikolai almost
     reacts out of instinct but stops himself.

     Nikolai wipes his face and peers into Anna's eyes.       Finally
     he gets into his car and drives away.

     Nikolai is alone, sitting at a candlelit table, reading
     Tatiana's diary. We hear Tatiana in voice-over...

     He sees Semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the
     diary. Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his
     way to sit opposite Nikolai. Nikolai pushes the diary
     across the table. Semyon pours two drinks.

     Nikolai senses a change of attitude towards him. As if
     Semyon were beginning to accept him into the fold. Semyon
     raises a toast.

</b>                  A little village outside St.
                  Petersburg. I know it. Not much
                  of a place for a kid to grow up
                  in. Especially not a girl.

     She hesitates.       Nikolai approaches and gives her the
     address.

</b>                  If you want my opinion, the kid
                  would be better off in London.
                  Maybe with you. Why not? Tatiana's
                  family don't sound like the kind
                  of people who'd want another mouth
                  to feed.

     A pause.

     Crowds of football supporters are streaming away from the
     football stadium, where the floodlights are still casting
     their glow. There are Arsenal and Chelsea supporters on
     opposite sides of the street and there is some mildly
     vicious yelling between the two groups. Police are visibly

     Among the crowd we see Ekrem. He seems slightly drunk on
     top of his normal craziness. He has an Arsenal scarf around
     his neck and is looking for trouble, jeering at the Chelsea
     supporters across the street.

     A policeman steps up to Ekrem and gives him a shove and he
     stumbles a little. As he gets to his feet we notice TWO
     CHECHEN MEN who are trailing Ekrem, ducking their heads
     away from the line of policemen.

     Ekrem is now isolated from the crowds, swigging from a can
     of lager. He is chanting `Arsenal, Arsenal' to himself as
     he walks. He stops to take a piss on someone's grave.

     In the background the two Chechens are coming closer. As
     Ekrem zips his flies, the Chechens are upon him. One of
     them grabs his Arsenal scarf and begins to strangle him.

     Ekrem chokes for a while and the Chechen loosens the knot.
     The second Chechen pulls out an open razor. Ekrem struggles
     to escape...

     The place has two dozen customers and there is a Russian
     band playing `Dark Eyes'. At a particular table an old
     Russian lady is having her birthday celebrated by an adoring

     There is a huge round of applause as Semyon emerges from

     Semyon emerges into the wine crates and beer bottles in
     the yard at the back of the restaurant where the Doberman
     is straining at the leash, snarling and barking. An already
     anxious Ozim is cowering in the shadows, held at bay by
     the dog.

     The moment Semyon steps out the dog stops barking. Ozim
     relaxes a little and steps forward. Semyon pets the dog.

     Semyon suddenly breaks the neck of the bottle and holds
     the jagged edge to Ozim's throat. The dog snarls at
     Semyon's feet.

     A large public housing estate is being swept by rain.
     Christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated

     Kirill and Nikolai stop. A swell of laughter from the
     restaurant. Anna is about to continue but Nikolai steps
     forward and places two fingers on Anna's lips to stop her
     from saying anymore. Anna tears his hands from her mouth.

     At the same time Kirill yells in Russian.

     Anna is terrified but angry too.    She yells.

     He goes for Anna again, and this time Nikolai shoves Kirill
     to the wet ground. He looks up at Nikolai and slowly gets
     to his feet. He wipes his hands then stares into Nikolai's
     eyes.

     The place is winding up. Chefs and waiters are cleaning
     surfaces and dishes. The only still point is Semyon, who
     is cutting and wrapping the birthday cake in small parcels
     of golden paper. He works intensely and delicately at the
     back of the kitchen. Nikolai and Kirill enter. Kirill
     swigs a half-drunk glass of wine.

     Semyon shoots Kirill a hard look: he's talking too much

     Kirill hesitates. He is angry as hell but too scared of
     his father's gaze to say anything. Finally he turns fast
     and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he
     goes.

</b>
     The cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates
     of wine. Flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. As
     Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill
     singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case
     of brandy across the cellar floor.

     Kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a
     long swig as Nikolai joins him. He grins as he gestures
     at the brandy...

     like a stab in the back. Finally Kirill swallows a huge
     swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug Nikolai. He
     squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away.

     Sweet Russian choral music covers the next four scenes.

     The street outside the restaurant is now flooding with
     rain. A Daimler and a Bentley are already parked. A large
     SUV pulls up and a hard-looking Russian man in his sixties
     (VALERY) is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits
     and shades.

     He is greeted by a darker-looking man in his fifties (THE
     GYPSY) who has a fur coat around his shoulders. Semyon is
     waiting on the doorstep, dressed in a fine dark suit.

     The curtains are drawn against the rainy light. The Gypsy,
     Valery, Semyon and TWO OTHER RUSSIAN MEN are sitting in a
     line behind a restaurant table, like a judging panel.

     After a moment Nikolai enters, dressed in suit and tie for
     the biggest interview of his life.

     The vory behind the table greet him.

     Then Nikolai takes off his jacket and removes his tie. He
     then takes off his shirt, to reveal that his upper body is
     decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow).

     He carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits
     down. The panel of the vory study his body, the Gypsy
     pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the
     detail of the tattoos. Only after the men have studied
     the tattoos does the interview begin.

     Nikolai is sitting in a banquette at the back, wearing
     only his underpants. We circle Nikolai as the tattooist
     begins to work on his knees, preparing Nikolai's knee caps
     for the tattoos.

     The needle bites at Nikolai's skin as the old tattooist
     wipes away the blood.

     Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above

     enter the changing room. They swagger up to Ozim.

     steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he
     can't see who has entered.

     He sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately.
     Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a
     head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if
     this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an
     instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with
     an open razor.

     Nikolai is naked, alone.

     Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a
     martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother.
     In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and
     fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one
     brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously
     has serious combat training but the brothers are strong
     and angry.

     Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor
     and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men
     are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water.
     Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the
     men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final
     surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a
     blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the
     temple.

     As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the
     bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes
     their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor,
     and staggers out of the steam room.

     examining his healing wounds. Then through the glass of

     recognizes him.

     The nurse points Yuri in Nikolai's direction.

     wearing Yuri's overcoat loosely over his hospital gown.
     Yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence
     for a moment.

     Anna flies out of Nikolai's room and spots a nurse.

</b>
     Anna runs fast down the corridor towards the hospital exit.
     She spots Nikolai ahead of her.

     She pushes past a couple of drunks and flies at him.

     Nikolai reacts.

</b>               You bastards!! Where will he take

     People back away as Nikolai grabs Anna's arms and holds
     her still.

<b>                           NIKOLAI
</b>               What are you talking about?!

     Anna studies Nikolai's face and sees his genuine confusion.
     She calms down a little.

</b>               Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine.

               coming to see you, but he wasn't,
               was he?

     Nikolai curses under his breath and thinks fast.

</b>
       The same dockside where Nikolai dumped Soyka and recommended
       this as the best place to dispose of a body. Kirill pulls
       up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes. The car is parked for a
       long time before finally the headlights are switched off.

       Anna and Nikolai leap aboard the bike and it starts first
       time. With Nikolai riding pillion, they roar away.

</b>
       On the edge of the dockside, Kirill is kneeling with the
       zip-up bag before him. Suddenly fireworks begin to burst
       over the Thames. It is the stroke of midnight.

       Kirill unzips the bag. When he looks inside Christine
       stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears.

<b>                             KIRILL
</b>                 She's a little girl, Papa, a little

       Kirill sobs then Christine cries...

<b>                             KIRILL (CONT'D)
</b>                 Shush, shush...

       Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to
       him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline. He
       looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused.
       He whispers...

      For a moment we believe he is going to throw her into the
      water. Instead he begins to sing a lullaby to her and her
      crying stops.

      Then we see a single light behind him. In a firework flash
      we see Nikolai and Anna climbing off the bike. They
      approach cautiously. Kirill stares at the man he loves.
      A pause. Christine begins to cry.

<b>                             ANNA
</b>                 Kirill, let me take the baby.

<b>                             ANNA
</b>                 She's cold, Kirill.

      Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks
      explodes. Nikolai doesn't move. Kirill is dangerously
      close to the edge of the dock. Maybe he'll throw himself
      in too.

<b>                             NIKOLAI
</b>                 Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little

      Kirill is motionless.

</b>                 Something like this would be bad

      A pause.

                 It's our turn now.

      Nikolai steps forward slowly.    As he gets closer Kirill
      hugs the baby.

      Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him. As he does
      he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are
      locked in a long embrace.

      Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his
      arms. He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close.
      Kirill turns to Nikolai.

<b>                             KIRILL

                   home.

      A pause. Kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car.
      Nikolai looks at Anna, who is hugging the baby. He waits
      a long time before realizing he must leave her.

      Nikolai can't answer truthfully, though he longs to do so.
      There is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable
      lie.

      A pause.   He laughs.

      Anna studies him, unsure. More New Year fireworks explode
      over the river. Kirill yells from the car...

                 come and fetch us.

      Nikolai nods, not liking the information but hiding it.
      Nikolai comes close and gently uncovers Christine's face.
      He smiles. Kirill is hooting the car horn.

      After a moment Nikolai and Anna kiss each other gently
      before Nikolai heads for the car.

      A summer's day. Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing
      to eat Sunday lunch. Stepan is carving. The conversation
      is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the
      table.

      Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and
      lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to
      Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana
      in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.

      Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to
      peer outside, staring across the park.

      Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka,
      staring back across the park. He peers out at ordinary
      life going on in the streets outside. Tatiana's V.O.
