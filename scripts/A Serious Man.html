<b>          
</b>          White letters on a black screen:
          Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you.

<b>          -RASHI
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          AGAINST BLACK: SNOWFLAKES
</b>
<b>          
</b>          The flakes drift lazily down toward us. Our angle looks straight
          up.
          Now an angle looking steeply down: the snow falls not quite dead
          away to collect on a
          foreground chimneypot and on the little shtetl street that lies
          maplike below us.
          It is night, and quiet, and the street is deserted except for
          one man who walks away from
          us, his valenki squeaking in the fresh snow. He carries bundled
          branches on one shoulder
          and has a hatchet tucked into his belt.

<b>          
</b>          We cut down to street level. The man walks toward us, bearded,
          and bundled against the
          cold. Smiling, he mutters in Yiddish-the dialogue subtitled.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          What a marvel... what a marvel...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          HOUSE INTERIOR
</b>          As its door opens and the man enters.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          Dora!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          VOICE
</b>          Yes...

<b>          
</b>          The man crosses to the stove with his bundle of wood. The voice
          continues:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          2
</b>          . Can you help me with the ice?
          The man dumps the wood into a box by the stove as his wife enters
          with an ice pick.
          . I expected you hours ago.

<b>          MAN
</b>          You can't imagine what just happened. I was coming back
          on the Lublin road when the wheel came off the cart
          thank heavens it was the way back and I'd already sold the
          geese!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          How much?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          Fifteen groshen, but that's not the story. I was struggling to
          set the cart upright when a droshky approaches from the
          direction of Lvov. How lucky, you think, that someone is
          out this late.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          Yes, very remarkable.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          But that's the least of it! He stops to help me; we talk of
          this, we talk of that-it turns out this is someone you know!
          Traitle Groshkover!

<b>          
</b>          His wife stares at him as he beams.
          He takes the stare as a sign that she can't place the name.
          . You know, REB GROSHKOVER! Pesel Bunim's uncle!
          The chacham from Lodz, who studied under the Zohar reb
          in Krakow!

<b>          
</b>          Still she stares. Then, quietly:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          God has cursed us.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          What?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          Traitle Groshkover has been dead for three years.

<b>          
</b>          Laughter erupts from the man but, as his wife continues to stare
          at him, he strangles on it.
          Quiet.
          Wind whistles under the eaves.

<b>          
</b>          The man says quietly:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          Why do you say such a thing! I saw the man! I talked to him!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          You talked to a dybbuk. Traitle Groshkover died of typhus
          in Pesel Bunim's house. Pesel told me-she sat shiva for
          him.

<b>          
</b>          They stare at each through a silence broken only by the sound
          of the quickening wind.
          A rap at the door.
          Neither immediately responds.
          Finally, to her husband:

<b>          
</b>          Who is it?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          For some soup, to warm himself.
          The wind moans. He helped me, Dora!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          THE DOOR
</b>          We are looking in from the outside as it unlatches and creaks
          in, opened by the husband
          in the foreground, who has arranged his face into a strained
          look of greeting. In the
          background the wife stares, hollow-eyed.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          REB GROSHKOVER! You are welcome here!
          Reverse on REB GROSHKOVER: a short, merry-looking fellow with
          a bifurcated beard and a
          silk hat and spectacles. He gives a little squeal of delight.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          You are too kind, Velvel! Too kind!

<b>          
</b>          He steps into the house and sees the wife staring at him.
          And you must be Dora! So much I have heard of you!
          Yes, your cheeks are pink and your legs are stout! What a
          wife you have!

<b>          
</b>          The husband chuckles nervously.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          Yes! A ray of sun, a ray of sun! Sit!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          My husband said he offered you soup.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          Yes, but I couldn't possibly eat this late, or I'd have
          nightmares. No, no: no soup for me!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          I knew it.

<b>          
</b>          REB GROSHKOVER laughs.

<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          I see! You think I'm fat enough already!

<b>          
</b>          He settles, chuckling, into his chair, but Dora remains sober:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          No. A dybbuk doesn't eat.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          5
</b>          REB GROSHKOVER stares at her, shocked.
          The wife returns the stare.
          The husband looks from wife to REB GROSHKOVER, apprehensive.
          A heavy silence.
          REB GROSHKOVER bursts into pealing laughter.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          What a wife you have!

<b>          
</b>          He wipes away tears of merriment; the husband relaxes, even begins
          to smile.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          I assure you, REB GROSHKOVER, it's nothing personal; she
          heard a story you had died, three years ago, at Pesel
          Bunim's house. This is why she think you are a dybbuk; I,
          of course, do not believe in such things. I am a rational
          man.

<b>          
</b>          REB GROSHKOVER is still chuckling.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          Oh my. Oh my yes. What nonsense. And even if there
          were spirits, certainly...
          He thumps his chest.
          I am not one of them!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          Pesel always worried. Your corpse was left unattended for
          many minutes when Pesel's father broke shiva and left the
          room-it must have been then that the Evil One-
          She breaks off to spit at the mention of the Evil One.
          -took you!

<b>          
</b>          REB GROSHKOVER is terribly amused:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          6
</b>
<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          "My corpse!" Honestly! What a wife you have!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          Oh yes? Look, husband...

<b>          
</b>          She steps forward to the Reb, who looks enquiringly up at her.
          They were preparing the body. Pesel's father shaved
          one check...

<b>          
</b>          As his eyes roll down to look at her hand, she draws it across
          his smooth right cheek.
          Then he left the room. He came back, and shaved the
          other...

<b>          
</b>          She reaches across to the other cheek, REB GROSHKOVER's eyes
          following her hand-
          You were already gone!

<b>          
</b>          -and drags her hand across. A bristly sound.

<b>          
</b>          REB GROSHKOVER laughs.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          I shaved hastily this morning and missed a bit-by you this
          makes me a dybbuk?

<b>          
</b>          He appeals to the husband:
          It's true, I was sick with typhus when I stayed with
          Peselle, but I recovered, as you can plainly see, and now
          I-hugh!

<b>          
</b>          The wife steps back.
          REB GROSHKOVER looks slowly down at his own chest in which the
          wife has just planted an
          ice pick.
          REB GROSHKOVER stares at the ice pick.
          The wife stares.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          7
</b>          The husband stares.
          Suddenly, REB GROSHKOVER bursts out laughing:
          What a wife you have!
          The husband can manage only a shocked whisper:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          Woman, what have you done?

<b>          
</b>          REB GROSHKOVER again looks down at his chest, which again moves
          him to laughter. He
          shakes his head.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          Why would she do such a thing?

<b>          
</b>          He looks up.
          I ask you, Velvel, as a rational man: which of us is
          possessed?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          What do you say now about spirits? He is unharmed!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          On the contrary! I don't feel at all well.

<b>          
</b>          And indeed, blood has begun to soak through his vest.
          He chuckles with less energy.
          One does a mitzvah and this is the thanks one gets?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          Dora! Woe, woe! How can such a thing be!

<b>          
</b>
<b>          REB GROSHKOVER
</b>          Perhaps I will have some soup. I am feeling weak...

<b>          
</b>          He rises to his feet but totters.
          Or perhaps I should go...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          8
</b>          He smiles weakly at Dora..
          One knows when one isn't wanted.
          He walks unsteadily to the door, opens it with some effort, and
          staggers out into the
          moaning wind and snow to be swallowed by the night.
          The wife and husband stare at the door banging in the wind.

<b>          FINALLY:
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          MAN
</b>          Dear wife. We are ruined. Tomorrow they will discover
          the body. All is lost.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          WIFE
</b>          Nonsense, Velvel...
          She walks to the door...
          Blessed is the Lord. Good riddance to evil and shuts it against
          the wind.

<b>          BLACK
</b>          A drumbeat thumps in the black.
          Music blares: the Jefferson Airplane. Grace Slick's voice enters:
          When the truth is found to be lies
          And all the hope inside you dies
          Don't you want somebody to love. . .

<b>          
</b>          An image fades in slowly, but even up full it is dim: some kind
          of round, dull white shape
          with a small black pinhole center. This white half-globe is a
          plug set in a flesh-toned
          field. The flesh tone glows translucently, backlit. We are drifting
          toward the white plug
          and, as we do so, the music grows louder still.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          AN EARPIECE
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          9
</b>          A pull back-a reverse on the preceding push in-from the cheap
          white plastic earpiece
          of a transistor radio. The Jefferson Airplane continues over
          the cut but becomes
          extremely compressed. The pull back reveals that the earpiece
          is lodged in someone's
          ear and trails a white cord.

<b>          
</b>          We drift down the cord to find the radio at its other end. As
          we do so we hear, live in the
          room, many voices speaking a foreign language in unison. A classroom,
          apparently.
          The radio is on a desktop but hidden from in front by the book
          held open before it. The
          book is written in non-Roman characters.
          We are in Hebrew school.

<b>          
</b>          The boy who is listening to the transistor radio-DANNY Gopnik-sits
          at a hinge-topped
          desk in a cinderblock classroom whose rows of desks are occupied
          by other boys and
          girls of about twelve years of age. It is dusk and the room is
          flourescent-lit.
          At the front of the room a gray-haired man in a worn suit and
          tie addresses the class.
          DANNY straightens one leg so that he may dig into a pocket. With
          an eye on the TEACHER to
          make sure he isn't being watched, he eases something out:
          A twenty-dollar bill.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          A BLINDING LIGHT
</b>          At the cut to the light the Jefferson Airplane music jumps up
          full. The light resolves into
          a multi-flared image of a blinking eye.
          Reverse: the inside of a human ear. Fleshy whorls finely veined,
          a cavity receding to
          dark.
          Objective on the DOCTOR's office: the DOCTOR is peering through
          a lightscope into the ear of
          an early-middle-aged man, LARRY Gopnik.
          The Jefferson Airplane music continues.

<b>          HEBREW SCHOOL
</b>          Close on Hebrew characters being scribbled onto the blackboard
          as the TEACHER talks.
          The TEACHER, talking.
          A bored child, staring off.
          His point-of-view: a blacktopped parking lot with a few orange
          school busses, beyond it a
          marshy field, and distant suburban bungalows.
          Close on another child staring at something through drooping
          eyelids.
          His point-of-view: very close on the face of a classroom clock.
          We hear its electrical
          hum. Its red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very
          slowly.
          DANNY Gopnik hisses:

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Fagle!.. .
          The TEACHER drones on, writing on the blackboard. DANNY's eyes
          flit from the TEACHER to
          the student sitting kitty-corner in front of him-a husky youth
          with shaggy hair. He
          hasn't heard the prompt.
          . Fagle!
          The TEACHER turns from the blackboard and DANNY leans back, eyes
          front, folding the
          twenty up small behind his book.

<b>          TEACHER

          out of one side of his
          mouth.

          He interrupts himself briefly to make a couple of phlegm-hawking
          sounds. He resumes:
          . Hamrah oomoh meshiach oomshel zal?

<b>          DOCTOR'S OFFICE
</b>          The DOCTOR palpates LARRY's midriff, digging his fingers into
          the hairy, baggy flesh.
          DOCTOR's Voice
          Uh-huh. We'll do some routine X-rays.

<b>          HEBREW SCHOOL
</b>          A young girl holds a hank of her bangs in front of her face,
          separating out individual hairs
          to examine them for split ends.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          Ahnoo ahnoo mah? Mah? Talmidim? D'vorah?

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>          12
</b>
<b>          D'VORAH
</b>          Ahnee to yodayah.
          The TEACHER begins to pace the desk aisles, looking back and
          forth among the students.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          Mee yodayah?
          The bugger-seeker, having succesfully withdrawn a bugger, carefully
          drapes it over the
          sharp end of his pencil, to what end we cannot know.
          DANNY, apprehensively eyeing the TEACHER, slides the twenty into
          the transistor radio's
          cover-sleeve.

<b>          X-RAY CONE
</b>          A huge white rubberized cone, pointed directly at us.
          We hear a rush of static and the DOCTOR's voice filtered through
          a talk-back:
          DOCTOR's Voice
          Hold still.
          Wider: LARRY is in his shorts lying on his back on an examining
          table covered by a sheet
          of tissue paper. The X-ray cone is pointed at the middle of his
          body.
          There is a brief sci-fi-like machine hum. It clicks off.

<b>          HEBREW SCHOOL
</b>          The clock-watching student's head is making descending bobs toward
          his chest.

<b>          TEACHER
</b>          Nefsheh shelach hamilamid-eh?!
          The TEACHER's circuit of the classroom has taken him around behind
          DANNY. DANNY's
          book lies face-down on the desk, covering the radio, but the
          white cord snakes out from
          under it up to his ear.
          The TEACHER yanks at the cord.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          13
</b>          The cord pops out of its jack and the Jefferson Airplane blares
          tinnily from beneath the
          book of torah stories.
          The TEACHER lifts the book to expose the jangling radio.
          Outraged, the TEACHER projects above the music:
          . Mah zeh? ! Mah zeh? !
          Some of the students are singing along; a couple beat rhythm
          on their desks.
          . Shechet, talmidim! Anachnoo lo cam zeh b'bait sefer!
          Shechet bivakasha!
          Three other students join in a chorus:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          STUDENTS
</b>          Shechet! Shechet bivakasha!
          The nodding student's head droops ever lower.
          Other students join in the chant:

<b>          SHECHET! SHECHET! SHECHET BIVAKASHA!
</b>
<b>          
</b>          The nodding student's chin finally reaches, and settles on, his
          chest, and he gives a long
          snorfling inhale of sleep.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          DOCTOR'S OFFICE
</b>          LARRY, now fully clothed, is seated across from the DOCTOR.
          The DOCTOR is looking at his file. He absently taps a cigarette
          out of a pack and lights up.
          He nods as he smokes, looking at the file.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          DOCTOR
</b>          Well, I-sorry.
          He holds the pack toward LARRY.

</b>          Well, you're in good health. How're Judith and the kids?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Good. Everyone's good. You know.
          The DOCTOR takes a long suck.

<b>          DOCTOR
</b>          Good. Daniel must be-what? About to be bar mitzvah?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Two weeks.

<b>          TINTED PHOTO PORTRAIT
</b>          The portrait, old, in an ornate gilt frame, is of a middle-aged
          rabbi with a small neat
          mustache and round spectacles. He wears a tallis hood-style and
          a phylactery box is
          strapped to his forehead. A plaque set into the frame identifies
          the man as Rabbi Minda.
          Wider shows that the portrait hangs in the Hebrew school principal's
          office, a white
          cinderblock room. It is quiet. The only sound is a deep electrical
          hum.
          Just visible behind the principal's desk, upon which is a low
          stack of books and a name
          plate identifying the occupant as MAR TURCHIK, is the top of
          a man's head-an old
          man, with a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is not.
          DANNY, seated opposite, pushes up from his slouch to better see
          across the desk.
          We boom up to show more of the principal. He is short. He wears
          a white shirt and
          hoist-up pants that come to just below his armpits. He has thick
          eyeglasses. He fiddles
          with the transistor radio, muttering:

<b>          PRINCIPAL
</b>          Hmm... eh... nu?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          15
</b>          He experiments with different dials on the radio.
          DANNY nervously watches.

<b>          DANNY
</b>          You put the-
          The old man holds up one hand.

<b>          PRINCIPAL
</b>          In ivrit. (In Hebrew)

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Um...
          The old man looks down at the little earpiece pinched between
          two fingers. He examines
          it as a superstitious native might a Coca-Cola bottle.
          The source of the electrical hum: a wall clock whose red sweep-second
          hand crawls
          around the dial very, very slowly.
          The Reb continues to squint at the earpiece.
          DANNY sighs. He encourages:

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Yeah, you-
          The principal's tone is harder:

<b>          PRINCIPAL
</b>          In ivrit!
          This time his cold look holds until he is sure that the admonishment
          has registered.
          He looks back down at the earpiece.
          We hear the door open. The principal ignores it.
          An old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a saucer.
          She has thick
          eyeglasses. She wears thick flesh-colored support hose. She takes
          slow, short steps
          toward the desk. The principal is studying the radio.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          16
</b>
<b>          PRINCIPAL
</b>          Mneh...
          The old woman continues to take slow short steps toward him.
          The tableau looks like a
          performance-art piece.
          She reaches the desk and sets the teacup down. She summons a
          couple of phlegm-
          hawking rasps and turns to go.
          She takes slow short steps toward the door.
          The principal raises the earpiece experimentally toward his ear.
           Close on his hairy, wrinkled ear as his trembling fingers bring
          in the earpiece. The
          i f ngers push and wobble and tamp the earpiece into place, hesitate,
          and then do some
          more pushing and wobbling and tamping.
          The principal keeps DANNY fixed with a stare as his hand hesitantly
          drops from his ear,
          ready to reach back up should the earpiece loosen.
          .mneh...
          Satisfied that neither the student nor the earpiece are about
          to make any sudden moves, he
          looks down at the radio. He turns a dial.
          Faintly and tinnily from the earpiece we hear the compressed
          jangle of rock music. The
          rabbi stares blankly, listening.
          DANNY slumps, looking warily at the rabbi.
          The rabbi continues to stare down at the radio. The compressed
          rock music jangles on.
          The rabbi is expressionless, mouth slightly open, listening.
          Tableau: anxious student, earplugged spiritual leader.
          Muffled, from the outer office, the hawking of phlegm.

<b>          CLASSROOM
</b>          We are behind a man who writes equations on a chalkboard, shoulder

          part is exciting...
          Students follow along, bored.
          LARRY continues to write.
          . So, okay. So. So if that's that, then we can do this,
          right? Is that right? Isn't that right? And that's
          Schrodinger's paradox, right? Is the cat dead or is the cat
          not dead? Okay?

<b>          BLEGEN HALL
</b>          LARRY is entering the physics department office. The department's
          secretary wheels her
          castored chair away from her typing.

<b>          SECRETARY
</b>          Messages, Professor Gopnik.
          He takes the three phone messages.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Thank you, Natalie. Oh-CLIVE. Come in.
          A Korean graduate student who was been waiting on a straightbacked
          chair rises.

<b>          LARRY'S OFFICE
</b>          He is flipping through the messages. Absently:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          So, uh, what can I do for you?
          The messages:

<b>          CALLED.

          WHILE YOU WERE OUT CLIVE Park

<b>          CALLED.
</b>          REGARDING: "Unjust test results."
          He crumples the last one.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Uh, Dr. Gopnik, I believe the results of Physics Mid-Term
          were unjust.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Uh-huh, how so?

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          I received an unsatisfactory grade. In fact: F, the failing
          grade.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Uh, yes. You failed the mid-term. That's accurate.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Yes, but this is not just. I was unaware to be examined on
          the mathematics.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well-you can't do physics without mathematics, really,
          can you.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          If I receive failing grade I lose my scholarship, and feel
          shame. I understand the physics. I understand the dead cat.

<b>          LARRY
</b>
<b>          (SURPRISED)
</b>          You understand the dead cat?

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          19
</b>          CLIVE nods gravely.
          But... you... you can't really understand the physics
          without understanding the math. The math tells how it
          really works. That's the real thing; the stories I give you in
          class are just illustrative; they're like, fables, say, to help
          give you a picture. An imperfect model. I mean-even I
          don't understand the dead cat. The math is how it really
          works.
          CLIVE shakes his head, dubious.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Very difficult... very difficult...

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well, I... I'm sorry, but I... what do you propose?

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Passing grade.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          No no, I-

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Or perhaps I can take the mid-term again. Now I know it
          covers mathematics.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well, the other students wouldn't like that, would they. If
          one student gets to retake the test til he gets a grade he
          likes.
          CLIVE impassively considers this.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Secret test.
          LARRY wraps a hand wearily over his eyes.

<b>          LARRY

          bite the bullet on this thing, CLIVE, and-

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Very troubling.
          He rises.
          . very troubling...
          He goes to the door, shaking his head, as LARRY looks on in surprise.
          He leaves.
          LARRY stares at the open door. The secretary outside, her back
          to us, types on.
          LARRY. looks stupidly around his own office, shakes his head.
          He picks up the phone message from Sy Ableman-"Let's talk"-and
          dials. As he dials
          his other hand wanders over the papers on the desktop.
          There is a plain white envelope on the desk. LARRY picks it up
          as the phone rings through.
          A ring is clipped short and a warm basso-baritone rumbles through
          the line:
          Phone Voice
          Sy Ableman.

          LARRY reacts to the money.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          (into phone)
          What?! Oh! Sorry! I, uh-call back!
          He slams down the phone.

<b>          . CLIVE!
</b>          He rushes out the door, through the secretarial area, and into
          the hallway, and looks up
          toward the elevators.
          Empty.
          He looks at the stuffed envelope he still holds.
          He goes back to the departmental office. The secretary sits typing.
          She glances at him
          and, as she goes back to her typing:

<b>          BUS
</b>          We are raking the exterior of an orange school bus as it rattles
          along. Hebrew characters
          on the side identify it-to some, anyway.

<b>          INSIDE
</b>          We are locked down on DANNY as the bus rattles like an old crate,
          squeaking, grinding
          gears, belching exhaust. DANNY and the children around him vibrate
          and pitch about but,
          from their lack of reaction, seem used to it.
          They raise their voices to be heard over the engine noise and
          the various stress noises in
          the chassis and a transistor radio somewhere that plays Jefferson
          Airplane.

          Rabbi Turchik took his radio. Had money in it.
          Ronnie Nudell
          That fucker!

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Yeah. I think he said he was confiscating it.
          Ronnie Nudell
          He's a fucker! Where do you get your money?
          Mark Sallerson
          Mike Fagle's gonna kick his ass. Last week he pounded
          the crap out of Seth Seddlemeyer.

          Ronnie Nudell
          They're both f ickers!

<b>          BATHROOM DOOR
</b>          A hand enters to knock.
          Uncle Arthur's Voice
          Out in a minute!

<b>          SARAH
</b>          Are you still in there?!
          Uncle Arthur
          I, uh.. . Just a minute!

<b>          SARAH
</b>          I've gotta wash my hair! I'm going out tonight, to the hole!
          Uncle Arthur
          Okay!

<b>          OUTSIDE
</b>          LARRY pulls into the driveway and gets out of the car. The purr
          of a lawn mower. He
          looks.
          His point-of-view: Gar Brandt, the next-door neighbor, is mowing
          his lawn. He has a
          buzz cut and is wearing a white T-shirt.
          Another noise competes with the lawn mower: rattling, squeaking,
          gear-grinding. The
          orange school bus with Hebrew lettering pulls up across the street.
          Its door opens with a
          pneumatic hiss to discharge a passenger.

</b>
<b>          DINNER TABLE
</b>          LARRY sits in. His wife and two children are already seated.
          There is one empty place.
          LARRY projects:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur!
          A muffled voice:

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Yeah!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Dinner!

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Okay! Out in a minute!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          We should wait.

<b>          SARAH
</b>          Are you kidding!
          They start eating.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Mr. Brandt keeps mowing part of our lawn.

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Does that matter?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          What?

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Is it important?
          LARRY shrugs.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          It's just odd.

<b>          
</b>

</b>
<b>          JUDY
</b>          Any news on your tenure?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I think they'll give me tenure.

<b>          JUDY
</b>          You think.

<b>          LARRY
</b>
<b>          (EQUABLY)
</b>          Well, I don't know. These things aren't, you know.. .

<b>          JUDY
</b>          No, I don't know. Which is why I ask.

<b>          LARRY
</b>
<b>          WELL-
</b>
<b>          SARAH
</b>          Mom, how long is Uncle Arthur staying with us?

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Ask your father.

<b>          BACK YARD
</b>          Twilight.
          LARRY is stepping onto a hose as he unwheels it from the drum
          of a traveling sprinkler,
          laying out an are to cover the back yard. Intermittent thwacks
          from next door:
          Gar Brandt and his son, who also has a buzz cut and a white T-shirt,
          throw a baseball
          back and forth. Gar Brandt throws hard. The ball pops in the
          boy's mitt.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Ow.
          LARRY walks over to the boundary defined by the fresh mowing.
          He sights down it.
          Gar Brandt looks over his shoulder at LARRY, looking. Gar Brandt
          is expressionless. He

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          27
</b>          goes back to throwing.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Ow.

<b>          INSIDE
</b>          Evening. Lights on. LARRY sits at the kitchen table, a briefcase
          open on the chair next to
          him. Blue books-examination booklets-are spread on the table
          in front of him. He
          reads, occasionally making marginal scribbles, grading.
          From off, faint and dulled by intervening walls, rock music:
          somewhere in the house
          DANNY is listening to the Jefferson Airplane.
          The clink of teaspoon against china as LARRY stirs his tea. He
          looks up at a noise: JUDY
          enters.

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Honey.

<b>          LARRY
</b>
<b>          (ABSENT)
</b>          Honey.

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Did you talk to Sy?
          Still absent, without looking up:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Sy?-Sy Ableman!-That's right, he called, but I-

<b>          JUDY
</b>          You didn't talk to him.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          No, I-

<b>          JUDY
</b>          You know the problems you and I have been having.
          Sympathetic, but still absent:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          28
</b>
<b>          LARRY
</b>          Mm.

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Well, Sy and I have become very close.
          This brings LARRY's head up. He focuses on JUDY, puzzled. She
          elaborates:
          In.short: I think it's time to start talking about a divorce.
          LARRY stares at her. A long beat.
          At length, trying to digest:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . Sy Ableman!

<b>          JUDY
</b>          This is not about Sy.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          You mentioned Sy!

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Don't twist my words. We-

<b>          LARRY
</b>          A divorce-what have I done! I haven't done anything-
          What have I done!

<b>          JUDY
</b>          LARRY, don't be a child. You haven't "done" anything. I
          haven't "done" anything.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Yes! Yes! We haven't done anything! And I-I'm
          probably about to get tenure!

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Nevertheless, there have been problems. As you know.

<b>          LARRY
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          29
</b>
<b>          WELL-
</b>
<b>          JUDY
</b>          And things have changed. And then-Sy Ableman. Sy has
          come into my life. And now-

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Come into your-what does that mean?! You, you, you,
          you barely know him!

<b>          JUDY
</b>          We've known the Ablemans for fifteen years.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Yes, but you you said we hadn't done anything!
          JUDY suddenly is stony:

<b>          JUDY
</b>          I haven't done anything. This is not some flashy fling.
          This is not about woopsy-doopsy.
          LARRY stares at her.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Sy Ableman!
          From down the hall, a knock on a door. A muffled voice:

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Out in a minute!

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Look, I didn't know any other way of breaking it to you.
          Except to tell you. And treat you like an adult. Is that so
          wrong?
          LARRY does not seem to be listening. His eyes roam the room as
          he thinks.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Where do I sleep?
          JUDY narrows her eyes.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          30
</b>
<b>          JUDY
</b>          What?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur's on the couch!

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Look. Sy feels that we should-

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Esther is barely cold!

<b>          JUDY
</b>          Esther died three years ago. And it was a loveless
          marriage. Sy wants a Gett.
          This derails the conversation. LARRY stares, trying to pick up
          the thread.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . A what?

<b>          JUDY
</b>          A ritual divorce. He says it's very important. Without a
          Gett I'm an Aguna.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          A what? What are you talking about?
          She turns to go, shaking her head, peeved:

<b>          JUDY
</b>          You always act so surprised.
          As she leaves:
          I have begged you to see the Rabbi.

<b>          FADE IN
</b>          LARRY has fallen asleep at the kitchen table, face-down in a
          pile of blue books. Cold blue
          light sweeps across him and he looks up.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          31
</b>          A short, balding middle-aged man in flannel pyjamas and an old
          flannel dressing gown
          stands in front of the open refrigerator holding an open jar
          of orange juice. He tips the jar
          back to drink, his free hand holding a balled-up towel to the
          back of his neck
          LARRY stares at him.

<b>          FADE OUT
</b>
<b>          BLEGEN HALL
</b>          LARRY enters the departmental office. His eyes are red-rimmed
          and dark-bagged. He has
          beard stubble.
          The department's secretary wheels her castored chair away from
          her typing.

<b>          SECRETARY
</b>          Messages, Professor Gopnik.
          He takes the two phone messages.

<b>          HIS OFFICE
</b>          LARRY looks at the messages:
          WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton
          OF Columbia Record Club

<b>          CALLED.
</b>          REGARDING: "2°d attempt. Please call."
          WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman

<b>          CALLED.
</b>          REGARDING "Let's have a good talk."
          A knock brings his look up.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Yes-thanks for coming, CLIVE.
          CLIVE Park enters the office.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          32
</b>          . Have a seat.
          LARRY uses a key to open the top left desk drawer. He takes out
          the envelope.
          We had, I think, a good talk, the other day, but you left
          something that-

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          I didn't leave it.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well--you don't even know what I was going to say.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          I didn't leave anything. I'm not missing anything. I know
          where everything is.
          LARRY looks at him, trying to formulate a thought.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well... then, CLIVE, where did this come from?
          He waves the envelope.
          . This is here, isn't it?
          CLIVE looks at it gravely.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Yes, sir. That is there.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          This is not nothing, this is something.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Yes sir. That is something.
          A beat.
          . What is it.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          You know what it is! You know what it is! I believe. And

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          33
</b>          you know I can't keep it, CLIVE.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Of course, sir.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I'll have to pass it on to Professor Finkle, along with my
          suspicions about where it came from. Actions have
          consequences.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Yes. Often.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Always! Actions always have consequences!
          He pounds the desk for emphasis.
          In this office, actions have consequences!

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Yes sir.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Not just physics. Morally.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Yes.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          And we both know about your actions.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          No sir. I know about my actions.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I can interpret, CLIVE. I know what you meant me to
          understand.

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          Meer sir my sir.
          LARRY cocks his head.

<b>          
</b>

</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          34

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . Meer sir my sir?

<b>          CLIVE
</b>          (careful enunciation)
          Mere... surmise. Sir.
          He gravely shakes his head.
          . Very uncertain.

<b>          CLOSE ON A TONE ARM
</b>          A hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record.
          Through scratches and pops, a solo tenor starts a mournful Hebrew
          chant.
          Close on the sleeve:
          Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion

<b>          VOLUME 12
</b>          Rabbi Youssele wears a caftan and a felt hat and has sad eyes.
          They peer out from the
          dark beard that covers most of the rest of his face like owl's
          eyes peering out of the
          woods.
          Wider, on DANNY, in his bedroom, evening. He lifts the tone arm
          on the portable
          turntable.
          He chants the passage.
          He drops the tone arm at the same place; Rabbi Youssele chants
          the passage again.
          DANNY listens, eyes narrowed. He lifts the tone arm and chants
          the passage again.
          He replays the passage again; before he can lift the tone arm
          to echo it his door bursts
          open. Rabbi Youssele continues to chant.

<b>          SARAH
</b>          All right, you know what I'm gonna do? You little brat? If

          We hear the thunk of the front door opening. DANNY stands, calling:

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Dad?

<b>          FOYER
</b>          LARRY is entering with his briefcase. As he stows it in the foyer
          closet DANNY's voice
          continues, off:

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Dad, you gotta fix the aerial.
          Judith emerges from the kitchen.

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Hello LARRY, have you thought about a lawyer?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Honey, please!
          DANNY emerges from the hall.

</b>          I can't get F Troop.

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          LARRY, the children know. Do you think this is some secret?
          Do you think this is something we're going to keep quiet?
          SARAH enters.

<b>          SARAH
</b>          Dad, Uncle Arthur is in the bathroom again! And I=m
          going to the hole at eight!
          She hits DANNY on the back of the head.

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Stop it!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          SARAH! What's going on!

<b>          DANNY
</b>          She keeps doing that!

<b>          LATER
</b>          LARRY sits in a reclining chair in the living room, head back,
          listening to Sidor Belarsky on
          the hi-fi. On top of the music is a hissing-sucking sound. There
          is also the sound of a
          pencil busily scratching paper.
          We cut to its source: Uncle Arthur sits scribbling into a spiral
          notebook, his free hand
          holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the back
          of his neck. The tube leads
          to a water-pik-like appliance on an end table next to him-the
          source of the sucking
          sound.
          After a long beat of listening to the music, LARRY speaks into
          space:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur?
          Uncle Arthur does not look up from his scribbling.
          Uncle Arthur
          Yes.
          LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          What're you doing?
          Still without looking up:
          Uncle Arthur
          Working on the Mentaculus.
          Long beat. Music. Scribbling.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Any luck, um, looking for an apartment?
          More scribbling.
          Uncle Arthur
          No.
          The doorbell chimes.

<b>          FRONT DOOR
</b>          LARRY enters, glances through the front door's head-height window,
          and-freezes, one
          hand arrested on the way to the doorknob.
          His point-of-view: framed by the window, yellowly lit by the
          stoop light, a human head.
          A middle-aged man, a few years older than LARRY. A fleshy face
          with droopy hangdog
          features, a five-o'clock shadow, and sad Harold Bloom eyes.
          LARRY opens the door.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Sy.
          Sy, entering, thrusts out a hand. His voice vibrates with a warm,
          sad empathy:

<b>          SY
</b>          Good to see you, LARRY.
          He is a heavy-set man wearing a short-sleeved shirt that his
          belly tents out in front of
          him. In his left hand he holds a bottle of wine.

<b>          LARRY
</b>
<b>          (TIGHTLY)
</b>          I'll get Judith.

<b>          SY
</b>          No, actually LARRY, I'm here to see you, if I might.
          He shakes his head.
          . Such a thing. Such a thing.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Shall we go in the...
          He is leading him into the kitchen but Sy, oblivious to surroundings,
          plows on with the
          conversation, arresting both men in the narrow space between
          kitchen sink and stove, and
          invading LARRY's space.

<b>          SY
</b>          You know, LARRY-how we handle ourselves, in this
          situation-it's so impawtant.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Uh-huh.

<b>          SY
</b>          Absolutely. Judith told me that she broke the news to you.
          She said you were very adult.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Did she.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>

</b>
<b>          SY
</b>          Absolutely. The respect she has for you.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Yes?

<b>          SY
</b>          Absolutely. But the children, LARRY. The children.
          He shakes his head.
          . The most impawtant.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well, I guess...

<b>          SY
</b>          Of coss. And Judith says they're handling it so well. A
          tribute to you. Do you drink wine? Because this is an
          incredible bottle. This is not Mogen David. This is a wine,
          LARRY. A bawdeaux.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          You know, Sy-

<b>          SY
</b>          Open it-let it breathe. Ten minutes. Letting it breathe, so
          impawtant.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Thanks, Sy, but I'm not-

<b>          SY
</b>          I insist! No reason for discumfit. I'll be uncumftable if
          you don't take it. These are signs and tokens, LARRY.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I'm just-I'm not ungrateful, I'm, I just don't know a lot
          about wine and, given our respective, you know-
          He is startled when Sy abruptly hugs him.

<b>          SY
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          40
</b>          S' okay.
          He finishes the hug off with a couple of thumps on the back.
          S'okay. Wuhgonnabe fine.

<b>          SKEWED ANGLE ON PARKING LOT
</b>          We are dutch on a slit of a view through a cracked-open frosted
          window: the Hebrew
          school parking lot.
          The last couple of busses filled with students are rolling out
          of the lot. It is late
          afternoon.
          A reverse shows DANNY in a stall, standing on a closed toilet,
          angling his head to peer out
          the bathroom window opened at the top.
          The bathroom outside the stall: Ronnie Nudell leans against a
          sink waiting, sucking a
          long draw from a joint.
          DANNY emerges from the stall. Ronnie Nudell offers the joint.
          Ronnie Nudell
          Want some of this fucker?

<b>          HALLWAY
</b>          The bathroom door cracks open in the foreground. DANNY peeks
          out.
          His point-of-view: the empty hallway ending in a T with another
          hallway. A janitor
          crosses, pushing a broom down the far hallway. He disappears.
          His echoing footsteps
          recede.
          DANNY and Ronny emerge from the bathroom.

<b>          RABBI MINDA
</b>          The photo-portrait on the wall of Mar Turchik's office lit by
          late-day sun.
          We hear a scraping sound.

</b>
<b>

<b>          41
</b>          Wider: Ronnie Nudell looks over DANNY's shoulder as DANNY, hunched
          at Mar Turchik's
          desk, fishes the end of a bent hanger into the keyhole on the
          top left drawer. After a beat,
          the hanger turns.
          They open the drawer. In it: squirt guns, marbles set to rolling
          by the opening of the
          drawer, a comic book, a Playboy magazine, a slingshot, a small
          bundle of firecrackers.
          Hands rifle the gewgaws: no radio.
          Ronnie Nudell
          Fuck.

<b>          SANCTUARY
</b>          We are behind the two boys who sit side by side on the last pew,
          staring at the front of
          the empty sanctuary. Its stained glass windows further weaken
          the late-afternoon light.
          In deference to the location, the boys wear yarmulkas.
          A long hold on their still backs.
          At length, some movement in DANNY's back, his head dips, and
          we hear him sucking on
          the joint. He holds it, exhales, and passes it wordlessly to
          Ronnie Nudell.

<b>          SUBURBAN STREET
</b>          We are pulling DANNY as he walks along the street, eyes red-rimmed,
          still wearing his
          yarmulka. It is dusk.
          After a few beats of walking, the front door of a house just
          behind DANNY opens. A
          husky, shaggy-haired youth emerges on the run.
          The sound has alerted DANNY. Seeing Mike Fagle, he too begins
          to run. He reaches up
          and grabs his yarmulka and clutches it in one of his pumping
          fists.
          Pursued and pursuer both run wordlessly, panting, feet pounding.
          Mike Fagle is closing. But DANNY is already cutting across the
          Brandt's front yard,
          approaching his own. He plunges into the house and slams the
          door.
          Mike Fagle draws up, panting, gazing hungrily at the house.

</b>          Lights are on inside. The house is a warm yellow citadel in the
          dusk.
          After a beat we hear, faint and dulled, the Jefferson Airplane.
          Mike Fagle slinks away.

<b>          PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS
</b>          A shockingly blue sky with picture-perfect clouds hanging in
          it.
          After a beat the top of an aluminum extension ladder swings in
          from the bottom of the
          frame and comes toward us.
          We cut to a side angle as the ladder clunk against a roof.
          It starts vibrating to the rhythmic clung of someone climbing.
          Hands enter. LARRY's head enters.
          He climbs onto the roof.
          He takes a couple steps away from the edge and stands tentatively,
          making sure of his
          balance. He looks around.
          His point-of-view towards the front. An unfamiliarly high perspective
          on the street and
          the neighboring houses, almost maplike. Very peaceful. Wind rhythmically,
          gently
          waves the trees.
          LARRY gingerly walks up to the aerial at the peak of the roof.
          We are hearing a rhythmic
          popping noise.
          LARRY reaches the peak and straddles it. He looks down at the
          back yard.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Ow.
          Foreshortened Gar Brandt and Mitch are playing catch in their
          back yard. With each toss
          the ball pops, alternately in father's mitt and son's.
          Precariously balanced, LARRY reaches out for the aerial. He tentatively
          touches it. He
          grasps it. He twists the aerial.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          43
</b>          Something strange: as it rotates the aerial creaks-a high whine
          as pure as the hum
          sounded from the rim of a wineglass.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Ow.
          Faintly, under the wineglass sound, and clouded by static, a
          high, ringing tenor sings in
          an unfamiliar modality. Cantorial music.
          LARRY drops his hand. Inertia keeps the aerial rotating slowly
          til it dies, the sound drifting
          away into the sybillant shushing of trees.
          LARRY reaches out again to turn the aerial. The same crystal
          hum... cantorial singing...
          and now, layering in, the theme from F Troop.
          Music. Crystal hum. Wind.

<b>          MITCH
</b>          Ow.
          LARRY's look travels: his point-of-view pans slowly off the steep
          angle of father and son
          playing catch, travels across his own backyard, and brings in
          the white fence that
          encloses the patio of the neighbor on the other side.
          Gar (off)
          Good toss, Mitch.
          On the enclosed patio a woman reclines on a lawn chaise of nylon
          bands woven over an
          aluminum frame. She is on her back, eyes closed against the sun.
          She is naked.
          Mitch (off)
          Ow.
          LARRY reacts to the naked woman: startled at first, he moves
          to hide behind the peak of the
          roof. But as he realizes that the sun keeps the woman's eyes
          closed he relaxes, continu-
          ing to stare.
          She is attractive. Not young, not old: LARRY's age. Peaceful.
          After a still beat one of her hands gropes blindly to the side.
          It finds an ashtray on the
          table next to her and takes from it a pluming cigarette. The
          woman takes a puff and
          replaces it.

          F Troop. Cantorial singing.
          Blue sky and white puffy clouds.
          The sound of a pencil scratching against paper.

<b>          NOTEBOOK
</b>          A pencil scratches equations into a lamplit spiral notebook.
          Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut. So does the spluttering suck-sound
          of Uncle Arthur's
          evacuator.
          Wider on Uncle Arthur, in his pyjamas, propped up on the narrow
          fold-out sofa, writing
          with one hand as he holds the evacuator hose to his neck with
          the other.
          Squeezed into the living room next to the fold-out sofa is a
          camp cot of plaid-patterned
          nylon stretched over an aluminum frame. On the camp cot is LARRY,
          lying half-in, half-
          out of a rumpled sleeping bag. He stares at the ceiling, a damp
          washcloth pressed against
          his forehead. His face is flaming red.
          Arthur speaks absently as he scribbles:

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Will you read this? Tell me what you think?
          LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Okay.
          Uncle Arthur glances up from the notebook, focuses on LARRY.

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Boy. You should've worn a hat.

          LARRY still stares at the ceiling. He shifts his weight. The
          aluminum frame of the cot
          squeaks. He shifts again. Another creak.
          LARRY fishes his watch from the jumble of clothes on the floor:
<b>          4:50.

<b>          KITCHEN
</b>          LARRY, in his underwear, spoons ground coffee into the percolator.
          Uncle Arthur snores
          softly on in the other room.
          From outside, a dull thunk.
          LARRY pulls back a curtain.
          Next door, Gar Brandt is going down the walk, wearing camouflage
          togs and camo billed
          cap, a rifle bag slung over his shoulder. He is carrying an ice
          chest, its contents clicking
          and sloshing.
          The boy Mitch, also wearing camo clothes and cap and also with
          a rifle bag, has just
          closed the front door. He now lets the screen door swing shut
          behind him and follows his
          father down the walk to the car in the driveway.
          The twitter of early morning birds. Gar's voice, though not projected,
          stands out in the
          pre-dawn quiet:

<b>          CLOSE ON THE NOTEBOOK

          After a beat LARRY's hand enters to turn the page. The second

</b>          This brings LARRY's look up from the Mentaculus. We are in LARRY's
          office. Standing in
          the office doorway is Arlen Finkle.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Hi Arlen.
          Arlen Finkle
          LARRY, I feel that, as head of the tenure committee I should
          tell you this, though it should be no cause for concern. You
          should not be at all worried.
          LARRY waits for more. Arlen seems to need a prompt.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Okay.
          Arlen Finkle
          I feel I should mention it even though we won't give this
          any weight at all in considering whether to grant you
          tenure, so, I repeat no cause for concern.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Okay, Arlen. Give what any weight?
          Arlen Finkle
          We have received some letters, uh... denigrating you, and,
          well, urging that we not grant you tenure.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          From who?
          Arlen Finkle
          They're anonymous. And so of course we dismiss them
          completely.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well... well... what do they say?
          Arlen Finkle
          They make allegations, not even allegations, assertions, but

          I'm not supposed to deal in any specifics about the
          committee's deliberations.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          But... I think you're saying, these won't play any part in
          your deliberations.
          Arlen Finkle
          None at all.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Um, so what are they...
          Arlen Finkle
          Moral turpitude. You could say.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Uh-huh. Can I ask, are they, are they-idiomatic?
          Arlen Finkle
          I, uh...

<b>          LARRY
</b>          The reason I ask, I have a Korean student, South Korean,
          disgruntled South Korean, and I meant to talk to you about
          this, actually, he-
          Arlen Finkle
          No. No, the letters are competently-even eloquently
          written. A native English-speaker. No question about
          that.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Uh-huh.
          Arlen Finkle
          But I reiterate this, LARRY: no cause for concern. I only

          Best to Judith.
          LARRY answers with a wan smile. He looks down at the Mentaculus.

<b>          HEBREW SCHOOL EXTERIOR
</b>          Day. Somewhere inside the school a bell rings. Its doors swing
          open and children
          emerge.
          Our angle is down a line of school busses, each with the the
          same stenciled Hebrew
          lettering, waiting to ferry the children home.
          We are tracking toward the busses to steepen the rake. As children
          sort themselves out
          and climb into their respective vehicles, the track brings the
          nearest bus into the fore-
          ground. It noisily idles with its signature squeaks and stress
          sounds, its low coughing
          engine ominously rumbling. Children start climbing on.

<b>          MINUTES LATER
</b>          Inside the bus, now moving. Engine noise bangs in louder and
          air roars in through open
          windows.
          We are on the driver, a sallow man in a short-sleeved white shirt
          with earlocks and a
          yarmulke. He pitches about, stoically wrestling with the wheel
          and gear shift as the
          vehicle bucks.
          The pitching children. Somewhere, Jefferson Airplane plays.

          Maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole.

<b>          DANNY
</b>          I gotta get it back. Or Mike Fagle's gonna pound the crap

<b>          DANNY
</b>          And I'll still have to get my sister the money back or she's
          gonna break four of my records. Twenty bucks, four
          records.
          Howard Altar
          How do you buy all those records. Where do you get your
          funds.

<b>          CLOSE ON LARRY
</b>          Standing in his yard. His eyes are darkly pouched. He is staring
          at something, it seems
          in distress. We hear a fluttering sound.
          His point-of-view: stakes are set out in the Brandts' yard. Red
          ribbon connecting them
          outlines a projection from the side of the house. The loose ends
          of the ribbon flutter in
          the breeze.
          Engine noise brings LARRY's look around. A car is arriving.
          It is the Brandts' car, oddly burdened. As it pulls into their
          driveway we see that there is
          a four-point stag strapped to the hood, its head lolling over
          the grille.
          Gar and Mitch get out of the car in their hunting fatigues. Blood
          is smeared on Gar's
          shirt.

<b>          GAR
</b>          Go scrub up, Mitch.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Uh, good afternoon.
          This brings Gar's look around. Apparently he is unused to talking
          with his neighbor.
          There is a short beat before his response.

<b>          GAR
</b>          Afternoon.
          In the background of his angle is the dead buck, staring off
          through sightless eyes.

</b>          Yep.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Is that a, uh...
          He is indicating the staked area. Gar looks around at it, looks
          back at LARRY.

<b>          GAR
</b>          Gonna be a den.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Uh-huh, that's great. Uh, Mr. Brandt-
          Gar barks at Mitch, who has lingered to listen to the grown-ups:

<b>          GAR
</b>          I said scrub up, Mitch!
          The child quickly goes. LARRY frowns.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Isn't this a school day?

<b>          GAR
</b>          Took him out of school today. So he could hunt with his
          dad.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Oh!
          He nods.
          . That's.. . nice.
          Gar stares at him with button eyes. Small talk is not his thing.
          LARRY clears his throat.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          51
</b>          . Um, Mr. Brandt, that's just about at the property line,
          there. I don't think we're supposed to get within, what, ten

<b>          FEET
</b>
<b>          GAR
</b>          Property line's the poplar.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . the. ?

<b>          GAR
</b>          Poplar!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . Well.. . even if it is, you're just about over it

<b>          GAR
</b>          Measure.
          We hear two pairs of pounding footsteps coming up the street.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I don't have to measure, you can tell it's...

<b>          GAR
</b>          Line's the poplar.
          He indicates.
          . It's all angles.
          Gar Brandt turns and goes.
          LARRY turns, reacting to the pounding footsteps. One of the two
          pairs belongs to DANNY
          who arrives, slowing to a walk, panting, a bookbag over his shoulder.
          A half-block back the pursuing boy also stops running. Husky,
          shaggy-haired, he
          watches, scowling, as DANNY goes up the walk to his house.
          LARRY addresses DANNY's retreating back:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          What's going on?

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Nothing.

<b>          IN THE HOUSE
</b>          As LARRY enters.
          Judith (ofj)

          No, I-not yet.

<b>          LARRY.

          The thud of a car door outside.
          SARAH heads for the front door, pulling on a jacket. LARRY is
          surprised.
          . Where are you going?

<b>          SARAH
</b>          I'm going to the hole.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          At five o'clock?
          He looks out the front-door window. Four girls of SARAH's age
          are coming up the walk

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>

</b>          from the car. All have dark hair and big noses.

<b>          SARAH
</b>          We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's house so I can wash
          my hair.
          LARRY pulls open the door just as the doorbell rings. From the
          four dark girls:

<b>          VOICES
</b>          Hi, Mr. Gopnik.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          You can't wash it here?
          From somewhere in the house, Jefferson Airplane starts.
          As she brushes past LARRY:

<b>          SARAH
</b>          Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.

<b>          VOICE
</b>          Out in a minute!
          Judith enters.

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Are you ready?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Huh?

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          We're meeting Sy at Embers.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I am?

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Both of us. I told you.

<b>          SY
</b>          LARRY. How are you.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Sy.

<b>          SY
</b>          Hello Judith.

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Hello Sy.
          Once Sy releases LARRY, all seat themselves at Sy's booth, Judith
          next to Sy, LARRY
          facing.

<b>          SY
</b>          Thank you for coming, LARRY. It's so impawtant that we be
          able to discuss these things.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I'm happy to come to Embers, Sy, but, I'm thinking, really,
          maybe it's best to leave these discussions to the lawyers.

<b>          SY
</b>          Of coss! Legal matters, let the lawyers discuss! Don't mix
          apples and oranges!

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          I've beamed you to see the lawyer.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          (teeth grit)
          I told you, I'm going Monday.

<b>          SY
</b>          Monday is timely! This isn't-please!-Embers isn't the
          forum for legalities, you are so right!

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Hmph.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          55
</b>
<b>          SY
</b>          No, Judith and I thought merely we should discuss the
          practicalities, the living arrangements, a situation that will
          conduce to the comfit of all the parties. This is an issue
          where no one is at odds.
          LARRY isn't sure where this is leading:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . Living arrangements.

<b>          SY
</b>          Absolutely. I think we all agree, the children not being
          contaminated by the tension-the most impawtant.

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          We shouldn't put the kids in the middle of this, LARRY.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          The kids aren't-

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          I'm saying "we." I'm not pointing fingers.

<b>          SY
</b>          No one is playing the "blame game," LARRY.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I didn't say anyone was!

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Well let's not play He said, She said, either.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I wasn't! I. ---

<b>          SY
</b>          Aw right, well let's just step back, and defuse the situation,

<b>          LARRY.
</b>          LARRY glares at Sy.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          56
</b>          Sy smiles at him, sadly. He reaches over and rests a hand on
          LARRY's hand.
          . I find, sometimes, if I count to ten.
          A beat.
          One... two... three... faw... Or silently.
          Long beat.

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Really, to keep things on an even keel, especially now,
          leading up to DANNY's bar mitzvah-

<b>          SY
</b>          A child's bar mitzvah, LARRY!

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Sy and I think it's best if you move out of the house.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . Move out?!

<b>          SY
</b>          It makes eminent sense.

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Things can't continue as they-

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Move out! Where would I go?!

<b>          SY
</b>          Well, for instance, the Jolly Roger is quite livable. Not
          expensive, and the rooms are eminently livable.

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          This would allow you to visit the kids.

<b>          SY
</b>          There's convenience in its fava. There's a pool-

<b>          LARRY

<b>

</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          57
</b>          Wouldn't it make more sense for you to move in with Sy?
          Judith and Sy gape at him, shocked.
          After a long beat:

<b>          JUDITH
</b>
<b>          LARRY!
</b>
<b>          SY
</b>          LARRY, you're jesting!

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          LARRY, there is much to accomplish before that can happen.
          Sy is sadly shaking his head.

<b>          SY
</b>          LARRY, LARRY, LARRY. I think, really, the Jolly Roger is the
          appropriate coss of action.
          He shrugs.
          It has a pool.

<b>          IN BLACK AND WHITE: A BRAIN
</b>          It sits in a large fishbowl filled with clear fluid.
          The brain, alive, pulses. Leads connect it to various pieces
          of gear outside the fishbowl.
          Brain and appurtenances sit on a dais of sorts dressed out with
          bunting.
          Oddly, the picture is scored with cantorial singing.
          The brain seems to be giving orders to people who wear imperfectly
          form-fitting 1950's
          uniforms of the future. After receiving their instructions the
          minions of the brain
          kowtow before it and leave. They are succeeded by two leather-helmeted
          thugs, big and
          heavy though lacking muscle definition, who escort a resisting
          handsome man before the
          brain. The handsome man, hands tied behind his back, gazes defiantly
          up at the brain
          which in some fashion addresses him.
          We hear blows and voices over the cantorial music:

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

</b>          Creep fucker!

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Stop it! I'm getting it! I'm gonna get it!
          Wider shows that the brain is on television, which DANNY has
          muted while he plays the
          Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt record and drills his torah portion.
          He and SARAH are in a
          stand-off, hands tensed to either deliver or ward off blows.

<b>          SARAH
</b>          Brat!
          LARRY enters.

</b>          What's going on?

<b>          SARAH
</b>
<b>          (LEAVING)

</b>          Nothing.

</b>          How's the haftorah coming? Can you maybe use the hi-fi?

<b>          DANNY
</b>          What?
          We hear the doorbell off. LARRY indicates the portable record
          player.

          the Jolly Rodger.

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Sure Dad.
          On TV, the handsome man shouts defiance at the brain.
          From off, SARAH projects:

<b>          SARAH
</b>          Dad. Chinese guy.

<b>          ASIAN MAN
</b>          A middle-aged Korean man, well groomed. He wears a nicely cut
          suit and a jeweled tie-
          pin.

<b>          MAN
</b>          Culcha clash.
          He bangs his two knuckles together, illustrating.
          . Culcha clash.
          He faces LARRY in the driveway. LARRY's car is half-loaded with
          open boxes that are
          haphazardly stuffed with clothing and effects.
          LARRY is leaning against the hood, arms folded, gazing at the
          man, unimpressed. A long
          beat.
          Finally he bestirs himself.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          With all respect, Mr. Park, I don't think it's that.
          Mr. Park
          Yes.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          No. It would be a culture clash if it were the custom in
          your land to bribe people for grades.
          Mr. Park
          Yes.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          So-you're saying it is the custom?
          Mr. Park
          No. This is defamation. Grounds for lawsuit.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          You-let me get this straight-you're threatening to sue
          me for defaming your son?
          Mr. Park
          Yes.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          But it would-
          Gar Brandt
          Is this man bothering you.
          Gar Brandt stands on the strip of lawn separating the two neighbors.
          He is giving Mr.
          Park a hard stare.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Is he bothering me? No. We're fine. Thank you, Mr.
          Brandt.
          Gar Brandt, not entirely convinced, withdraws, glaring at the
          Korean.
          LARRY turns back to Mr. Park.
          . I, uh. . See, if it were defamation there would have to
          be someone I was defaming him to, or I... All right, I...
          let's keep it simple. I could pretend the money never
          appeared. That's not defaming anyone.

</b>          Sidor Belarsky's singing crosses the cut. The tone arm of DANNY's
          portable record
          player rides on a spinning LP.
          Wider shows LARRY grading bluebooks at a small formica table
          crowded into a corner of
          his motel room. It is a depressingly generic budget motel room
          of the mid-sixties with
          cheaply paneled walls, thin carpet, formica night tables, plastic
          lamps, and twin beds
          with stained nubby bedspreads.
          The phone rings.

          . Fine, Mimi, how are you?... Uh-huh... No, it's not
          that bad... It's not that bad... There's a pool...
          Arthur emerges from an alcove in the dim depth of the room that
          has a dressing-room
          mirror and apparently connects to the bathroom. He has a hand
          towel pressed to the
          back of his neck.

<b>          LAKE NOKOMIS
</b>          The beach: families are crowded onto the small beach of a freshwater
          lake, children
          cavorting, adults lounging, much sun, few umbrellas. Red floats
          connected by red nylon
          rope define a swimming area; beyond it people dive from an anchored
          raft.
          Splashing and children's laughter slap off the surface of the
          lake.

<b>          WOODS
</b>          Above the lake. The beach noise has some distance. It also has
          a faintly bizarre canyon
          echo. There is a present, sybillant shushing of breeze in the
          trees.
          It is dark here with intense hot spots where sun sifts through
          the leaf cover. We are close
          on DANNY, who sits very still, leaning back against a tree trunk.

          feathering out with his
          breath.

</b>          Gimme that fucker.
          DANNY passes the joint to Ronnie Nudell, who sits opposite.

<b>          PICNIC AREA
</b>          On a woodless rise above the lake. Each of the separate picnic
          areas consist of a redwood
          table and benches placed next to a firepit.
          Here in the sun both LARRY and Mel Nudell, a man slightly older
          than LARRY, glisten with
          sweat. Mel, in the background, bounces a bag of charcoal briquettes
          to spill some into
          the firepit. LARRY sits at the table in the foreground with Mimi
          Nudell who alone seems
          unaffected by the heat-or by anything else in the physical environment.
          Her pale,
          gravely composed Giacometti face is shaded by a large-brimmed
          hat.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          No. Almost a year and a half since Touche Ross let him
          go. He's very good with numbers. I think his, his social
          skills have held him back.

<b>          MIMI
</b>          Such a sweet man though.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur has a good heart. And he never complains, unlike
          me. Sometimes I don't give him enough credit.

<b>          MIMI
</b>          He tried to tell me about this thing he's working on, this,
          um...

<b>          LARRY
</b>          The Mentaculus? He says it's a, uh. a probability map.
          Of the universe. He asked if I could help him publish it.
          Um, it was a little hard for me to evaluate.

<b>          MIMI
</b>          Does he go out socially at all?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          He tries. He's been going to the singles mixers at Hillel
          House.-Well, I should talk, I'm not doing any better.

<b>          MIMI
</b>          How is Judith?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Fine. She's fine. I'm the odd man out.
          Mimi smiles.

<b>          MIMI
</b>          Sometimes these things just aren't meant to be. And it can
          take a while before you feel what was always there, for
          better or worse.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I never felt it! It was a bolt from the blue! What does that
          mean! Everything that I thought was one way turns out to
          be another!

<b>          MIMI
</b>          Then-it's an opportunity to learn how things really are.
          LARRY broods. Mimi softens.
          . I'm sorry-I don't mean to sound glib. It's not always
          easy, deciphering what God is trying to tell you.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I'll say.

<b>          MIMI
</b>          But it's not something you have to figure out all by your-
          self. We're Jews, we have that well of tradition to draw on,
          to help us understand. When we're puzzled we have all the

          the same problems.

</b>          I guess.

          Arthur is climbing the hill from the lake, dripping wet. He projects:

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Boy! The air out here is magnificent!
          Mimi, looking at LARRY, responds to his dark silence:

<b>          MIMI
</b>          Why not see him?
          Mel Nudell has finished spreading and lighting the coals. He
          now comes and sits next to
          Mimi, draping an arm over her shoulder. She strokes his hand,
          still looking at LARRY.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          What's the rabbi gonna tell me?

<b>          MIMI
</b>          If I knew I'd be the rabbi.
          He looks at her glumly. She laughs.
          . Life is beautiful, LARRY. Nobody's sick. Nobody died.
          You just need help remembering how to enjoy it.
          She rests her head against Mel's shoulder.
          . Where are the kids?

</b>          Day. LARRY sits waiting. A door opens and he rises.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Oh-Rabbi Scott.
          Rabbi Scott Ginzler is the junior rabbi, a man in his twenties.
          Rabbi Scott
          Hello LARRY.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I thought I was going to see Rabbi Nachtner.
          Rabbi Scott
          He was called away on an etz monim: Ruth Brynn's mother
          is in the hospital and she isn't doing well. Rabbi Nachtner
          asked me to cover for him-come on in.

<b>          RABBI SCOTT'S OFFICE
</b>          A few minutes later. LARRY sits tensely hunched forward facing
          Rabbi Scott.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          And she wants a Gett.
          A long silence. The hum of ventilation.
          At length:

<b>

<b>

<b>          LARRY
</b>          She wants a-
          Rabbi Scott
          Oh, a Gett. Uh-huh, sure.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I feel like the carpet's been yanked out from under me. I
          don't know which end is up. I'm not even sure how to
          react; I'm too confused.
          Rabbi Scott
          What reasons did she give? For the rupture?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          She didn't give-reasons. Just that, oh, you know, things
          haven't been going well.
          Rabbi Scott
          And is that true?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I guess. I don't know. She's usually right about these
          things.
          Rabbi Scott
          Mm-hm.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I feel so... addled.
          Rabbi Scott
          Yes, I can see.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I was hoping that... Rabbi Nachtner...
          Rabbi Scott
          That he would... yes?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          68
</b>
<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well, with the benefit of his life experience... no

<b>          OFFENSE-
</b>          Rabbi Scott chuckles.
          Rabbi Scott
          No, of course not. I am the junior rabbi. And it's true, the
          point-of-view of somebody who's older and perhaps had
          similar problems might be more valid. And you should see
          the senior rabbi as well, by all means. Or even Minda if
          you can get in, he's quite busy. But maybe-can I share
          something with you? Because I too have had the feeling of
          losing track of Hashem, which is the problem here. I too
          have forgotten how to see Him in the world. And when
          that happens you think, well, if I can't see Him, He isn't
          there any more, He's gone. But that's not the case. You
          just need to remember how to see Him. Am I right?
          He rises and goes to the window.
          I mean, the parking lot here. Not much to see.
          It is a different angle on the same parking lot we saw from the
          Hebrew school window.
          But if you imagine yourself a visitor, somebody who
          isn't familiar with these... autos and such... somebody
          still with a capacity for wonder... Someone with a fresh...
          perspective. That's what it is, LARRY.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Um...
          Rabbi Scott
          Because with the right perspective you can see Hashem,
          you know, reaching into the world. He is in the world, not
          just in shul. It souunds to me like you're looking at the
          world, looking at your wife, through tired eyes. It sounds
          like she's become a sort of... thing... a problem... a
          thing...

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well, she's, she's seeing Sy Ableman.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          69
</b>          Rabbi Scott
          Oh.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          She's, they're planning, that's why they want the Gett.
          Rabbi Scott
          Oh. I'm sorry.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          It was his idea.
          Rabbi Scott
          Well, they do need a Gett to remarry in the faith. But this
          is life. For you too. You can't cut yourself off from the
          mystical or you'll be-you'll remain-completely lost.
          You have to see these things as expressions of God's will.
          You don't have to like it, of course.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          The boss isn't always right, but he's always the boss.
          Rabbi Scott
          Ha-ha-ha! That's right, things aren't so bad. Look at the
          parking lot, LARRY.
          Rabbi Scott gazes out, marveling.
          . Just look at that parking lot.

<b>          EXTERIOR: GOPNIK HOUSE
</b>          Our low angle looks across the lawn toward the front of the house.
          Someone's pounding
          footsteps approach and his feet enter just off the lens and he
          quickly recedes, cropping in
          as he races up to the house: DANNY.
          A beat later pursuing feet enter, slowing-for DANNY is already
          mounting the front
          stoop. DANNY's pursuer does not go deep enough to crop in but
          we might gather from
          the size eleven sneakers and the cuffed jeans that it is hulking
          Mike Fagle.

</b>          We hear the front door being flung open and slammed shut, and
          in the background foyer
          DANNY appears, panting heavily. He gives one glance back toward
          the front door and
          then looks at his mother and sister eating soup in the foreground.
          His sister has a towel
          wrapped turbanlike around her head. She holds it with one hand
          to keep it from tipping
          off when she tilts her head down for the soup.

<b>          DANNY
</b>          (still panting)
          We eating already?

<b>          SARAH
</b>          I'm going to the hole.
          DANNY enters the kitchen and sits at the setting across from
          his sister. He picks up his
          spoon.
          Some movement in SARAH's body; DANNY recoils from a kick.

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Ow! Cut it out!

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          What's going on?
          The siblings slurp soup, neither answering.
          After a couple slurps:
          . Isn't Dad eating?

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          He's at the Jolly Roger.

</b>          In a small windowless conference room lined by bookshelves filled
          with law reference
          books, LARRY rises to greet Don Milgram, entering.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Don.

<b>          DON
</b>          How are you, LARRY, Jesus, I am so sorry to be seeing you

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Oh, well...

<b>          DON
</b>          I always thought you and JUDY were rock solid. This is so
          terrible, LARRY. This is devastating.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well, the way I look at it, it's an opportunity for me to
          really sit down and figure things out, and, and, look at the
          world afresh instead of just, you know, settling for the
          routine, tired old way of looking at things.
          Don Milgram stares at him.

<b>          DON
</b>          . Really?

<b>          DON
</b>          Well, legally, I have to warn you, it's never easy for the
          husband. Unless, of course, there's some question of the
          wife having violated the marriage contract.

<b>          LARRY

<b>          DAWN AT THE JOLLY ROGER
</b>          Wide on the motel room, dimly lit by weak sun starting to seep
          in around the curtain.
          LARRY sleeps in one of the twin beds; Uncle Arthur snores in
          the other.
          Uncle Arthur's breath snags and tangles on a snorfling inhale
          and it wakes him, gagging.
          He blinks, sits up, swings his legs out, gazes blearily around
          the room.
          He rises stiffly and heads for the bathroom.
          LARRY stirs. The sound of Uncle Arthur urinating. LARRY looks
          blearily around.
          LARRY stiffly rises. He takes the two steps across the room to
          the formica desk on which
          are spread papers for his class. As we hear the sucking sound
          of the neck evacuator in
          the bathroom, LARRY sweeps papers together and mechanically stuffs
          his briefcase.

<b>          CAR
</b>          LARRY is driving, hollow-eyed, to work.
          After a long beat of staring, the ka-ching of a bicycle bell.

          and passes:
          The bicyclist. A young Asian man wearing a white traffic-mask.
          LARRY looks at him in the rear-view.

<b>          LARRY
</b>
<b>          CLIVE!
</b>          He starts frantically pumping down his window, shouting:
          . CLIVE! You gonna send your mother next?! You little
          bastard! I wanna see you! I wanna-
          Crash.
          He has rear-ended someone.
          A blaring horn, a quick second crash: wrenching steel and spattering
          glass.
          He has been rear-ended in turn.
          The ka-ching of the bicycle. CLIVE Park cycles past without looking.

          After a long beat:

<b>          LARRY

          so strapped for cash right now-paying for the Jolly Roger,
          and I wrecked the car, and DANNY's bar mitzvah... I...

          Something like this-there's never a good time.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I don't know where it all leaves me. Sy's death. Obviously

          Mm. Would you even want that, LARRY?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          No, I-well yeah! Sometimes! Or-I don't know; I guess
          the honest answer is I don't know. What was my life
          before? Not what I thought it was. What does it all mean?
          What is Hashem trying to tell me, making me pay for Sy
          Ableman's funeral?
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Mm.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          And-did I tell you I had a car accident the same time Sy
          had his? The same instant, for all I know. Is Hashem
          telling me that Sy Ableman is me, or we are all one or
          something?

<b>          LARRY

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Uh-huh.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Right next to the Gold Eagle Cleaners.
          We cut to:

<b>          SIGN FOR THE GOLD EAGLE CLEANERS
</b>          It dominates a small suburban strip mall.
          Rabbi Nachtner continues in voice-over as we cut to a smoked
          glass door that identifies
          Leon Sussman, DDS.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          He's making a plaster mold-it's for corrective bridge
          work-in the mouth of one of his patients...
          A close shot of a man's mouth biting down on two horse-shoe shaped
          troughs-an upper
          and a lower-that overflow an oozing white goo.
          . Russell Kraus. He's a delivery dispatcher for the Star
          and Tribune with chronic mandicular deterioration.
          The grinding guitar solo from Jefferson Airplane's "Bear Melt"
          scores the narrative.
          The patient opens his mouth as a hand enters to grab the upper
          tray.
          The reverse shows Dr. Sussman, a balding middle-aged man, dressed
          in the the high-
          collared white smock of an oral surgeon. He carries the mold
          over to a drying table.
          Kraus is twisted over the side of the chair spitting into the
          water-swirled spit-sink.
          . Well, the mold dries and Lee is examining it one day

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          83
</b>          before fabricating an appliance...
          Another day: Dr. Sussman is sitting at his desk examining the
          lower mold. He notices
          something unusual.
          . He notices something unusual.
          Sussman reaches up for the loupe attached to his eyeglasses.
          There seems to be something engraved on the inside of the
          patient's lower incisors...
          He flips down the loupe. His eyes are hugely magnified as he
          stares.
          Sure enough, it's writing.
          Sussman squints.
          His point-of-view: Tiny incised Hebrew letters:
          sml�nn

<b>          BACK TO RABBI NACHTNER
</b>          He confirms with a nod.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          This in a goy's mouth, LARRY.

<b>          BACK TO LEON SUSSMAN
</b>          The Rabbi's narrative continues.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Tet resh nun lamed nun shin tsayin. What is that-tiranu
          linoshets? "Help me"? Is that what it says? Or is it a
          name? It's not Kraus's name.
          Sussman flips the loupe away and looks off, haunted. He rises.
          He checks the mold, just to be sure. Oh, it's there all

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          84
</b>          right...
          A dental mirror is dipped into the horse-shoe-shaped hardened
          paste of the mold. It pans
          tiny letters that stand out in relief, right-side around in the
          mirror:
          yw .rin
          Sussman leans back, thinking.
          He calls the goy back on the pretense of needing additional
          measurements for the appliance...
          Close on Kraus grinning as he shakes Sussman's hand in the reception
          area. Sussman
          gestures to invite Kraus back to the examination room.
          Sussman chats, affecting nonchalance.
          In the examination room, leaning over Kraus in the chair, the
          dentist is indeed chatting
          with seeming casualness.
          Notice any other problems with your teeth? Anything
          peculiar, et cetera?
          Sussman takes a dental mirror.
          No. No. No. Visited any other dentist recently?
          He looks in Kraus' mouth with the mirror:
          Ym nn
          Sussman frowns.
          There it is. "Help me"?
          He leans back.
          Sussman goes home. Can Sussman eat? No.
          Sussman sits at the kitchen table, untouched food in front of
          him. His wife chats volubly
          while Sussman stares into space.
          Can Sussman sleep? No.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          85
</b>          Sussman is in bed, pyjamas buttoned to the neck, staring at the
          ceiling.
          What does it mean? Is it a message for him, for Sussman?
          And if so, from whom? Does Sussman know? Sussman
          doesn't know.
          Back in the dental office Sussman pulls boxes containing other
          molds off the shelf.
          Sussman looks at the molds of his other patients, goy and
          Jew alike, seeking other messages. He finds none. He
          looks in his own mouth...
          Close on Sussman in front of a mirror straining to see the reflection
          of a reflection of the
          dental mirror he holds in his own mouth.
          . Nothing. His wife's mouth...
          Sussman's wife lies asleep on her back, her mouth open, snoring
          softly. Sussman, in
          pyjamas but with his glasses on and loupe in place, lies over
          her in bed, supporting
          himself with one arm thrown across her body. He leans awkwardly

          lowering a dental mirror into his wife's open mouth.
          . Nothing. It is a singular event. A mystery.
          The Jefferson Airplane guitar solo is heating up.
          But Sussman is an educated man. Not the world's greatest
          sage, maybe, no Rabbi Minda, but he knows a thing or two
          from the Zohar and the Caballah. He knows every Hebrew
          letter has its numeric equivalent.
          Sussman, still in his pyjamas is sitting at the kitchen table
          scribbling on a tablet of lined
          paper.
          Close on the paper: the Hebrew letters have been transcribed
          into their numeric

<b>          EQUIVALENTS:

<b>          496-2428
</b>          Nachtner continues in voice-over:

<b>          
</b>
<b>          86
</b>          Seven digits-a phone number maybe?
          Sussman reaches for the phone. He hesitates a moment, then dials.
          . Sussman dials. It rings.

<b>          AN ELEVATED CUBICLE
</b>          In a grocery store. A man in short sleeves reaches for the phone.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          It's a Red Owl grocery store in Bloomington. Hello? Do
          you know a goy named Kraus? Russel Kraus?
          The store manager is shaking his head.
          Where have I called? The Red Owl. In Bloomington.
          Thanks so much.
          The manager, puzzled, hangs up.
          Sussman thinks, am I supposed to go to the Red Owl, to
          receive a further sign? He goes...
          In the parking lot of the Red Owl Sussman, wearing a short-brimmed
          fedora, emerges
          from his car. It is an unremarkable grocery store in a suburban
          mall.
          It's a Red Owl.
          Inside Sussman, in his fedora, gazes around.
          Groceries. What have you.
          A service alley behind the store: dumpsters, wind-blown garbage,
          Sussman looking.
          On the wall behind the store, a stain...
          There is an old, rather nondescript stain of some liquid splatted
          against the back wall and
          long since dribbled away.
          . Could be a nun sofit... Or maybe not...
          The parking lot again: Sussman gets back in his car.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          87
</b>          Sussman goes home. What does it mean? He has to find
          out, if he's ever to sleep again.
          Sussman again, in pyjamas buttoned to the neck, lies in his bed
          staring at the ceiling.
          He goes to see the Rabbi, Nachtner. He comes in and sits
          right where you're sitting now.
          Sussman is indeed sitting across from Rabbi Nachtner, just where
          we've seen LARRY
          sitting.
          What does it mean, Rabbi? Is it a sign from Hashem?
          "Help me." I, Sussman, should be doing something to help
          this goy? Doing what? The teeth don't say. I should know
          without asking? Or maybe I'm supposed to help people
          generally-lead a more righteous life? Is the answer in
          cabalah? In torah? Or is there even a question? Tell me,
          Rabbi-what can such a sign mean?
          Nachtner-not the narrating Nachtner but the Nachtner in the scene-nods
          and
          considers.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Staring at the Rabbi. He waits a good beat.
          He prompts:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          So what did you tell him?
          The Rabbi seems surprised by the question.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Sussman?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Yes!
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Is it. . relevant?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          88
</b>
<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well-isn't that why you're telling me?
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Mm. Okay. Nachtner says, look.. .
          We are back in the scene, narrated by voice-over, of the Rabbi
          silently advising the
          fretful Sussman.
          . The teeth, we don't know. A sign from Hashem, don't
          know. Helping others, couldn't hurt.
          LARRY's voice-over question plays over Sussman asking the same
          thing:
          LARRY (of])
          But is that what it meant?-tet resh nun lamed nun shin
          isayin, was it "Help me"? or a number? Or was it
          Rabbi Nachtner (off)
          We can't know everything.
          Sussman stares blankly at the Rabbi.
          A beat.
          LARRY (of])
          It sounds like you don't know Mthing!

<b>          THE RABBI
</b>          Smiling equably at LARRY. He reacts to the ejaculation with a
          shrug.
          LARRY scowls.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Why even tell me the story?
          Rabbi Nachtner

<b>          (AMUSED)
</b>          First I should tell you, then I shouldn't.

</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          89
</b>          LARRY, exasporated, changes tack:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          What happened to Sussman?

<b>          SUSSMAN
</b>          In his office. Working on different patients as the Rabbi resumes
          his voice-over.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          What would happen? Not much. He went back to work.
          For a while he checked every patient's teeth for new
          messages; didn't see any; in time, he found he'd stopped
          checking.
          Sussman, at home, chats with his wife over dinner.
          . These questions that are bothering you, LARRY-maybe
          they're like a toothache. We feel them for a while, then
          they go away.
          Sussman lies in bed sleeping, smiling, an arm thrown across his
          wife.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Dissatisfied.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I don't want it to just go away! I want an answer!
          Rabbi Nachtner
          The answer! Sure! We all want the answer! But Hashem
          doesn't owe us the answer, LARRY. Hashem doesn't owe us
          anything. The obligation runs the other way.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Why does he make us feel the questions if he's not gonna
          give us any answers?
          Rabbi Nachtner smiles at LARRY for a beat.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          90
</b>          Rabbi Nachtner
          He hasn't told me.
          LARRY rubs his face, frustrated.
          A last question occurs to him:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          And what happened to the goy?
          Rabbi Nachtner's forebearing smile fades into puzzlement.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          The goy? Who cares?

<b>          EXTERIOR: THE SYNAGOGUE
</b>          The modern synagogue grafted onto a patch of prairie.
          An echoing voice rings out:

<b>          VOICE
</b>          Sy Ableman was a serious man!

<b>          RABBI NACHTNER
</b>          In close-up he gazes around, weighing the effect of the words
          just delivered.
          After a long beat during which he seeks to establish eye contact
          with as much of his
          audience as possible:
          Rabbi Nachtner
          . Sy Ableman was a man devoted to his community...
          Wider shows Rabbi Nachtner up on the bema. He and the congregation
          face each other
          across a casket down at floor level.
          . to torah study...
          LARRY sits among the congregants, his gaze fixed on a point off.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          91
</b>          . to his beloved wife Esther until, three years ago, she
          passed.. .
          LARRY's point-of-view: JUDY is visible from 3 behind. She sits
          a few rows ahead looking
          grimly up at the rabbi.
          . and to his duty, as he saw it. Where does such a man
          go? A tzadik-who knows, maybe even a lamid vovnik-a
          man beloved by all, a man who despised the frivolous?
          Could such a serious man... simply... disappear?
          The words echo.
          Again the rabbi gazes around, as if awaiting answer.

<b>          THEN:
</b>          . We speak of L'olam ha-ba, the World to Come. Not
          heaven. Not what the gentiles think of as afterlife.
          "L'olam ha-ba." What is L'olam ha-ba? Where is L'olam
          ha-ba? Well: it is not a geoaraphic place, certainly.
          Like-Canada.
          Murmured chuckles from the congregation.
          Nor is it the eretz zavat chalav ood'vash-the land flowing
          with milk and honey, for we are not promised a personal
          reward, a gold star, a first-class VIP lounge where we get
          milk and cookies to eternity!
          More chuckles.
          L'olam ha-ba... is in the bosom of Abraham. L'olam ba-
          ba is in the soul of this community which nurtured Sy
          Ableman and to which Sy Ableman now returns. That's
          right, he returns. Because he still inspires us Ableman
          returns. Because his memory instructs us Ableman
          returns. Because his thoughts illuminate our days and ways
          Sy Ableman returns. The frivolous man may vanish
          without a ripple but Sy Ableman? Sy Ableman was a
          serious man...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          92
</b>          A sob echoes through the sanctuary.
          LARRY looks at Judith, who stifles further sobs with a handkerchief.
          . As you know, the mourner's kaddish does not mention
          the dead. It praises Hashem; it praises what abides. And
          Sy Ableman, whose spirit will continue to assist us in
          tikkun olam, is with us even now, a serious man who would
          say as we now say Yiskadal v'yiskadash sh'may rabah...
          The congregation begins to chant along but it and Judith's weeping
          are cut off by:

<b>          A HAND RAPPING AT A DOOR
</b>          The front door to the Gopnik home.
          LARRY, still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka, opens
          the door. He recoils in
          surprise edged with fear.
          Reverse: two uniformed policemen.

<b>          COP 1
</b>          Arthur Gopnik?
          LARRY is momentarily dumb. Inside the house we can see a corner
          of a card table set up in
          the living room with food laid out on it. SARAH sits with her
          back to us, head wrapped by
          a towel-turban. Arthur, on the far side of the table, his balding
          head domed by a yarmul-
          ka, half-leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men
          at the door without totally
          revealing himself. From somewhere down the hall come Judith's
          muffled sobs.
          . Are you Arthur Gopnik?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I'm... Laurence Gopnik.
          Cop I
          Do you go by the name Arthur Gopnik?

          Arthur ducks away.
          From inside the living room:
          DANNY (off)
          Dad? What's going on?

<b>          LARRY

</b>          You're what.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          A religious observance. We're... bereaved.
          The cop standing behind gazes in over his partner's shoulder.

</b>          Who died?

          breaking the law. We're not arresting him now but next
          time we will. Gambling is against the law in this state.
          That's just the way it is. All right. Go back to your...

<b>          COP 2
</b>          Sorry, sir.

<b>          LIVING ROOM
</b>          A minute later. The family-except for Judith, whose weeping continues
          off-sits
          around the card table. A long beat.
          At length:

          LARRY's gaze swings onto his son.

</b>          Well, um...

          Silence. Arthur sneaks a look at DANNY.
          LARRY looks back and forth between them.
          . What's going on?
          Arthur shrugs.

          LARRY is wincing as he rubs a forearm under his shirtsleeve.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Just a sunburn. I've been spending a lot of time on the
          roof. For... perspective.
          He trails off and his head drops back down onto his arms. Don
          gives him an appraising
          look.

<b>          DON
</b>          . Have you seen the Rabbi?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          (muffled again)
          Talked to Nachtner.

<b>          DON
</b>          You should talk to Minda.

<b>          LARRY
</b>           They told me Minda doesn't do pastoral work any more.
          Just.. . ceremonial.

<b>          DON
</b>          Mm. Congratulates the bar mitzvah boy every week, so
          forth?
          LARRY nods miserably.
          . That's too bad. A very wise man, Minda.
          LARRY raises his head.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Getting old.

<b>          DON
</b>          Very old.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          No, me.

</b>
<b>          DON
</b>          LARRY, you're fine. It's a bump in the road. Was Nachtner
          helpful at all?
          LARRY gives a helpless shrug.
          Don rolls his eyes.
          . What-did he tell you about the goy's teeth?
          A knock on the door. Don projects:
          Yeah?
          The door cracks open. A pipe edges in, followed by a peeking
          face: Solomon Schlutz.
          . Oh, good! Sol, come on in.
          Solomon Schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and suspenders.
          He has the smooth
          impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its teeth.
          He glides into the room, a sheaf of files tucked under one arm.
          . Sol has been looking into the property-line issues.. .
          Solomon Schlutz seats himself at the conference table and starts
          sorting and arranging
          the files into three piles.
          . It seems that you do have a real problem with the
          original survey. But Sol seems to think there's some kind
          of nifty way for us to-well, I haven't heard it myself, I'll
          let Sol map it out.
          Solomon Schlutz continues to arrange the files, his eye occasionally
          lingering on a
          specific page. When at length he is finished he carefully justifies
          the edges of the closest
          pile, takes the pipe out of his mouth, gives LARRY a smile that
          seems to take some effort,
          and then taps the pipe in a large glass ashtray.
          He looks up again at LARRY, this time shocked. His stunned look
          on LARRY holds for a
          long beat.
          LARRY returns a bewildered look.

<b>

</b>          Solomon Schlutz, staring at LARRY as if he were some sort of
          monster, emits one barking

<b>          SYLLABLE:
</b>          Solomon Schlutz
          Gah!
          His stare holds. He reddens.

<b>          DON
</b>          .Sol?
          Solomon Schlutz's face now passes from the red end of the spectrum
          to the purple.
          Solomon Schlutz
          Nnnnff!
          The pipe clatters out of his hand. The hand grabs at his own
          shirt front.
          . Glufffl...
          Now his head pitches back. His backflung weight and twisting
          body send his chair
          tipping over, one hand still clutching at his chest while the
          other frantically waves. He
          disappears behind the conference table and lands with a floor-shaking
          thump. His
          writhing and gurgling remain audible.

<b>          DON
</b>          Sol! Sol!
          Don Milgram has risen to look down at his fallen colleague; now
          he flings open the
          conference room door and bellows into the office:
          An ambulance! Quick! Somebody call an ambulance! A

</b>          LARRY walks into the outer office clutching his briefcase, eyes
          wide, shell-shocked. The
          secretary is at her typewriter but holding the phone, one hand
          covering its mouthpiece.

<b>          SECRETARY
</b>          Dick Dutton. Columbia Record Club.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Call back.

<b>          HIS OFFICE
</b>          LARRY sits in heavily behind his desk.
          A beat.
          He opens the top left desk drawer. He withdraws the bulging white
          envelope and opens
          its flap.
          He runs a finger over the wad of bills.

<b>          VOICE
</b>
<b>          LARRY?
</b>          He looks up, startled.
          Arlen Finkle stands in the doorway.
          . As you know, the tenure committee meets-are you all
          right?
          LARRY sits frozen with the white envelope in his hands.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I'm... fine.
          Arlen Finkle
          I'm sorry. I know you've hit a rough patch.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Thank you. I'm fine.
          He puts the envelope in the desk drawer and closes it.

</b>
<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arlen, I am not an evil man!
          Arlen looks at him, shocked.

          LARRY! Of course not!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I am not-
          Arlen Finkle
          We don't make moral judgments!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I went to the Aster Art once. I saw Swedish Reverie.
          Arlen Finkle
          It's okay, LARRY, we don't need to know! The Tenure

<b>          COMMITTEE-
</b>
<b>          LARRY
</b>          It wasn't even erotic! Although it was, in a way.
          Arlen Finkle
          It's all right, LARRY. Believe me.
          LARRY calms somewhat.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . Okay.
          Arlen Finkle
          Okay. Okay. We, uh, we decide on Wednesday, so if
          there's anything you want to submit in support of your
          tenure application, we should have it by then. That's all.

<b>          LARRY

<b>

          Arlen Finkle
          Well. Anything. Published work. Anything else you've

          be aware of.

<b>          LARRY

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Are you still getting those letters?
          Arlen Finkle
          Uh-huh.

</b>          Those anonymous-
          Arlen Finkle
          Yes, I know. Yes.
          A beat. LARRY nods.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Okay. Okay. Wednesday.
          Arlen Finkle
          Okay. Don't worry. Doing nothing is not bad. Ipso facto.

<b>          LARRY

<b>          CLASSROOM
</b>          We are close over LARRY's shoulder as he scribbles symbols onto
          the chalkboard.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . and that means... so that... from which we derive...
          His glances back toward the class show that he is wearier, baggier-eyed,
          more haggard
          than ever. There is also something odd about his posture.
          He writes smaller and smaller so as to finish before hitting
          the right edge of the
          chalkboard.
          . and also.. which lets us... and...
          Wider as he finishes and straightens up, revealing that he has
          been stooping to write
          across the very bottom of the board.
          The equation covers every inch of the classroom-wide three-paneled
          chalkboard. LARRY
          is an off balance figure at the right edge of frame.
          Reverse on the class: staring.
          Okay?
          LARRY claps chalk dust from his hands.
          . The Uncertainty Principle. It proves we can't ever
          really know... what's going on.
          A bell sounds. The students start to shake off their stupor and
          rise. LARRY projects over
          the wallah:
          . So it shouldn't bother you. Not being able to figure
          anything out. Although you will be responsible for this on
          the mid-term.
          The thinning crowd gradually reveals one person still seated:
          Sy Ableman.
          He wears a prayer shawl and yarmulka.

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          105
</b>          LARRY does not seem surprised to see him.
          . Did you follow that?
          Sy Ableman
          Of coss. Except that I know what's going on. How do you
          explain.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well, it might be that, in, you know, in L'olam ha-bah-
          Sy Ableman
          Excuse me. Not the issue. In this world, LARRY.
          He nods at the chalkboard.
          . I'll concede that it's subtle. It's clevva. But at the end
          of the day, is it convincing?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Well-yes it's convincing. It's a proof. It's mathematics.
          Sy Ableman
          Excuse me, LARRY. Mathematics. Is the art of the possible.
          LARRY's brow furrows.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I don't think so. The art of the possible, that's... I can't
          remember... something else...
          Sy Ableman
          I'm a serious man, LARRY.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I know that. So if I've got it wrong, what do I-
          Sy Ableman holds up one hand to silence him.
          Sy Ableman
          So simple, LARRY. See Minda.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>

<b>

</b>
<b>          LARRY
</b>          I know, I want to see Minda! I want to see Minda! They
          told me that oonh!
          Without our having seen him rise or cross the room Sy Ableman
          has body-slammed
          LARRY into the chalkboard. Now he grabs LARRY by the hair and
          whips his head against
          the equation. As he slams LARRY's head, again and again, the
          chalkboard chatters and the
          fringes on Sy's tallis dance.
          Sy Ableman
          See Minda! See Minda! I fucked your wife, LARRY! I
          seriously fucked her! That's what's going on! See Minda!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Very close on his eyes as they open. His head is on a pillow.
          Dull early light. A hissing
          sound.
          LARRY looks blearily over.
          On the vanity table just outside the motel bathroom door sits
          Uncle Arthur's cyst
          evacuator. Its waggling hose snakes into the cracked bathroom
          door as the machine
          hisses.

<b>          MEZUZA
</b>          On a doorpost.
          A hand enters to knock. A long beat. The person knocking gives
          up and his footsteps
          start to go away just as the door opens to reveal an attractive
          woman the sunbathing
          neighbor, now wearing plaid shorts and a buttoned white blouse.
          Her point-of-view: LARRY, frozen halfway down the stoop, head
          turned back up toward
          the door.

<b>          WOMAN
</b>          Mr. Gopnik.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Oh. Hello, Mrs. Samsky. I knocked, and then thought you
          weren't here. I, uh...
          Mrs. Samsky's voice is soft and breathy:
          Mrs. Samsky
          It just took me a second to get to the door. I was out back.
          LARRY stands nodding.
          He seems to need prompting. Mrs. Samsky does:
          . Can I help you? Wanna come in?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          No, I-
          One hand on the door, she steps back.
          Mrs. Samsky
          It's cooler.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Oh. Okay. I just wanted to let you know...
          He is entering.

<b>          INSIDE
</b>          After the outside glare the house does indeed seem cooler. LARRY
          looks around the living
          room, dim but neat. Wavering light sifts through closed vertical
          blinds which drift and
          click over floor-vented air-conditioning.
          Mrs. Samsky closes the door, shutting out all sound from outside.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I've noticed that Mr. Samsky isn't around, and I-
          Mrs. Samsky
          He travels.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Uh-huh. Yeah, I never seem to see him, so I thought I
          should let you know, since you're somewhat new here, if
          you ever have, whatever, chores that you'd, um, or just help
          with something-I've decided to help others-you know,
          in a neighborly way...
          She gazes at him with the least hint of a smile and waits for
          the speech to dribble away to
          silence. In the ensuing beat, quiet except for the clicking of
          the blinds, she is perfectly
          still. Finally, only her mouth moves:
          Mrs. Samsky
          How thoughtful.
          LARRY shrugs off the compliment.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Oh it's nothing. It's just good to know your neighbors.
          And to help. Help others. Although I don't care much for
          my neighbors on the other side, I must say.
          Mrs. Samsky lets another smiling silence pass before responding.
          Mrs. Samsky
          . Goys, aren't they?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Mm. Very much so. Maybe it's not fair to judge; I have to
          admit I-
          Mrs. Samsky
          Won't you sit down?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Oh! Um. Okay. Thank you.
          Mrs. Samsky
          Iced tea? I have some.
          She is already turning to the kitchen.

<b>

<b>          LARRY

          He watches her and reacts to:
          The backs of her thighs. The flesh retains the broad cross-hatch
          of her lawn chair.
          She disappears into the kitchen, but calls out:
          Mrs. Samsky
          I don't see you around much, either.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Yes. Actually I haven't been home a lot recently, I, uh, my
          wife and I are, uh, well, she's got me staying at the Jolly
          Roger, the little motel there on-
          Mrs. Samsky is reentering with two tall glasses of iced tea beaded
          with moisture. The
          click of the ice cubes joins the clicking of the blinds.
          Mrs. Samsky
          You're in the doghouse, huh?
          She hands him a glass as she sits on the couch next to him, not
          invasively close, one bare
          leg folded onto the couch, the other draped over it.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Yeah, that's an understatement I guess, I -thank you-I,

<b>          UH-
</b>          Mrs. Samsky
          Do you take advantage of the new freedoms?
          LARRY stares at her. Mrs. Samsky gazes back. Her look displays
          equanimity; his, not.

<b>          FINALLY:
</b>
<b>          LARRY
</b>          . What do you mean.
          Her look holds for one more beat and then she swivels and opens
          the drawer of an end
          table.

<b>

<b>

<b>

          Mrs. Samsky
          It's something I do. For recreation.
          She lights it.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          That's... Marijuana?
          Mrs. Samsky
          Mm-hmm.
          She hands the joint over.
          . You'll find you'll need the iced tea.
          LARRY handles the bitty cigarette with trepidation.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Is it. . well.. . okay...

<b>          THE VERTICAL BLINDS
</b>          Some minutes later. They drift and click in the air blown from
          the floor vents.
          LARRY stares at them.
          After a long beat:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Maybe Rabbi Scott was right.
          Mrs. Samsky
          Who's Rabbi Scott?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          The junior rabbi.
          Mrs. Samsky
          The junior rabbi.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          111
</b>          Another long beat. Neither person feels compelled to speak as
          the blinds click.
          The joint makes another trip back and forth.

<b>          THEN:
</b>          . What did he say?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          He spoke of.. perception. All my problems are just...
          just a... a mere..
          He trails off, listening.
          . Is that a siren?
          Mrs. Samsky
          No. Some people get a little paranoid when they... Holy
          cow... That is a siren.

<b>          OUTSIDE
</b>          The Samsky's door opens and LARRY stumbles out. He stares.
          The police car has stopped in front of his own house next door,
          lights still flashing. Two
          cops are going up the walk with Uncle Arthur between them in
          handcuffs.
          LARRY, stunned, walks woodenly toward his house.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Hey!
          Neither the cops nor Uncle Arthur has heard. They have rung the
          doorbell and now
          disappear inside.
          LARRY projects louder-

<b>          . HEY!
</b>          -and starts to sprint. Mrs. Samsky has emerged from her house
          behind.
          LARRY takes the stoop steps two at a time. His door stands open
          and the theme from F

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          112
</b>          Troop issues from within.
          Just inside the two policeman stand with their backs to us and
          handcuffed Uncle Arthur
          in between. The three men face DANNY, who addresses them, projecting
          over the music
          from the TV.

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Sort of. He sleeps on the couch.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          This is crazy!
          This brings the cops' look around. Uncle Arthur also turns, shamefaced,
          to LARRY.

<b>          COP
</b>          Does this man live here?

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          I didn't know what to tell them! They asked for my
          address.. .

<b>          LARRY
</b>          It's just mathematics! You can't arrest a man for
          mathematics!

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          I didn't know whether to say I lived here or at the Jolly
          Roger.

<b>          COP
</b>          You know this man?

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          I figured this would sound more... I don't know...
          Mrs. Samsky appears behind LARRY on the stoop.

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Dad, why is Uncle Arthur in handcuffs?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          It's all a mistake. I mean, not a mistake, a, a-

</b>
<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Hello, Mrs. Samsky.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          -a miscarriage-

<b>          COP
</b>          Does this man live here?

<b>          DANNY
</b>          He sleeps on the couch.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Look! What did he do!

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Nothing! I didn't do anything!

<b>          DANNY
</b>          It folds out. Dad sleeps on a cot.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          You can't just-

<b>          COP
</b>          Sir, we picked this man up at the North Dakota.
          LARRY is brought up short.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          The North Dakota!

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          But I didn't do anything!

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Dad, what's the North Dakota?

<b>          COP
</b>          Solicitation. Sodomy. Very serious.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          114
</b>
<b>          LARRY
</b>          . The North Dakota!
          We hold on LARRY's shocked reaction as we hear DANNY, off:

<b>          DANNY
</b>          What's Sodomy, Dad?

<b>          DON MILGRAM
</b>          He wears a black armband. He sits thinking, bouncing steepled
          fingers against his nose.

<b>          FINALLY:
</b>
<b>          DON
</b>          What does Arthur say?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          He says he didn't do anything.

<b>          DON
</b>          Uh-huh.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          He says. . . he just went in for a drink.

<b>          DON
</b>          Uh-huh.
          Long beat.
          . Does Arthur drink?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          No.

<b>          DON
</b>          Uls-huh.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          . He says he was confused.

<b>          DON
</b>          Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well. The North Dakota. Well. You'll
          need a criminal attorney.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Okay. Who's-

<b>          DON
</b>          Ron Meshbesher.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Is he good?

<b>          DON
</b>          Ron is very good.
          LARRY's gaze wanders. He becomes wistful.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I don't understand. He goes to mixers at the Hillel House.

<b>          DON
</b>          Mm.
          A beat.
          . I would call Ron Meshbesher.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Is he expensive?

<b>          DON
</b>          Ron is not cheap.
          Don focuses on LARRY. Cheerful change of subject:
          . DANNY's bar mitzvah is... ?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          This week.

<b>          
</b>

<b>          116
</b>
<b>          DON
</b>          This shabbas! Great!
          He nods.
          . It'll be okay. Try to relax, LARRY. Try to relax.

<b>          MRS. SAMSKY'S BEDROOM
</b>          LARRY is making strenuous love to Mrs. Samsky.
          Mrs. Samsky
          So good... so good...
          She rolls on top of LARRY to straddle him and, still humping,
          she lights a mentholated
          cigarette. LARRY moans.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Oh my God, Mrs. Samsky...
          Beyond her head LARRY can see the low cottage-cheese ceiling
          of the bedroom. Outside
          we can hear Gar Brandt mowing the lawn.
          Suddenly we hear muffled laughter and the front door opening.
          LARRY panics. He hisses:
          . Who is it?
          Footsteps are approaching along the hall. Mrs. Samsky doesn't
          react; she looks calmly
          down at LARRY even as the bedroom door opens behind her and CLIVE
          Park walks in
          wearing a traffic mask. LARRY is mortified:
          CLIVE, please! Wait outside!
          Mrs. Samsky blows smoke into LARRY's eyes. The screen goes black.
          Close on LARRY as he opens his eyes. A shadow falls across his
          face.
          His point-of-view: a wooden plank is just being slid into place
          over his head. The bang
          of hammer on nailhead. In the black:

</b>
<b>          117
</b>          Sy Ableman's Voice
          Nailing it down is so impawtant.
          We hear the chanting of Kaddish and the sound of dirt hitting
          the top of the coffin. It
          drums a steady rhythm. Grace Slick's voice enters: "Somebody
          to Love." In a break in
          the vocals right before the chorus:
          Mrs. Samsky's Voice
          It's something we do. For recreation.
          On the chorus downbeat, a crescent moon pops into the black.
          Gar Brandt traverses the
          sky, pushing his lawn mower. A cow flies the opposite way. Stars
          twinkle. Sy Able-
          man walks across the sky dressed like a shtetl elder, a bindlestick
          over one shoulder.
          LARRY bolts upright in bed.
          Sudden quiet.
          Uncle Arthur is snoring in the tatty motel room's other bed.
          A title burns in:

<b>          MINDA

<b>          LARRY
</b>          He stands looking down in low shot. Above him is cheap Johnson-Armstrong
          dropped
          ceiling.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Please. I need help. I've already talked to the other rabbis.
          Please.
          Reverse shows an elderly eastern European woman seated behind
          a desk, looking up at

<b>          LARRY.
</b>          . I won't take much of his time. I need help. I need

          DANNY. This coming shabbas. Very joyous event. That's
          all fine. It's, it's more about myself, I've... I've had quite
          a bit of tsuris lately. Marital problems. Professional. You
          name it. This is not a frivolous request. This is a serious-

          raise the, raise the, DANNY, SARAH, they both go to school,
          Hebrew school, a good breakfast. Well, DANNY goes to
          Hebrew school, SARAH doesn't have time, she mostly...
          washes her hair. Apparently there are several steps
          involved. But you don't have to tell Minda that. Just tell
          him I need help. Please. I need help.
          He lapses into silence, staring at the secretary.
          She stares inscrutably back.
          After a moment she rises, goes to the door behind her, opens
          it, shuffles into the dimness
          of an inner office.
          LARRY cranes to see past her. Her own body and the dimness interfere
          with a good view
          of the figure hunched behind the desk. The man is old and bent.
          His desktop is empty.
          Murmured voices in Hebrew.
          A clock ticks in the outer office. LARRY looks around, waiting.
          Mysterious Judaica adorns the outer office.
          The old woman is shuffling back. She closes the door on the motionless
          rabbi and sits
          down, heavily, behind her own desk.

<b>          SECRETARY
</b>          The rabbi is busy.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          He didn't look busy!
          As she starts shuffling papers:

<b>          SECRETARY
</b>          He's thinking.

<b>          NIGHT
</b>          Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut.

</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          119
</b>          We are booming down on LARRY, asleep in bed.
          We hear weeping, soft, suppressed.
          LARRY stirs. He opens his eyes.
          After a groggy beat he reacts to the weeping. He looks over.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur... ? Arthur?
          Arthur is a dim mound on the next bed. His weeping continues.
          For no reason LARRY continues to keep his voice to a whisper:
          . Arthur. What's wrong?
          No answer.
          . Arthur. It'll be okay. Arthur. We'll get Ron
          Meshbesher. It'll be okay-

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>
<b>          AAAHHHH!
</b>          Shockingy loud, the scream is hard to interpret.
          Arthur flings off his bedclothes. He leaps from the bed and runs
          to the door. In boxer
          shorts and undershirt he flings the door open and runs out of
          the room.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur!
          LARRY leaps from his bed, also in his underwear.
          He goes to the door but pauses, peering cautiously outside. Satisfied
          that the courtyard is
          deserted, he plunges into it.

<b>          COURTYARD
</b>          The courtyard/parking lot is hardlit by ghastly mercury vapor
          lights. The pool,
          surrounded by chain-link fence, has been drained. Its white concrete
          interior is cracked

<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          120
</b>          and weedy.
          Uncle Arthur is hunched weeping in a corner of the pool enclosure.

<b>          LARRY
</b>
<b>          (HISSING)
</b>          Arthur!
          He opens the creaking gate and scurries over to Arthur.
          . You've got to pull yourself together!
          Arthur is suddenly angry. His voice bounces off the concrete:

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          It's all shit, LARRY! It's all shit!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur. Don't use that word.

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          It's all fucking shit!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur! Come on!

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Look at everything Hashem has given you! And what do I
          get! I get fucking shit!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur. What do I have. I live at the Jolly Roger.

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          You've got a family. You've got a job. Hashem hasn't
          given me bupkes.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          It's not fair to blame Hashem, Arthur. Please. Sometimes
          -please calm down-sometimes you have to help your-
          self.

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>

</b>          Don't blame me! You fucker!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur. Please.

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Hashem hasn't given me shit. Now I can't even play cards.
          He starts weeping again.
          LARRY looks around.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur. This isn't the right forum. Please. Not by the
          pool.
          Arthur weeps.
          Arthur... It's okay... It's okay...

<b>          MORNING
</b>          LARRY and Arthur are driving. We are looking at the two of them
          square through a
          windshield in which towering conifers stream by in reflection.
          It seems to be a glorious
          day.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Is this it?
          Both men peer out.

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          I think so... yeah... there...
          He indicates the road ahead.

<b>          A SIGNPOST
</b>          The old-fashioned kind with wooden fingers pointing the different
          directions.
          One points toward CANADA.

</b>

</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          122
</b>          We tip off the sign as LARRY's car passes and recedes. There
          is a canoe strapped to its
          roof.

<b>          BOUNDARY WATERS
</b>          Beautiful, wooded, remote.
          The car is parked at water's edge, having backed down a lane
          of two tracks worn
          through the undergrowth. LARRY and Arthur are lowering the canoe
          into water.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Okay.. .
          He straightens. Arthur straightens. LARRY hugs him.
          .Look...
          They separate and LARRY pulls a white envelope from his pocket
          and gives it to Arthur.
          . This'll help you get back on your feet.
          Arthur looks into the envelope.

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Oh my God. Where did you get this?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Doesn't matter. When you-

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          This is a lot of money!

<b>          LARRY
</b>          It should get you started.

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          This is a lot of money! Are you sure you don't need it?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Arthur, I'm fine. Come on, get in. When you're settled...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          123

          He helps push the boat off. Arthur is twisted around, looking
          back. As he drifts off:

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Are you sure this is okay?

<b>          LARRY
</b>          It's fine. It's fine...
          LARRY waves.
          Arthur waves bravely back, then turns to pick up the oars. A
          couple of strokes and he
          turns back again with a last thought. He calls:

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          LARRY. I'm sorry. What I said last night.

<b>          LARRY
</b>          I know. It's okay.
          A lingering look from Arthur, and then he turns back to row.
          A gunshot.
          Blood spurts from the back of Uncle Arthur's neck.
          He slumps forward, dead.

<b>          VOICE
</b>          Good shot!
          LARRY looks wildly around. He sees:
          Gar Brandt and Mitch in their camo fatigues, hard to pick out
          in the foliage. They are
          looking off toward the canoe, Mitch just lowering his rifle.
          Gar Brandt's look swings around, into the lens. He points at
          us:
          There's another Jew, son.

          He looks around.
          It is dawn.
          Arthur sits on the edge of his bed in his underwear, staring
          off into space, slackjawed,
          vacant-eyed, drained.
          LARRY gazes around the room, waiting for things to fall into
          place.
          Finally, blearily:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          Were we... out at the pool last night?
          Arthur, still staring off, responds in a flat, empty voice:

<b>          ARTHUR
</b>          Yes. I'm sorry.
          LARRY blinks sleep away.
          After a beat:

<b>          LARRY
</b>          It's shabbas.

<b>          SANCTUARY
</b>          DANNY, seated in the second pew next to his parents and sister
          and Uncle Arthur, rises
          and shuffles along the row to the aisle. His eyes are wide and
          red-rimmed.
          The prelapped voice was his call to the torah. All eyes in the
          congregation, which fills
          the large sanctuary, are on him.
          In great echoing silence he walks to the steps on the right side
          of the bema and climbs.
          The right-side lectern is surrounded by a gaggle of old Jewish
          men. They busy
          themselves with the preparation of the pair of scrolls on the
          lectern, rolling them,
          pausing, rolling some more, muttering prayers, kissing the scrolls
          by means of their
          tsitsim. They pay DANNY no attention.
          DANNY takes his place centered behind the lectern. His chin comes
          up to the bottom of
          the reading platform.
          Men continue to mutter prayers around him. A pair of hands appear
          on his shoulders
          from behind. DANNY looks down at the strange hands. They pull
          him back.
          A foot drags a small riser out from under the lectern.
          Hands push DANNY up onto the riser.

</b>          Booming up on the torah scrolls, still being busily rolled.
          Beyond it, a sea of faces.
          The yad-a molded tin pointer-is thrust into DANNY's hand. The
          non-pointing end has
          a red silken tassel.
          DANNY looks at the bouncing tassel. He looks at the little pointing
          finger which is the
          business end of the yad.
          Men mutter around him, each a different prayer. They dip and
          doven.
          DANNY watches himself point the yad down at the scroll.
          The scroll is a dense swarm of Hebrew letters. DANNY squints.
          One voice separates from the murmurs around him. It chants, insistently,
          in a sotto-voce

<b>          FALSETTO:
</b>
<b>          VOICE
</b>          Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...
          DANNY is still staring at the end of the yad against the parchment
          scroll.
          Someone's hand enters and moves the yad to a different place
          in the text.
          The voice repeats:
          . Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...
          DANNY looks up from the scrolls.
          In the congregation Ronnie Nudell sits hunched-shouldered and
          squished between his
          parents. He returns DANNY's red-rimmed slack-jawed stare.
          The insistent voice:
          . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...
          DANNY looks over.
          From the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him. He looks
          somewhat like Cantor
          Youssele Rosenblatt.

</b>          . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot.. .
          DANNY looks back down at the scroll. A hand enters to tap a pointing
          finger where the
          yad points.
          . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effa-
          DANNY suddenly erupts:

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot. .

<b>          PROMPTER
</b>          Mm-hm.
          DANNY continues to boom out the torah portion. He moves the yad
          along the line of
          letters.
          In the congregation, LARRY and Judith watch. We hear DANNY chanting
          fluently and
          LARRY squeezes the hand Judith has laced through his arm.
          Juith whispers:

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          I'm sorry that... things have been so hard for us...

<b>          LARRY
</b>          It's okay.

<b>          JUDITH
</b>          Sy had so much respect for you, LARRY.

<b>          LATER

          man of late middle age

          his back on the
          congregation so that all may see it.
          DANNY has been ensconced in a highbacked chair upstage on the
          bema.
          His point-of-view of the man holding the torah is close and steeply
          raked. The man is
          sweating. The heavy scrolls vibrate slightly from his effort
          to keep them aloft. As the
          congregation continues to sing he mutters under his breath:

<b>          MAN
</b>          Jesus Christ.. .

<b>          LATER
</b>          DANNY stands behind the left lectern facing Rabbi Nachtner who
          holds a small kiddush
          cup out to him.
          Although Rabbi Nachtner seems to be addressing DANNY, he is projecting
          loudly.

<b>          CONGREGATION
</b>          Amen.
          DANNY, still red-eyed, tries to focus.
          His point-of-view shows the kiddush cup large in the foreground,
          extended toward him
          by the Rabbi beaming above.
          His own hand rises into frame to grasp the kiddush cup.
          The congregation starts Adon Olam.

          leaving sepulchral quiet.
          DANNY, clutching his kiddush cup, hesitantly enters the dim study.
          Minda's elderly
          eastern European gatekeeper closes the door behind him.
          Minda is an old man staring at him from behind a bare desktop.
          His look, eyes
          magnified by thick glasses, is impossible to read.
          DANNY creeps to the chair facing the desk. He gingerly sits on
          the squeaking leather
          upholstery, self-conscious under Minda's stare.
          Minda breathes regularly through his mouth. It is the only sound
          in the room.
          A long beat. The two sit face to face.
          Minda smacks his lips a couple of times, preparing to speak.
          Another beat.

<b>          FINALLY:
</b>
<b>          MINDA
</b>          When the truth is found. To be lies.
          He pauses. He clears his throat.
          At length:
          . And all the hope. Within you dies.
          Another beat. DANNY waits. Minda stares.
          He smacks his lips again.
          . Then what?
          DANNY doesn't answer. It is unclear whether the question was
          directed at him.
          Quiet.

          He nods a couple of times.

          He reaches up and slowly opens his desk drawer. He takes something
          out. He lays it on
          the bare desk and pushes it partway across.
          . Here.
          It is DANNY's radio.

</b>          DANNY is looking across the lot in which orange school busses
          are parked. His head bobs
          in time to the music. His hair whips in the wind. A building
          roar, very deep.

</b>          We hear, very compressed, the beginning of "Somebody to Love."
          DANNY sees a shaggy-haired youth among the milling students.

<b>          DANNY
</b>          Hey! Fagle!
          From behind DANNY, over his shoulder: we see a funnel cloud in
          the middle distance.
          A growing rumble. The tornado is approaching.
          At the first downbeat of its chorus the Jefferson Airplane song
          bumps up full.

          We cut to black, and credits.
