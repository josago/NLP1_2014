               JAFFA, a Jamaican looking fellow in his early 20's, arrives
               at Water World, carrying a dusty cardboard box.

               There are a few workers milling about, setting up the park
               for opening. He passes EDDIE, a 25-something grounds worker
               with Down's Syndrome.

                         Jaffa.

               They do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked
               out some time in the past. JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer
               Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the
               kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's.

               He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD
               player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed
               a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a
               microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works.

               He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it
               is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it
               into the CD player.

               He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he
               pushes the "play" button on the CD player.

               His voice echoes through the park.         "Soak up the Sun" begins
               playing.

<b>       2       EXT EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY                                    2
</b>
               BIG MIKE, the park's owner/manager - a 50-something man who
               is portly and bald, and RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard and
               another GUARD are on the east side of Thunder Bay.

               There is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter
               cover on it. The GUARD is standing there with a garden hose




<b>
</b>                                                                   Page 2 of 81

               holding it so the water goes into Thunder Bay.

               He is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long
               time. We look back at the massive size of the pool and get
               the joke.

               BIG MIKE and RICHARD pull off the winter cover. The GUARD
               turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting BIG MIKE
               wet. They object and he turns back to filling Thunder Bay.
               RICHARD moves the GUARD to a safe distance.

               BIG MIKE blows the dust off of the box at the top of the
               post, and we see it is a large push button. BIG MIKE looks
               at RICHARD who nods "go ahead" and then pushes the button.

               They both draw back as if something big should happen, but
               nothing. They look at each other and BIG MIKE motions for
               RICHARD to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the
               pool.

               RICHARD waves OK, and BIG MIKE pushes the button again. When
               nothing happens, RICHARD whacks the side of the tank with his
               closed fist. Suddenly a huge wave rolls out.

               Nodding his approval, BIG MIKE checks off an item in his
               clipboard.

</b>
               We see people working to open the park. The VAIL PRECISION
               LAWN CHAIR DRILL TEAM dressed in Water World uniforms is
               setting and arranging chairs in time to the music. They
               perform precision maneuvers with the chairs, as if rifles,
               and cross each other in a timed march to the music.

<b>       4       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   FUN HOUSE AREA                      4
</b>
               BIG MIKE is standing under the Fun House structure with a
               clipboard. He is talking to RICHARD.

               After talking to BIG MIKE, RICHARD shakes his head
               affirmatively and walks off. He glances up to the two guards
               above, and grins. BIG MIKE is looking at his clipboard. We
               see quickly the large water tank above is spilling water a
               bit, indicating it is full.

               The water tank spills over BIG MIKE drenching him. He stands
               there still, angry for a moment, then thinks better of it
               shaking his head and smiling, takes his pen and checks OK on
               his wet clipboard for the fun house water tank.

<b>       5       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   FIRST AID SHACK NEAR FUNHOUSE       5
</b>
               Two guards are looking down at BIG MIKE below. One guard
               begins motioning as if guiding a crane into place. The other
               guard has his hand poised on a large switch lever.

               GUARD ONE is gesturing more emphatically now, closing his
               hands to indicate "almost there". He closes his hands, and
               GUARD TWO pulls the lever.

                        I'm sure it won't be so bad. Besides, a

               There are about 40-50 teenagers in various default street
               clothes, shorts and tees mostly. Robbie takes his place in
               line behind an older, taller boy, ALEX, who seems to know
               almost everyone, and has made it his personal mission to
               greet them.

                        There's nothing about our relationship

               ROBBIE and ALEX walk up to yet another line of about 4 or 5
               teens. At the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy are
               behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a
               clipboard list.

               As ROBBIE and ALEX reach the back of the line, TIFFANY, a

               Aokee's is a restaurant near Thunder Bay. It seats about 50
               and is lavishly decorated in a Hawaiian Surf and Ocean motif,
               with surf memorabilia, fish nets, surfboards, and the like.

               AOKEE is a large 375 pound plus apparently Hawaiian man, late
               twenties, early thirties, wearing a purple Hawaiian shirt,
               blue shorts and a white chef's apron that says KISS THE COOK.

               Lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including
               ROBBIE, who is sixth furthest from THE COLONEL. They are all

                         nickname in every way except, of course,
                         your paycheck and employee records.

               THE COLONEL looks over his paperwork.

<b>                                   THE COLONEL    (CONT'D)
</b>                         Let's see, what do we    have? Hmm...yes.
                         OK, first up is Eddie    Cochran. Your
                         grounds crew nickname    will be.....Eddie!

               EDDIE smiles knowingly. This has been his grounds crew
               nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never
               answer to anything else, and THE COLONEL gave up trying.

<b>                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
</b>                         Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here
                         has eight years experience on the grounds
                         crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't
                         anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't
                         faced. Listen to him. Learn from him.
                         Watch what he does. This man is the
                         finest, most conscientious grounds
                         crewman we've ever had.

               EDDIE is beaming with pride now. THE COLONEL pulls a brand
               new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to
               EDDIE. EDDIE shoulders it as if it were a rifle.

               THE COLONEL walks down the line.

<b>                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
</b>                         Let's see...Clark? Hmmm. Your grounds
                         crew nickname will be....Sparky.

               It is all ROBBIE can do not to laugh. THE COLONEL goes on to
               the next kid, SKEETER who is tall, skinny and goofy-looking.
               SKEETER'S eyes are faced forward, but something catches them.
               His eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small
               mosquito. Finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross
               eyed at his own nose.

               THE COLONEL has taken note of this and is following it too.
               SKEETER can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he
               makes a face.

</b>                         Hmmm.....your grounds crew nickname will
                         be.....Skeeter.

               THE COLONEL steps over the cart and gets another new plunger
               and hands it to SKEETER who follows EDDIE's lead.

               Next in line is a short, chubby lad, SNITCH. As THE COLONEL
               approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard.

               THE COLONEL is startled, and SNITCH makes a quick finger
               motion indicating the culprit is SKEETER, next to him.

                         Bradley, is it? OK, Mr. Bradley.....your
                         grounds crew nickname will be Snitch.

               SNITCH shows his dismay with a frown. THE COLONEL has run
               out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of
               last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing.

               He gets one and give it to SNITCH, who looks at it, makes a
               face, and decides not to shoulder it. ROBBIE is so depressed
               he looks like he's about to pass out.

               His worst fears have been realized.    His summer is passing
               before his eyes.

               There's only one more person, a young 14 year-old girl, to go
               before ROBBIE. THE COLONEL addresses her.

                             (thinking)

               Suddenly ALEX bursts onto the scene, and even he, at this
               point, is somewhat out of breath.

                        The Colonel here is very modest. Did you
                        know that he reorganized the entire

                         could pick up in an unsanitised army

                        Okay, yeah thanks. Now, I want go over a
                        few basic things. First of all, make
                        sure you've all filled out your paperwork
                        with personnel, cause nobody gets paid
                        unless they do. Come to think of it, I
                        suppose it's better for me that you don't
                        fill out your paperwork, then I don't
                        have to pay you. I'll make it optional.
                        If you want to get paid, fill out your
                        paperwork.
                            (looking at clipboard)
                        Let's remember, the people who come here
                        are our guests, and your job is to see
                        they have a safe and fun experience here.
                        Let's work together to keep the park
                        clean and safe, and we'll have a great
                        summer together. Now with a few words is
                        our head lifeguard, Richard Thompson.

               Another cheer starts up, smaller this time, which ALEX

               ALEX, then everyone begins applauding. ROBBIE looks at ALEX
               quizzically, ALEX just shrugs. The meeting breaks up.

               Everyone is hurrying around, getting ready for opening day.
               ROBBIE, wearing his new blue Hawaiian shirt, is cutting
               pineapple. AOKEE is busy hovering over everyone, and cooking
               chicken on the grill. ALEX walks in.

                         Alex! You are late. Come on, is opening
                         day!

               ROBBIE finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to AOKEE,
               almost spilling it.

                         You two start setting tables.

               ALEX takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins, and
               points to ROBBIE to grab a box of sugar packets to refill the
               dispensers. ROBBIE grabs it quickly, enthusiastically, but
               loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor.

               At that moment, AUDREY a girl in her teens who works at
               AOKEE'S and is stacking plastic cups on the counter,
               accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground.

               RAMON, a teenage boy who works there is behind the counter.
               He bends over, disappearing, and we hear a crash of pots and
               pans. His head peers up from below the counter sheepishly.

               AOKEE turns from the grill looking at all this, and has a
               worried look, but smiles and shrugs weakly.

               ALEX comes up close next to him at the grill so they can
               talk.

                         No problem.

               ALEX pops a CD out of the rack above the sound system, and
               puts it in the CD player, stopping the standard pastoral
               Hawaiian music that has been playing.

               He turns up the volume some on the amp, and goes over to
               SARAH, a teenage girl working there, and grabs her grass
               skirt by the Velcro, removing it with a Velcro rip.

                         One, two, a one two three.

               The music starts and ALEX, now wearing SARAH's grass skirt,
               launches into his version of the electric slide, Hawaiian
               style.

               EVERYONE ELSE gets the beat and begins working to the music.
               AOKEE is using his spatulas as drum sticks on the overhanging
               kitchen tools.

               RAMON has inverted an empty pot and is beating it conga-drum
               style.

               ROBBIE has picked up the sugar packets and ALEX is dancing
               and quickly (almost casually) tossing silverware/napkin rolls
               to ROBBIE as ROBBIE catches them (at first with some
               difficulty) and puts them on the tables.

               SARAH has re-stacked the cups, and is juggling salt & pepper
               shakers, placing them on the tables. AUDREY chops onions to
               the beat.

               AOKEE has now taken all the chicken off the grill and comes
               out from behind the counter, dancing. The others form a

               As they go by the tables they put on any missing items. They
               get into it more and more, AOKEE especially, swinging his
               huge, 375 pound guy hips.

               another one to the ground.

               There is a loud crash and everyone pauses and looks at AOKEE,
               waiting to see if he gets mad.

               AOKEE looks down at his hip, and makes a puppy-dog face like
               "I didn't know my hips were that big...." Everyone claps,

               The walk up to THE WAVE attraction, where kids are surfing in
               a high-water pressure river/ sheet of water. Surf music
               plays loudly here, and kids are doing all kinds of tricks.
               Some riders are good, some are not, and fall quickly.

               We also see SKEETER and SNITCH, the tall skinny and short
               chubby grounds kids we met earlier. They are cleaning up
               around the exit area of THE WAVE.

                         those guys in line over there?

               WE SEE some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair
               laughing and talking to each other.

                         season passes, and do little more than
                         ride the wave all day long. Some of them
                         get pretty good.

               Alex points up to a fence, behind which some smoke appears to
               be drifting up.

                         not riding the wave. Don't get too close
                         to them.

               WE SEE a pretty girl in line to ride.

                         special secret to this ride.

               With that ALEX walks over to BOB, a guy in his late teens,
               wearing a Security Golf Shirt. He is standing and looking
               off in a different direction.

               WE SEE FRANK push forward on a handle next to him that seems
               to resemble the throttle on a speedboat. The ambient noise
               from the wave is noticeably higher.

               The WAVE BABE jumps into the water with the board.      SKEETER
               and SNITCH are still cleaning near the exit.

                              radio)
                         Watch, and wait....

               THEY LOOK intently at the WAVE BABE, who is pretty good, even
               with the increased water flow. But, after a few deft moves,
               she falls. ALEX looks, and sees what he is looking for.
               ROBBIE smiles.

<b>                                    ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>                         Yesss!

               We look back at the WAVE BABE, but the water is obscuring our
               view. We then see a medium shot of SKEETER and SNITCH. The
               WAVE BABE walks past them carrying a board, but we don't see
               below her waist, the board obscures our view.

               SNITCH sees, and freezes, dumbstruck. SKEETER is looking
               down at the grate where THE WAVE water drains. He reaches
               down and pulls something out, and turns to the WAVE BABE
               walking away.

                             (louder)
                         Hello...excuse me...?

               Finally she turns. We see her, but just a flash of her from
               the back, as the board covers her waist area. She is puzzled
               by this grounds kid.

<b>                                   SKEETER (CONT'D)
</b>                             (holding up the bottom to her
                              swimsuit)
                         Is this yours?

               She looks down behind the board and reacts.     She bites her
               lower lip, winces and nods yes.

               SKEETER hands her her swimsuit, and she looks around and
               backs away towards a towel hanging from the fence nearby.
               SNITCH is still frozen, stunned by what he's just seen, mouth
               wide open. SKEETER waves his hand in front of SNITCH's face.

               No reaction.   He's never seen a naked girl before.

               We're back to ALEX and ROBBIE.

               WE SEE SKEETER and SNITCH walking into the men's room,
               looking suspiciously around.

               SNITCH is filling up a water balloon, while SKEETER is tying
               a piece of fishing line to the hook on the inside of the
               stall door. SKEETER climbs up on top of the stall.

               SNITCH is tying off the water balloon and grabs the other end
               of the fishing line, and ties it to the fill end of the
               balloon. He shuts the stall door, tosses the balloon up to
               SKEETER, who places it strategically on the beam above the
               toilet. SKEETER then jumps down, and they head for the door.

               Eddie Enters. We see EDDIE cautiously checking out the
               restroom. He reaches up over the closed stall door and feels
               gingerly the fishing line. He smiles and shakes his head,
               and heads for the door.

               EDDIE is now pushing his cart and making his way toward the
               MEN's RESTROOM. He stops to talk to two concessions girls
               and show them a magic trick that apparently involves a deck
               of cards, which he pulls from a place on his cart. We see
               him holding the cards so one girl can pick one.

               SKEETER pops his head out and looks around. He sees Eddie in
               the distance about 5 minutes away, and putting a plastic
               liner in a trash can. He nods and disappears into the men's
               room.

               SKEETER and SNITCH appear at the door, look out, and see
               EDDIE finishing his card trick. He presents a card for the

               walk off, they look at each other and shrug.

               SKEETER and SNITCH take off, barely containing their
               laughter. But EDDIE notices them leaving. All of this has
               happened under the watchful though distant eye of ALEX.

               EDDIE goes into the restroom.

               EDDIE exits the restroom and goes to his cart.     At this point
               ALEX and ROBBIE walk up to him.

               Two young women guards, KATIE and AMY are loading kids into

               ROBBIE and ALEX proceed to BIG MIKE's out of frame.

               SUDDENLY in the background we see a tube splashdown from a
               slide and the 7 year-old girl riding in it falls out.

               Realizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and
               begins splashing as if drowning. A guard nearby blows a
               single tweet of her whistle.

               IN SLOW MOTION we see four other guards throughout the area
               turn and react to the whistle. They begin running, BAYWATCH
               style towards the scene.

               Two guards are running and carrying a backboard. They
               converge in another BAYWATCH style slow-mo shot and line up
               along the edge of the splashdown pool.

               One guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in slow
               motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the
               girl.

               At the low end of the jump crouch, however he stops.      WE SEE
               his face in close-up as he says.

               The drowning girl stops splashing wildly, and realizes she
               can indeed stand up. She looks at all the guards lined up,
               smiles sheepishly, and walks out of the pool.

                         too much at first. When you wipe out,
                         your ride is done.

               ALEX is up now, and he grabs the board and jumps in. He is
               pretty good, but not nearly as good as the WAVE BUMS. He
               does a few tricks and wipes out. He gets up and walks up to
               the line to watch ROBBIE.

                         Just ease into it.

               ROBBIE takes the board and looks around. He jumps full force
               onto the wave. It takes him just a moment to get the feel of
               the board, and then he is all over it, making the WAVE BUMS
               look like rookies. Spins, rolls, everything that can be done
               he does. Finally, the guard blows a whistle indicating that
               his time is up.

               They start walking back.

               They stop for a moment to look at Thunder Bay. Just then a
               wave spews out, and kids on tubes are screaming as they
               always do.

                        Mahalo and Aloha. This song is sung on
                        my island for all young people in
                        love...or about to be. Is called E
                        O'Mai, or, You Are Mine.

               AOKEE begins singing the Hawaiian love song, "E O'Mai".      Many
               couples are dancing; it is a slow song.

               ALEX, of course, is a goof. He dances slow, but every once
               in a while executes a deep dip, much to AMY's terror.

               EDDIE is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching,
               longingly, and kind of swaying to the music. A couple of
               girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them.

               He holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing in
               his hands. He also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is
               wearing a tuxedo t-shirt). He reaches behind his back and
               pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quite
               open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them.

               EDDIE smiles weakly, he knows that isn't quite how it was
               supposed to go. The girls appear encouraging, but as they
               leave look at each other and giggle.

               We pick up ROBBIE and KATIE dancing.

                         apparently it's a pretty big deal. Being
                         from Oceanside, you should have a good
                         chance.

                         me. A surfing contest in Colorado.

                            (laughing)
                        My friends back home would never believe
                        it.

               They continue to dance. WE SEE BIG MIKE talking to TIFFANY
               and gesturing broadly. TIFFANY is clearly not agreeing with
               what he is saying. COWBOY is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly she
               throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where
               EDDIE is standing alone, swaying a bit to the music.

               She whispers something in his ear, and EDDIE'S eyes get real
               big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance
               floor. She wraps her arms around EDDIE and they dance, all
               the while glaring at her father.

               EDDIE knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly settles
               in, Big Man on Campus. TIFFANY is taller than he is, so he
               happily puts his head on HER shoulder.

               BIG MIKE looks back at them, not happy with the way it
               happened, but satisfied.

               DOUG FITZGERALD (twenty bucks DOUG) is dancing with a girl
               when ALEX, doing some kind of fancy spin to AMY, bumps into
               him.

               ALEX grabs AMY and swings her into another fancy move that
               leads them away from DOUG.

                        selling some dish soap or something, and
                        they think it will be magical to have
                        two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom
                        on this fantasy set with clouds and
                        everything. They lock this girl and I
                        into a dance studio with a choreographer
                        for two weeks, and then they shoot the
                        commercial.

                         for six months without everyone in the

               manhole cover being removed. ROBBIE bends over the hole and
               hollers "PIPEMAN" and peers in. He shakes his head

               piping and gauges and the like. He peers and sees a head
               with a red scarf, but it moves out of view.  Surf music
               fades.

               There is a constant whine of the pumps. ROBBIE moves further
               in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench,

               She walks off. ROBBIE just stands there. ALEX starts
               walking, then comes back. Finally ALEX pushes him on the
               shoulder.

               WE SEE TIFFANY and ROBBIE again, and TIFFANY is laughing
               loudly at some joke ROBBIE has made.

               ROBBIE jumps in and they drive away. ALEX, AMY and KATIE are
               still standing on the porch of the TIME SHACK, shocked at

               WE SEE ROBBIE and TIFFANY drive out the gate.     We see KATIE
               walk slowly out of the park alone.

               As she is walking, we flash back to scenes of KATIE and

               ROBBIE together, dancing and laughing. This time the dance
               moves to the song of Allison Krause's "New Favorite".

               We take a final look at KATIE with the setting sun at her
               back and see she is crying.

               We see the rising sun behind AOKEE's head as he raises a
               conch shell and blows it like a horn. He is dressed like a
               Hawaiian prince.

               As the shot widens it reveals six males and two females
               dressed in Hawaiian native garb. ROBBIE And ALEX are among
               several drummers with bamboos sticks in their hands that
               provide percussion for the Hawaiian war dance.

</b>                          Aie, noka moka kei kai ke alo.

               The drums begin and the male dancers, carrying spears begin
               the Hawaiian war dance. The drummers sing the Hawaiian folk
               tune "No ka moku Kiakahi Ke Aloha".

               There are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform
               sitting cross-legged behind them, clapping the beat in
               unison.

               The MALE DANCERS circle each other in time to the beat,
               gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading army.
               The war dance progresses until the invading warriors are
               defeated and the folk song ends. At the end, the kids
               sitting behind raise their hand and shout.

               Looking to the south side of the pool, we see about 50
               grounds kids sitting in rows. In our foreground there are
               six large trash cans, with toilet plungers arranged next to
               them, 2 each.

               To our left are a line of six grounds kids in army fatigues
               carrying brooms as if rifles. The lead kid shouts:

               THE DRILL team marches into full view. The grounds kids

               the line of trash cans.

               They allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march
               to the trash cans. They pull out bright blue ski masks, a la
               BLUE MAN GROUP, and pick up the toilet plungers. The lead
               marcher holds his plunger high and shouts.

               like drum routine with the trash cans.

               Two grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding
               steel trash can lids by the handles (with gloves). These
               become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash
               can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as
               the drumstick.

               A competition erupts from the left and right sides of the
               line as they each set a beat and then the other matches.

               Finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the
               beat for an ending flourish.

               They pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the
               kids behind them. They begin to march in place and the seated
               grounds kids clap for the tempo.

               They clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit.

               All is quiet now. WE SEE concessions kids sitting, grounds
               kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see
               lifeguards sitting. Everyone is looking around.

               Suddenly two lifeguards dressed as Roman Soldiers appear with
               horns. They bellow a Roman Call to Action, and two Roman
               drummers lead a column of other lifeguards.





<b>
</b>       Page 63 of 81

               First we see female guards dressed in togas filing in. Behind
               them are six gladiators with swords and shields, marching.

               They are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of
               rose petals. She is throwing them into the path of the next
               group to enter.

               Next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying
               COWBOY, who is sitting up on a First Aid backboard. HE is
               wearing laurel leaves and a toga, he is obviously Cesar. On
               the backboard is also the surfer king trophy.

               They all approach the area in front of the seated guards, and
               rearrange themselves so that COWBOY has a good view of the
               gladiators. The drummers count a cadence that sets the pace
               for a simulated battle between the gladiators.

               The simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are
               on their knees before the three victorious gladiators. The
               victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones,
               and look to COWBOY for a yea or nay.

               COWBOY generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the
               swords are put away. The seated lifeguards all raise their
               fists and shout.

                         Lifeguards! Lifeguards!     Lifeguards!

               The guards holding COWBOY set him down in front of an
               elevated platform that has a microphone..

               COWBOY picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the
               platform. He sets the trophy on a table next to the
               microphone, arranging it carefully.

               We see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the
               wave pool that says "WATER WORLD WELCOMES EMPLOYEE
<b>               OLYMPIANS".
</b>
               COWBOY moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal
               manner and speaks.

               The seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly. We see a
               group of three people, two male and one female, adults we
               will later identify as JUDGES. They nod approvingly and
               write something down on their clipboards. We see BIG MIKE
               near them, smiling broadly.

               We see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the area
               is clear. There are scattered squashed up pieces of white
               paper lying about.

               We look to the south and see that there are three boy/girl
               teams with one of their legs tied together, like a three
               legged race.

               The rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the other
               team member has the broom. A JUDGE triggers a starter pistol
               and they are off.

               The lifeguard team falls almost immediately, and the grounds
               team takes a early lead over the concessions team, who are
               trying to figure the dustpan/broom operation out. The two
               grounds people work tightly together and quickly advance.

               The lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up to
               their first piece of trash. Concessions has figured out the
               dustpan, but are still well behind the grounds kids.

               Finally, the grounds kids win, with concessions up second,
               and lifeguards trailing in third. The judges note the finish
               on their clipboards.

               We see three male participants standing in the shallow end of
               Thunder Bay, One red suit (lifeguard) one blue suit
               (concessions) and one green suit (grounds)

               A JUDGE on the rise to the west of Thunder Bay blows an air
               horn to start the race. They all rush into the bay and begin
               swimming furiously.

               The guard takes the lead quickly, followed not far behind by
               the grounds kid. The concessions kid is working hard and
               splashing a lot but not getting very far.

               As the guard reaches the back wall, he does an underwater
               racing turn and swims back toward the point where they
               started. Right behind him, the smaller grounds kid does the
               same thing.

               As they are returning, they pass the concessions kid, who
               still is splashing a lot but not going fast. After they pass
               him he stops, as he is tired out.

               Momentarily he can't even tread water any more, and a guard
               watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out. The
               swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid, the concessions
               kid never finishes.

               There are three lines set up with several participants. It
               is a relay race, with the baton replaced by a tray full of
               drinks in paper cups, water. The colors indicate again
               concessions, guards and grounds.

               The race is already in full swing, with concessions in the
               lead. The last group of relayers are now getting their
               trays, and concessions is way ahead.

               Everyone is cheering their team on. The final pass is made
               to SARAH who works for AOKEE's. She takes the tray and moves
               gracefully to the final stop. There is a small table on
               which the drinks must be placed.

               She is clearly going to win when she suddenly stops.

               All concessions kids are shocked and plead her to go on.

               She does a nifty and graceful around the back maneuver with
               the tray, proceeds to the table, and sets down the drinks,
               tipping the tray sideways to show no water has been spilled.

               The JUDGES scribble furiously.

               Three picnic tables are set up in front of AOKEE's. WE dolly
               past each one to see that they are cluttered indentically
               with what appears to be the leftovers from lunch for four.
               Behind each table is a team of two guards, concessions and
               grounds kids.

               A JUDGE blows a whistle and we begin by looking at the
               lifeguard team.

               It is a boy and a girl and the girl is not too keen on this.
               They bring a trash can with them and begin gingerly clearing
               the table, acting as if they are afraid to get their hands
               dirty.

               We dolly left to see the concessions team a little ahead of
               the guard team.

               We dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain
               suit with a face shield.

               A tremendous force of water is clearing the table into the
               trash can which the rain-suited grounds kid is holding at
               it's end.

               We dolly further left to see EDDIE in full army fatigues with
               safety goggles on and wearing the biggest super-soaker water
               gun in the history of man.

               The table is quickly cleared, and at the same time washed.
               EDDIE holds up the business end of the Super-Soaker gun and
               blows imaginary smoke from it's barrel, like an old Western
               gunfighter.

               The JUDGES take notes.

               The three different teams are gathered in groups waiting for
               the next challenge. One of each team is in full sweats,
               color coordinated by team.

               ALEX is the one in the sweats for concessions. Slowly the

               down.

               The grounds kid is the littlest guy of all.

               A JUDGE blows a whistle and four members of each team run
               into the water and drag their now soaked sweat suited
               teammate out of the water. They lie them down on a clear
               area and begin CPR.

               The guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them
               blow air into the mouth of their victim, and they roll him
               quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin CPR.
               They are fast and efficient, and clearly expertly trained.

               We move left to see the grounds kids, knowledgeable but
               inexperienced. One girl is using her hands to provide a
               seals over the mouth of her "victim" and another is clumsily
               pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count while
               reading some kind of instruction card..

               We move again to see the concessions kids, who are in
               trouble. ALEX is lying there dying, and they are arguing
               about who has to breathe into his mouth. They form a circle
               over him, pointing and arguing.

               Finally they all just walk off and ALEX is still lying on the
               ground, eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in a
               hilarious death scene.

               The JUDGES take their notes.

               Once again three teams representing the three competing
               factions. Large stainless steel pots are bubbling on three
               propane cooking stands in front of the concession.

               The teams each have three members in cooking aprons, again,
               color coded. One from each team is stirring the team's chili
               while the others watch the JUDGES anxiously.

               Lines are forming in front of each pot, with people in line
               each carrying a paper chili bowl, but holding back, deferring
               to the JUDGES. The JUDGES are each carrying three styro cups
               in which to receive the chili.

               They each get a portion from the guard team and take a sip.
               They smile politely to the cooks, but turn around and spit
               the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible, almost
               as if throwing up. A concessions kid is there with a tray of
               waters, which they quickly take advantage of.

               They move on to the grounds team. They get their portions
               and taste the chili and nod, not bad.

               They take another sip of water to clear their palate and move
               on to the concessions team. The portions are proudly
               scooped.

               They take a taste, smile and take some more.     They huddle for

               Hundreds of people are gathering on bleachers to watch the
               surfing competition.

               A large highway construction type signboard has been erected
               and says "Grounds   93", "Concessions 93" and "Lifeguards

               It is almost a festival atmosphere.     The JUDGES are standing

               in a group, conferring, near a table that has the controls
               for the sign. The sign can be viewed easily from the
               bleachers.

               WE look over to the front of AOKEE's and see AOKEE and ALEX

               ROBBIE picks up his board, and they begin walking toward the

               ROBBIE, COWBOY and MELINDA from grounds, who we met earlier

               One JUDGE explains the rules.

<b>                                   HEAD JUDGE
</b>                             (looking down at clipboard)
                         Alright, here's the deal. You get three
                         tries; three heats. We judge each run
                         and only your high score counts. If you
                         fall you get no score for the run. Your
                         score will be added to the total for your
                         team, and the winner gets the Surfer King
                         Trophy. Any questions?

               They all shake their head no.

<b>                                  HEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)
</b>                        Then let's begin. Grounds is up first.

               MELINDA grabs her board and begins paddling out. The wave
               comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. She
               struggles and falls at the end. She will clearly not be a
               factor. The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the
               grounds score.

               We look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the
               COLONEL and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed.

               COWBOY is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it
               easily. He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out
               at the end. The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row.
               The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now.

               ROBBIE is next. He catches the wave and rides it more
               aggressively than COWBOY, but nearly falls at the end of his
               run. The big screen shows an 8. The concessions kids and
               AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance
               with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner.

               MELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more
               confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and
               ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen
               shows a 5.

               COWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more
               aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear
               a large gasp from the crowd as this happens.

               The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive
               but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen
               shows a 0.

               ROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this
               time not nearly falling at all. The JUDGES nod approvingly
               and confer. The big screen shows a 9. The crowd goes wild,
               especially the concessions kids.

               Melinda begins her final run. She does better than the past
               two, but not significantly. The JUDGES confer and the screen
               shows a 5. The ground kids are very disappointed, they know
               they are out of it now. THE COLONEL shakes MELINDA'S hand
               and thanks her for her efforts.

</b>    Page 74 of 81

               COWBOY gets his wave, and has clearly decided to go back to
               his original style; he rides the wave gracefully, but takes
               no chances.

               He kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile. The guards
               applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the
               JUDGES confer and the screen shows an 8.

               ROBBIE snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but
               loses his balance momentarily. It costs him; the JUDGES
               confer and the screen shows a 7.

               The concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show
               "Grounds   98", "Concessions 102" and "Lifeguards 102".

               EVERYONE is confused, there has never been a tie before. THE
               JUDGES Are flipping through papers, and BIG MIKE steps up to
               the microphone.

<b>                                  BIG MIKE
</b>                            (clearing his throat,
                             flustered)
                        It looks like we have a tie. This has
                        never happened before, but I seem to
                        remember we provided for this possibility
                        in the rules. Hopefully our judges can
                        help us figure out what to do!

               The HEAD JUDGE is reading to the other JUDGES out loud, slaps
               his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike.

<b>                                  HEAD JUDGE
</b>                        Reading from the rules, "...in the event
                        of a tie at the end of three heats in the
                        surf competition, the teams who are tied
                        will participate in a sudden-death surf
                        off. Additional heats will be run until
                        a winner can be declared."
                            (looking up at the crowd)
                        The "Sudden Death" heat will begin in
                        five minutes.

               Everybody cheers...they're going to see some more great
               surfing.

               The JUDGES signal COWBOY and ROBBIE to come over. The head
               JUDGE takes a quarter out of his pocket and points to COWBOY
               to call it. It lands and the JUDGE looks at it. HE points
               to ROBBIE.

                         Actually, that's exactly what I'm
                         thinking. It's the reason we're in a

                         got to do everything I can, or just

                        One time, these tourists from Japan on
                        the beach at La Jolla offered me a
                        hundred bucks to do a full spin at the
                        top of the wave, and then slide down and
                        cut back and do a full back flip. I
                        pulled it off. A friend of mine had a
                        tricks board with just a single fin and
                        foot pockets.

               They place the board on a table. ROBBIE pulls off two small
               pieces of tape and places them on the board.

               PIPEMAN gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins
               removing the two outer fins of the board. He then begins
               looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets.

               This provides a background to the dialog below.

               COWBOY is in the water paddling out to get his wave. It
               comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what has
               gotten him this far; a conservative style that keeps him
               looking good without falling. His ride is similar to the
               last one, but even more graceful and lyrical and he gets a 9.

               ROBBIE appears on the seawall holding his board and looking
               out first at the bay, then at the crowd. His mom, CONNIE
               waves, and he smiles weakly.

               HE sees KATIE and she looks hopeful. She hasn't given up on
               him completely. He smiles at her and gets into the water.

               He begins paddling. It seems to take forever for him to get
               out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally
               arrives.

               He sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises
               his hand to signal he is ready.

               The CONCESSIONS KIDS have started to chant, ROBBIE! ROBBIE!
               The guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to
               the cadence of the chant.

               The wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet
               into the duct tape pockets. He misses one pocket at first,
               then gets it in.

               He rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to

               the top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water.

               On landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down
               it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads
               straight into the wave. At the top he bounces and does a
               complete back flip in slow motion.

               We see the crowd also in slow motion. AOKEE Is covering his
               eyes, he can't watch. ALEX's face is contorted with
               disbelief. Various faces in the crowd are in open-mouthed
               disbelief. THE JUDGES are staring intently, focussed so as
               not to miss anything.

               ROBBIE lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave.      He
               waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted.

               The place goes nuts. No one here has ever seen anything like
               this before. AOKEE and ALEX run into the water and help him
               out. People are still cheering.

               COWBOY knows he's in trouble.

               THE JUDGES confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears,
               and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word
               winner. COWBOY nods in agreement.

               TIFFANY says something to him, and he appears angry.      We can
               only hear part of his response, something like:

                         You did WHAT?

               AOKEE and ALEX lead him up to the grandstand. COWBOY also
               makes his way up there, and we see him talking to BIG MIKE.
               BIG MIKE nods in agreement and COWBOY goes to the mike as the
               crowd settles down.

               and smiling.
