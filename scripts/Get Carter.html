</b>
<b>               EXT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT
</b>
               Framed in the large picture window stands JACK CARTER, 
               alone, looking out at the night. He turns away as the heavy 
               satin curtains close, wiping him from view.

<b>               INT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               A blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One 
               pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the 
               opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some 
               anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual 
               orgy. 

               GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA, 
               is curled up beside him. 

               SID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control, 
               has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother. 

               Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair. 

               Clunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting 
               turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged 
               leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his 
               touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand.

</b>                              (removing the cigar 
                              from his mouth)
                         Bollock naked with his socks still 
                         on?

               He laughs.

<b>                                     SID
</b>                         Ask me?

</b>                         Ask Jack. It's his old stamping 
                         ground.

               Carter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet. Lights 
               and sweet music happen when he opens it. 

               Clunk. The slide changes.

               Still looking at the screen, Gerald continues.

                         North, Jack.

               Jack and Anna look at each other momentarily. There is 
               definitely something between them.

               Sid laughs raucously.  Clunk. The slide changes.

                         someone from London poking his

<b>               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY
</b>
               Express train plunges into a tunnel Blackness. 

<b>               BEGIN TITLES:
</b>
<b>               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY
</b>
               The compartment is full. Jack Carter sits in one corner, 
               reading a Raymond Chandler paperback, Farewell My Lovely.

<b>               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY
</b>
               The train speeds northwards. In the distance the stacks of 
               a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown 
               smoke.

<b>               INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
               Carter steadies himself as he comes along the corridor.

<b>               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY
</b>
               A massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past. Its 
               mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect.

<b>               INT. TRAIN TOILET - DAY
</b>
               Carter tips his head back and dispenses drops into his 
               nose.

<b>               EXT. RAIL TRACK - EVENING
</b>
               The train breaks from another tunnel. Evening light cuts 
               across the track as the train hurtles on.

<b>               INT. TRAIN RESTAURANT CAR - EVENING
</b>
               Carter pours himself a glass of water and takes out a small 
               phial of brown pills. He swallows one.

<b>               EXT. RAIL TRACK - NIGHT
</b>
               A chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the 
               outskirts of the city appear.

<b>               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
               The train moves slowly along the platform and stops. Carter 
               collects his coat and briefcase from the rack.

<b>               EXT. NEWCASTLE STATION - NIGHT
</b>
               The street is fairly deserted.  

               Carter exits with other passengers from the train. He pauses 
               and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite.

<b>               INT. THE LONG BAR - NIGHT
</b>
               A couple of youths are playing records on the juke box. An 
               old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper.  

               Carter enters through the swing door and a weedy BARMAN 
               comes to serve him.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Pint of bitter.

               The barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the 
               beer. Carter snaps his fingers at him.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         In a thin glass.  

               The barman sighs petulantly, transfers the beer into a 
               thin glass and puts it on the counter.

               A telephone rings. The second barman answers it. 

<b>                                     BARMAN
</b>                         Is there a Mr Carter in the room?

</b>                         Yes.

               Carter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the 
               receiver.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Hello?

                              (pause)
                         Why the hell aren't you here?
                              (he lights a 
                              cigarette.)
                         What time?
                              (pause)
                         Is Doreen at the house?
                              (pause)
                         Who's with him then?
                              (pause)
                         When can I see you? Will you be 
                         there tomorrow?
                              (pause)
                         Now listen, Margaret...  

               The line goes dead. Carter hangs up.

<b>               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               A key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards 
               and out through the flap. A moment later, the door opens. 
               Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in 
               a worker's terraced house. He closes the door and climbs 
               the stairs.

<b>               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT 
</b>
               Carter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling 
               wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits 
               an unseen bucket with depressing regularity.

<b>               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a 
               dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a 
               vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the 
               ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking 
               up. They see him and quickly drive off.

               Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's 
               an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories 
               flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of 
               cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He 
               leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.

<b>               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Pitch black.

               An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK 
               CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his 
               skin made-up, like porcelain.

               Carter stands over the coffin. He gently touches his 
               brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face. 
               He exits, turning out the light and closing the door. 

               Darkness returns.

<b>               INT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               The landlady, EDNA GARFOOT, is climbing the stairs. She's 
               well built, sexy, experienced. Carter follows with his 
               baggage. He watches her appreciatively from behind.

                         Her husband docks tomorrow, does 
                         he?

<b>               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               The door opens and the light goes on. It's a big room 
               overlooking the road, furnished cheaply but comfortably. 

               Edna and Carter enter, talking. 

<b>                                     EDNA

                         out.) I'll pay you for tonight as 
                         well.

               Carter gives her the money.

                         I'll bet this one's seen some 
                         action.

               Carter smiles and looks straight at her. Edna returns his 
               look, dead pan.

               Carter moves around the coffin as he shaves. His electric 
               razor is plugged into the lamp above his dead brother.

               The coffin lid is being screwed down.  

               Carter stirs a cup of instant coffee while watching the 
               undertakers at work.

<b>               INT. HEARSE - DAY
</b>
               The hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses. A 
               youthful UNDERTAKER is minding it. He turns and looks 
               through the back window as a young girl walks up the street. 

               DOREEN CARTER is sixteen and, like most girls of her age, 
               tries to look older. She wears all the right gear but it's 
               cheap and doesn't fit properly. Her long hair is lank.  
               There's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance. 
               The young undertaker watches as she enters Frank's house.

<b>               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The door opens slowly. Doreen stands there looking at the 
               coffin. Carter sees her.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Doreen?  

               She seems mesmerized by what's going on.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         All right, are you?  

               Doreen doesn 't answer.

</b>                         Been staying with a friend?  

               Doreen nods. The undertaker coughs and thrusts another 
               screw into the coffin.

<b>                                     CARTER

<b>               INT. HEARSE - DAY
</b>
               The young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to 
               the radio. In the driving mirror he sees the Land Rover 
               moving slowly tip the road. It stops by the house. Two men 
               suss the scene and drive off.

</b>                         Yes.

               Carter and Doreen look at each other awkwardly.

               Doreen looks at him nervously, shakes her head and fumbles 
               in her bag for a cigarette.

               Carter continues, slightly indignant.

                         Your dad would have wanted it.  

               The undertaker puts the final screw in.

               The undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow 
               staircase into the street. Outside Carter and Doreen wait 
               with two men. EDDIE APPLEYARD, a middle-aged man, is wearing 
               a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie. KEITH LACEY is a

               Through the windscreen of the following limousine Carter 
               can see his brother's coffin in the hearse as it moves 
               slowly through the streets of the city. Sitting in front 
               on fold-out seats are Eddie and Keith.

               As the cortege drives into the crematorium, it passes the 
               Land Rover parked outside. The same two men who passed 
               Frank's house are in it. A long and expensive-looking 
               funeral cortege passes out as they move up the driveway.

<b>               INT. CREMATORIUM - DAY
</b>
               Carter, Doreen, Eddie and Keith are in the front pews facing 
               the catafalque on which Frank's coffin rests. The vicar is 
               already midway through the solemn words of the 'committal' 
               when a woman enters. The clunk of her high heels cuts 
               through the silence. Everybody looks round.

               Doreen nods. Frank's coffin sinks out of sight.

<b>               INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
               Two men in long grey coats wait in silence. The coffin 
               appears. Expertly, they take it and swing it on to a 
               trolley. They push it up the wide corridor towards the 
               furnace. One of the men starts whistling cheerfully.

<b>               EXT. CREMATORIUM - DAY

               MARGARET is thirtyish, blonde, attractive in a tarty kind 
               of way.  Her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap 
               pair of sunglasses. She walks quickly away, down the 
               cloisters, past the memorial tablets and urns.  

               Carter comes out of the chapel and sees her.

               Margaret stops and looks round. Carter joins her.  I thought

               They face each other in silence. Margaret looks past Carter 
               and sees Doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters. 
               She turns away and starts walking slowly. Carter moves 
               with her.  Margaret continues nervously.

               Carter, Doreen, Keith and Eddie are sitting alone. Their 
               table is already covered with glasses. Doreen appears to 
               be slightly drunk on Babycham, Eddie on whisky and Keith 
               on beer. Carter is stone-cold sober.

                         Hell, we worked together every day

                         He was leader of our gang. He'll

<b>               EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY
</b>
               The rain has just stopped. Bookies and punters lower their 
               umbrellas. Horses thunder towards the finishing post. Turf 
               flies in all directions as the jockeys whip their mounts 
               in a last desperate effort and the crowd roars.

<b>               EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
</b>
               Albert Swift is standing by a bookmaker's marking bis race 
               card with a biro. A hot dog is sticking out of his mouth, 
               like a cigar. A man of about thirty-five, be appears much 
               older, probably from an excess of booze and women. He looks 
               up, and his mouth drops open, the hot dog falling to the 
               ground. He has seen Carter.

<b>               EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
</b>
               Carter is pushing his way along the line of bookies, all 
               the time looking about him. The track loudspeaker announces 
               the winner of the last race.

<b>               EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY
</b>
               Albert pales. He holds his race card in front of his face 
               and disappears into the crowd. As he moves off, his foot 
               steps on the hot dog and tomato ketchup oozes out.

<b>               EXT. TRACK SADDLING ENCLOSURE - DAY
</b>
               Carter stands alone, casting an eye over the punters. His 
               eyes rest on someone the other side of the saddling ring 
               ERIC PAICE.  Dressed in a grey chauffeur's uniform, cap, 
               dark glasses and gloves, he is standing close to three 
               well-heeled-looking men with binoculars and shooting sticks.

               Horses for the next race are being led around the enclosure.  
               Carter approaches from behind. He looks at Eric closely 
               before speaking.

               Starting gates slam open and the horses leap out.

<b>               INT. HIRE CAR - AFTERNOON
</b>
               Carter is driving along a country road. Ahead, two cars 
               are between him and a Cadillac with dark-tinted windows. 
               The Cadillac turns on to a minor road. Carter follows.

<b>               INT. CADILLAC - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               Eric Paice is driving. In the back sit the three men seen 
               with him at the race track. The drinks compartment is open 
               and they are helping themselves to champagne. Racing results 
               come over the car radio.

<b>               INT. HIRE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               Carter follows the Cadillac at a safe distance. It turns 
               into a driveway. Carter slows down and reads a sign by the 
               entrance: The Heights. 

               He drives on and parks.

<b>               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               Carter comes through a wooded area. He pauses by a lake, 
               now overgrown with weeds. A big man stands tossing stones 
               into the water. Carter silently picks up a dead branch 
               then runs at the man. Carter whacks him on the head and he 
               collapses unconscious into the lake. Carter moves on towards 
               the house. MARTY and RAY the two men previously seen in 
               the Land Rover, are playing with an Alsatian on the spacious 
               lawn fronting the house. It's a Victorian building 
               surrounded by acres of woodland.

               Carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door. 
               One of the men notices and shouts after him.

<b>               INT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               Carter runs into the house and slips into a small service 
               room. Ray and then Marty charge inside but miss seeing 
               Carter.

<b>               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               A game of poker is in progress. Seated around the table 
               are the three men with Eric at the race track. With them 
               is an elegant man, CYRIL KINNEAR. On the sofa are GLENDA, 
               a sexy-looking young woman, and Eric Paice.

               Ray bursts in.

               Eric jumps up.

               Carter walks past Ray, blowing him a kiss.

               Kinnear watches with some amusement.

               Carter looks at Eric.

</b>                         Yes, I can see your problem, Mr

               Ray closes the door behind him.

               Glenda brings Carter his Scotch. He looks at her as she 
               sits beside him.

               One of the three men sitting around the table with Kinnear 
               gets impatient. PETER, LES AND HARRY are well-heeled, middle-
               aged, northern businessmen.

                         lot of money with them. Glenda, 
                         you don't offer a man like Jack a 
                         drink in those piddling little

                              cards.)

               Harry keeps a cold, wary eye on him.

               Harry looks at his cards. Glenda tucks her legs up, making 
               sure that Carter gets an eyeful.

               Carter looks back at the table. Kinnear pushes in some 
               money.

               Glenda speaks, but this time Carter keeps his eyes on the

               Huge metal claw catches hold of an old car and lifts it

               A big, busty pub singer is performing on the small stage. 
               A trio on her right plays a good, grinding, up-tempo number.  

               Carter comes through the door. He pushes his way through 
               the packed drunken crowd to the bar. Keith serves him.

               Carter watches the singer. The customers cheer and whistle.  
               Keith returns with the Scotch. He looks nervously around 
               and speaks to Carter quietly.

               Carter makes for the door. The singer is now moving through 
               the tables. She pauses to give some man a kiss. Everybody 
               cheers.

               The woman sitting with the man snaps. She picks up his 
               glass of beer and throws it over the singer; then grabs 
               her hair and pulls her to the ground.

               Carter stops to watch. The two women roll on the floor, 
               punching and scratching.

               It's a cosy room. Carter is on the telephone. EDNA sits in 
               a rocking chair.

                         you right now...

               Edna turns towards him. Carter fixes her with his eyes. 
               Edna rocks herself gently. Carter continues softly.

               Anna is lying full-length on the bed.

               Anna's hand caresses the inside of her leg. Her head rolls 
               from side to side slowly. She's breathing heavily.

               CROSS-CUT between Edna's head rocking backwards and forwards 
               and Anna's head moving from side to side.

               Suddenly the door opens and Gerald comes in. He sees Anna

               Carter replaces the receiver. He still holds Edna's eyes. 
               She rocks to and fro. The rocker creaks.

               The front door bell breaks the mood.

               Carter opens the door. Keith is outside. He's sweating. 
               His tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his 
               suit is covered with dirt.

               Carter pulls Keith inside and turns out the light. 

               A Ford Zodiac comes along the road. It stops. Four faces 
               peer into the darkness where they're standing. Nobody gets 
               out. The back window winds down. Thorpe's nervous voice 
               floats out.

                         What you want to tell me, Thorpey?

               Thorpe holds out his hand.

               One of the men inside mutters.

               Carter tears the ticket in half and drops it in the gutter.

               The front passenger door starts to open. Carter grabs it 
               and pulls it wide open. With all his force, he slams it 
               against the man as he gets out. The window shatters over 
               his head. Blood spurts everywhere.  The driver panics. He 
               accelerates away as the man in the back is getting out. 
               His foot is trapped in a safety belt. He's upended and 
               dragged along the tarmac, his head dangerously close to 
               the back wheel. His yells make the driver brake. In the 
               confusion Thorpe escapes from the car and makes off. Carter 
               spots him and begins to run.

                         Thorpe!

               Thorpe turns into the main road. He makes for the dance 
               hall and disappears inside. Carter follows.

               The dance floor is full, mainly with miniskirted girls, 
               their handbags at their feet. A rock band play mechanical 
               music to match the dancing.

               Thorpe vanishes into the crowd circling the floor. Carter 
               arrives. He scans the place, then sees Thorpe as he 
               disappears down into the gents' lavatory.

               Carter enters. There's no sign of Thorpe. He checks the 
               cubicles until he finds the one that's occupied, then goes 
               into the next one. He climbs on the seat and looks over 
               the partition. Thorpe is sitting down looking at the door. 
               Carter quietly leans across and pulls the chain. Thorpe 
               jumps up, terrified.

               Keith kicks broken glass into the gutter while he waits. 
               Edna's next-door neighbour, an OLD WOMAN, watches. Carter

</b>                         Well now, Thorpey. It seems I've 
                         got a secret benefactor.
                              (He moves into the 
                              room and opens his 
                              briefcase, which 
                              is lying on the 
                              bed.)
                         It's nice to know that. Isn't it, 
                         Keith?
                              (He takes out a 
                              bottle of whisky.)
                         There's only one trouble, I don't 
                         know who to thank.

               Thorpe looks longingly at the bottle of Scotch. Suddenly 
               Carter punches him hard in the stomach. He grunts and 
               collapses into a chair.

</b>                         Now, I want to know who it is, 
                         Thorpey.

               Carter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues 
               wearily.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         All right. If you like, Thorpey, 
                         we'll stop mucking about.  Somebody 
                         doesn't want me poking my nose 
                         into something and I happen to 
                         know what that something is.
                              (pause)
                         Now stand up.

               Thorpe looks at him, terrified. Slowly he stands. Carter 
               grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure. Thorpe 
               screams.

<b>                                     CARTER

</b>                         Yes you can.

               Carter applies more pressure. Thorpe screams.

<b>                                     THORPE
</b>                         No, don't Jack, don't.

                         Brumby!

               Carter gives him a final squeeze and lets go. Thorpe groans 
               and slips to the floor, doubled up in agony.

                         (pause)
                         And quickly.

               There's a knock on the door. Carter lets in Edna, who is 
               carrying the teatray.

               Carter laughs and closes the door.

<b>               EXT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT
</b>
               It's a large, new, ranch-style house, set back from the 
               road. The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare, 
               with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well, 
               porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. Fairy lights hang 
               over everything.

               There's a party going on. Lights are on in every room and 
               the rock music is loud. The drive is lined with sports 
               cars.

               Carter parks and gets out.

               Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily 
               pond.  There, he promptly throws up.

               Carter watches from behind a tree.

               His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the 
               drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out.

               CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably 
               dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad.

               MRS BRUMBY cowers in the passenger seat.

</b>                         Now, Cliff, don't get mad.

</b>                         Cliff ...

               Brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. A 
               young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a 
               latecomer, is stunned to see who it is.

<b>                                     SANDRA
</b>                         I wasn't expecting you until three

                         few friends back for coffee, is 
                         it?

               Brumby pushes past her into the house.

                         furniture, drinking my bloody 
                         booze...

               The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers 
               out through the side door

<b>                                     BRUMBY
</b>                         ... spewing over my fucking 
                         goldfish.

               He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him 
               face-down into the lily pond.

               Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As 
               she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears 
               at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers.

               Brumby throws the boy out.

                              the house.)
                         Sandra!

               Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby 
               passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a 
               bedroom.

               Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the 
               row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in.

<b>               INT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT

               Carter passes silently through the hall into the large 
               sitting room. Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair. 

               Brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs.

               Mrs Brumby looks at her watch irritably.

               Mrs Brumby is uncertain what to do. Carter sits in an 
               armchair to make his point. She leaves. A moment later 
               Brumby storms into the room.

               Brumby looks confused.

               Carter moves to the door.

               Brumby moves between him and the door.

                         and out my house in the middle of 
                         the night.

               Carter again makes to leave. Brumby stops him.

                         time job. Now behave yourself.

               Brumby swings at him. Carter moves away from the punch, 
               then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck.  
               Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt.

               Carter walks into the hall and out of the front door.

               Carter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place. He 
               finds the front door unlocked.

<b>               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               Carter enters cautiously. There is no sound. He closes the 
               door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs. Still 
               there is no sound. He waits. A sudden rustle attracts his 
               attention. Quietly, he moves to the sitting-room door.

<b>               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Carter switches on the light. Edna is pressed against the 
               far wall, holding a poker. Her dress is torn and her hair 
               dishevelled. When she sees Carter, she sighs with relief.

                         No.

               Carter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap. 
               Edna looks at her torn dress.

               Carter puts the glass on the table.

               Carter takes out his phial of pills.

               Carter swallows a pill.

                         away.

               Carter shrugs his shoulders.

               Edna rubs her wrists.

               Carter takes hold of her torn blouse and rips it open. She 
               is wearing purple underwear.

<b>               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               It's Sunday morning. A girls' marching band rehearses on 
               the wasteground in front of the terraced houses. The Pelaw 
               Hussars march back and forth carrying their proud banner, 
               led by the drum majorette.

<b>               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Above the bed hangs a sign 'What would Jesus say?' In the 
               bed lie Carter and Edna. The distant sound of the marching 
               band helps them surface.

               The Pelaw Hussars keep on marching. The back of their banner 
               a stirring motto For Youth and Valour.

               He puts his arm around her and moves on top.

               As the band executes another movement, a red Jaguar slides 
               to a halt outside Edna's house. Two men get out. PETER the 
               Dutchman and CON MCCARTY are definitely not local lads. 
               They look, and are, lethal. They try Edna's front door. It 
               opens.

<b>               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

                         Do you eat breakfast? 

               Edna laughs. They start to make love. Gently. Below the 
               undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside 
               it, Carter's shotgun. Beyond is the bedroom door. It opens 
               slowly and the two men enter. Only their legs are visible.

               Carter is off the bed, and Edna, in a flash. Edna screams 
               and tries to stop the bedclothes following Carter on to 
               the floor. Peter and Con stand beside the bed smiling. 
               Peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide-
               bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf. His hair is 
               bleached blond. Con is more traditional, more butch. He's 
               in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie. Both are in their 
               thirties.

               Carter's hand runs over the carpet. It's going towards the 
               chamber pot instead of the gun.

               Carter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on 
               towards the gun.

               Then Carter comes out, shotgun held across his chest.

                         on.

               The old woman next door chooses that moment to come out 
               for her milk. As she straightens up, she sees Carter. The 
               bottle flies from her hand and smashes on her doorstep. 
               Carter, never taking his eyes off Peter and Con, slowly 
               backs into the house.

<b>               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
               Carter watches from the window as he pulls on his jacket. 
               The gun lies across the armchair. Outside, he can see Peter 
               and Con talking by the Jaguar. Con exits.

               Edna, now in her dressing gown, enters.

</b>                         I don't want to get rough, do I?  

               Carter picks up the gun. He hands Edna, bis case and the 
               casket.

<b>               INT. REAR OF BOARDING HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               Edna comes out of the back gate into an alley, carrying 
               the casket and case. Con emerges from his hiding place 
               holding a handgun.

               Carter appears from the gate next door, covering Con with 
               the shotgun.

               He takes Con's handgun and signals him to go into Edna's 
               yard.

<b>                                     CARTER

                              (He points the gun 
                              at the coalshed.)
                         Open that door.

               Con unbolts the door.

</b>                         And go inside.

               Con goes in. Carter closes and bolts the door. He moves 
               quickly back to Edna and the car.

<b>                                     EDNA

               Carter jumps into the car.

               The car roars off.

<b>               EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY
</b>
               Washing hangs behind each house as far as the eye can see. 
               Carter drives full tilt through it, collecting towels and 
               sheets on the windscreen.

<b>               EXT. EDNA'S YARD - DAY
</b>
               The coalhouse door is getting a terrible battering. It 
               finally gives and Con bursts out. He runs into the alley, 
               following after Carter.

<b>               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE FRONT - DAY
</b>
               Carter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to 
               the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the 
               Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he 
               scarpers for the pavement.  Carter hits the Jaguar's door 
               at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to 
               the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he 
               is out of sight.

               Con comes running. Peter is looking at the damage.

               Con sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased.

<b>               EXT. BACK STREET - DAY
</b>
               Carter pulls up outside a house and gets out. He takes the 
               washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected 
               garden.

<b>               EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

               Carter presses the bell. The door's opened by a young man, 
<b>               SHAMIR.

               No answer. Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall.

<b>               INT. KEITH'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Carter enters and closes the door. Keith is in a had way, 
               his face like a piece of raw steak. He is lying on a bed, 
               still in the clothes of the night before.

<b>                                     CARTER

               Keith lifts his head painfully from the pillow.

                              to the pillow.)
                         You bastard. You knew they'd come 
                         back.

                         Does Albert Swift still live over 
                         the ferry?

</b>                         Oh yes? How?  

               Carter takes out of his wad of money. Keith's bloodshot 
               eyes watch him through the surrounding puff of flesh.

<b>                                     KEITH

                         course in karate.  

               He throws some money on the bed. Keith tries to kick it 
               off, but it's too painful. He clutches his testicles.

<b>                                     KEITH

                         was bloody well right.

               Carter turns to leave.  Keith continues, crying and angry.

                         you?  

               Carter shuts the door, leaving Keith shouting after him.

                         if the kid was his.

               He falls back on to the bed, crying out in pain.

<b>               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY
</b>
               A wide road runs alongside the Tyne. It passes below the 
               vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city. A 
               carpark lies at the foot of the 'Iron Bridge'. Carter pulls 
               up and parks. He gets out and moves quickly.

<b>               EXT. THE IRON BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
               The bridge is a, massive structure. The traffic lanes are 
               flanked each side by pedestrian walkways. It is here that 
               Carter and Margaret have arranged to meet.

                         it wouldn't work. Dave would have

                         He followed me home and kicked up 
                         a stink in the street,
                              (pause)
                         I had to tell Frank I couldn't see 
                         him any more. It was getting too 
                         dodgy. That was on Sunday.
                              (She stops and looks 
                              over the bridge.)
                         He said he'd kill himself. I was 
                         frightened what you might do.

               They look at each other for a moment. Carter shakes his 
               head. He gently takes the sunglasses from Margaret's face 
               and folds them up.

                         back to this craphole was to find 
                         out who did it. And I won't leave 
                         until I do. You understand?

               Behind Carter Peter's Jaguar comes slowly along the bridge.  
               It stops. The passenger side is a gaping hole.

               Carter swings round to see them, then swings angrily back 
               to Margaret.

               He smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out. 
               The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the 
               pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get 
               to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans 
               out, his usual cheery self.

               And with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated 
               roof. Con jumps out of the Jaguar.

               Carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown 
               steps leading down to the river road, where his car is 
               parked. He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to 
               a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives 
               chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off.

<b>               EXT. RIVER ROAD - DAY

               Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind.  
               He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see 
               his parked car.   

               As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the 
               hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car.

               A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars 
               into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him 
               just before the Jaguar and slows down.

               Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down, 
               so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off.

               The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming 
               Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing 
               the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre.

               Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at 
               the top of the hill.

               Every movement Glenda makes is sexually charged manual 
               gear changes, steering, even braking. Carter can't take 
               his eyes off her.

               Glenda really puts her foot down. The car hurtles around

               It's one large empty concrete box with big picture windows 
               all the way round. Wires are hanging from the ceiling and 
               walls where the lights will eventually be fixed.

               A tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting 
               sun. He is just a silhouette.

               Carter and Glenda enter and walk towards the man. The 
               silhouette turns as he nears it. It's Brumby.

</b>                         Last night, after you'd gone, I 
                         did a little bit of asking around. 
                         Seeing as you weren't very 
                         forthcoming,
                              (pause)
                         It seems that you are concerned 
                         about the death of your brother?  
                         (pause) I got to thinking it would 
                         be nice if the bloke you were after 
                         was the same bloke I wanted off my 
                         back,
                              (pause)
                         You know my life. Machines. The 
                         arcades. Nice business. Looks after 
                         itself. People put money in. I 
                         take it out. Not much rough stuff. 
                         It's a business that makes me very 
                         happy. But recently, I've had a 
                         spot of bother,
                              (pause)
                         One of my lads gets a bit over-
                         anxious and flogs some machines in 
                         a club that's already got some. 
                         The upshot is I've had to eat shit 
                         and stop flogging my machines to 
                         other clubs.
                              (pause)
                         So far as I'm concerned, that's 
                         it. Apparently not. These people 
                         I've offended get the idea that it 
                         would be good to take over my whole 
                         outfit,
                              (pause)
                         So I'm worried. I can't fight them 
                         — I haven't that kind of set-up. 
                         But I've got to fix them before 
                         they fix me. Trouble is, if I try 
                         and they find out, I'm dead.

               Glenda sits up sharply.

               Glenda pushes him away and gets out of the bed.

               Glenda leaves for the bathroom. Carter, curious, looks at 
               the film projector. It's loaded. He switches it on. A beam 
               of light hits the opposite wall. He settles down to watch 
               the film. The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked 
               on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'.  A zoom back 
               reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk. This is 
               followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school 
               uniform, waiting at a bus stop. A car approaches and stops. 
               A woman driver offers the girl a lift. The woman is 
               Margaret. The identity of the girl not revealed.

               Glenda is in the bath. Lots of foam. The hot water is still 
               running.  She's smoking. She leans forward, turning off 
               the tap.

<b>               INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
               Carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft 
               porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him.

               The schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off. 
               The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes 
               in with the girl. Her school hat still hides her identity. 
               Glenda is there to greet them.

               The girl is very awkward. Glenda tries to make her relax, 
               sitting her down and showing her a magazine.

               Glenda brings her into a bedroom. She takes her own top 
               off and goes to do the same with the girl. She takes her 
               hat off. A close-up shows that it is Doreen.

               Carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in 
               the film.  Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock 
               at what she sees. She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, 
               eventually rolling off the bed.

               The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar 
               comes in.

               Carter sits up. It's Albert Swift.

               Albert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves.  
               Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the 
               two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his 
               prize Doreen.  Carter watches.

               Doreen bites her nails and looks terrified. Reflected in 
               the mirror behind Carter is the image of Albert taking off 
               his trousers. The reel runs out and flaps like a fish. 
               Carter doesn't move. Tears form in his eyes. He looks old 
               and defeated. His is a wasted life. Then the anger that 
               drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes.

               Carter, now dressed, moves slowly towards her in the bath.

                         about?

               Carter's fury bursts. He's out of control. He seizes Glenda 
               and plunges her under the bathwater, holding her there.

</b>                         You're a lying bitch.

               Carter lifts her up, out of the water. She is spluttering, 
               nearly drowned.

                         And her father was my brother. And 
                         he was murdered last Sunday. Now 
                         get up and get dressed.

               He pushes her ahead of him.

               Carter manhandles Glenda towards her Sunbeam. He opens the

               Glenda climbs in and he slams the boot shut. The car

               Carter parks the sports car as the ferry docks. He moves

<b>               INT. CAFE - DAY

               A girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea. The

               The girl is numb with fear, unable to answer. Carter grabs 
               her by the throat.

               The girl is frozen with terror. He lets go as suddenly as 
               he grabbed her.

               Carter walks fast. There's the sound of a phone being 
               dialled. It's the GIRL in the cafe.

               Carter reaches the front of a betting shop. He walks in.

<b>               INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY

               Carter closes the door. Race results and odds are coming 
               over the Tannoy. He moves into the shop until he reaches 
               ALBERT SWIFT. Albert is making out a betting slip and 
               doesn't see him.

               Carter sees a door at the back. There's a sign for the 
               toilets.

<b>                                     CARTER

               This time it clicks. Albert moves to the door and Carter 
               follows.

               Carter turns to close the door. Albert runs for it. He 
               reaches the high double-gate at the end. It's locked and 
               he tries to climb it. No luck. Carter easily pulls him 
               down. Albert faces him.

</b>                         Nothing. What could I do?

</b>                         Did Eric know that Frank was my 
                         brother?

<b>                                     ALBERT
</b>                         Yes. I told him.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         What did he say?

<b>                                     ALBERT
</b>                         'Good.'

               Albert draws deeply on his cigarette.

               They drove Frank away in a car.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Is that all there is?

               Albert nods.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Then that's it, Albert.

               Carter takes something from his pocket. There's a loud 
               click.  It's a. knife.

<b>                                     ALBERT
</b>                         Jack, for Christ's sake ...

               He falls to his knees.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         You knew what I'd do.

<b>                                     ALBERT
</b>                              (crying)
                         Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't 
                         kill him.

               Carter drives the knife into him with all his might.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         I know you didn't kill him.
                              (and again.)
                         I know you didn't.

               A ship's horn calls mournfully from the harbour. Albert 
               leans back. Blood seeps from his chest. He pitches forward, 
               twitches, and is dead.

<b>               INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY
</b>
               Carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to 
               the street. A blind man is at the counter placing a bet.

<b>               EXT. JETTY - TYNE FERRY - DAY
</b>
               The Sunbeam waits in the car park. Eric, Con and Peter 
               arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it. They go down 
               the gangplank to the floating jetty. A ferry is chugging 
               across the water.

<b>               INT. FERRY - DAY
</b>
               Carter sits, watching the other passengers. A mother and 
               two young children take his attention. His look is tinted 
               with regret even remorse.

<b>               EXT. JETTY - DAY
</b>
               As the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up 
               to the rail. The passengers disembark, leaving Carter 
               standing alone.  He's holding Con's handgun.

               Eric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters. 
               Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter 
               from under his coat, cocks it and fires. Too late. Carter 
               is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure. Eric 
               shouts.

<b>                                     ERIC
</b>                         No shooters. Cyril said no shooters,

               Carter is listening to all this.

                         about all day?

               Eric laughs.

</b>                         You're finished, Jack. You know

               Eric laughs.

<b>                                     ERIC
</b>                         Oh, you've still got your sense of

                         he, Con? Then Peter talked to him.

<b>                                     PETER
</b>                         Didn't even say goodbye. Just asked 
                         us to take you back - alive.

<b>                                     ERIC
</b>                         He's probably talking to her right 
                         now. Are you still going to fancy 
                         her when Gerald's finished with 
                         her face?

               Carter shows no emotion. Or are his eyes just that bit 
               sadder?  Peter lets rip again. Another window is shattered. 
               Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry.  

               Carter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the 
               ferry's superstructure to the roof. By the time he heaves 
               himself into position, Carter is waiting.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Stay where you are, Peter.

               Peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even 
               raise his shooter.

<b>                                     PETER
</b>                              (screaming)
                         Don't.

               There's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he 
               cold-bloodedly shoots. Peter is blown away. By the time he 
               hits the deck, he's dead.  

               Con and Eric panic. They run up the gangplank, safely out 
               of range.

<b>                                     ERIC
</b>                         Carter, your car needs a wash.

               Eric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the 
               Sunbeam into the water. Two hits and the task is done.  
               Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around 
               the sinking car.

               Carter watches impassively.

               Carter's hire car corners at speed into the high-rise

               The sound of a car screeching up the ramps interrupts him.

               Brumby comes out to the top tier. On the floor below, 
               Carter, unseen by Brumby, has parked and is now making for 
               the concrete spiral staircase.

<b>               EXT. STAIRCASE - DAY

               Brumby pounds down to the first level. Carter comes around

               Carter hangs up. He takes a can of film from his pocket 
               and slips it into a large envelope.  At the counter two 
               women are talking.

               The envelope is passed across to the post office assistant. 
               It is addressed to Vice Squad, Scotland Yard, London Sw1.

               The huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man-made 
               island in the middle of the river.

               On top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse, from 
               which a man operates the bridge. Carter climbs the outside 
               ladder. A man waits for him at the top.

               The man hands him a small cloth package. Carter opens it. 
               Inside is heroin and a hypodermic. He wraps it up again 
               and hands over an envelope. The man checks the money as 
               Carter disappears down the outside ladder.

<b>               INT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT

               The hall is crowded. The compere calls the numbers. The 
               atmosphere is tense as the audience look at their cards. 
               Someone calls, 'Bingo.' A buzz goes round the hall as 
               everybody starts talking again.

               Carter enters, surveying the audience. Eventually, his 
               eyes alight on the person he's been looking for Margaret. 
               She's involved with a woman friend and doesn't see him. 

               The next game starts up.

<b>               EXT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT

               Crowds of people come pouring out. It's the end of the 
               evening's entertainment. Margaret walks out with her friend. 
               Carter follows them and turns up a side street.

<b>               EXT. STEPS LEADING TO BACK STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               The place is deserted. Margaret and her friend descend the 
               steps. The clop of their high heels is the only sound. 
               Carter follows discreetly. At the bottom, Margaret and her 
               friend chat for a moment and part.

               Carter follows Margaret.

<b>               EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

               The clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance. She 
               appears. Carter is following behind. He slips into another 
               dark alley to get ahead of her. As she reaches her home 
               Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar. It's holding 
               Con's handgun.

               Different things are obviously going on in different rooms 
               in the house. Dancing in one room, blue movies in another,

                         Right.

               Carter hangs up. He pushes Margaret towards the car.

               The noise of the wild party is heard off. Eric comes into 
               the room.

               Headlights, through the thick trees, as Carter's car comes 
               bouncing over rough ground.

               Carter stops in a clearing and leaves his headlights on. 
               He turns to Margaret.

               Carter and Margaret get out. They appear in the beam of 
               the headlights and move further into the wood.

<b>               EXT. WOOD - NIGHT

               Carter and Margaret stop.

               Margaret is confused.  Take your clothes off.  Margaret 
               does just that: coat, blouse, skin. She goes to remove her 
               knickers.

                         Lie down.

               Again she obeys.

               He kneels on her, pinning her arms with his knees, then 
               stuffs a gag in her mouth.

               He takes out the hypodermic, places it against her arm, 
               and injects the heroin into her. She struggles, her eyes 
               moving frantically about. She screams, but its muffled by 
               the gag.  Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under.  
               Carter removes the gag. He stands, picks her up and walks 
               into the darkness with Margaret in his arms.

               Kinnear is alone, speaking on the telephone quietly. The

<b>               INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A bedside light is on. A man in bed is listening on the 
               phone.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Yes.

               He taps his cigarette against the ashtray. On his middle 
               finger is a large ring with the initial 'J' on it. He 
               listens until the line goes dead.

               The woman beside him stirs. He stubs out the cigarette and 
               switches off the light. Darkness.

<b>               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
</b>
               Eric comes out of the front door. Inside the party is still 
               in progress. He gets into a Cadillac and drives off.

<b>               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAWN
</b>
               Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's 
               house.

               The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road.

               There's the sound of a phone being dialled.

<b>                                     CARTER (V.O.)
</b>                         Police.

<b>               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
</b>
               A long line of police cars move slowly up the drive, 
               followed by a police bus. They park by the front door and 
               around fifty policemen pour out. They move silently around 
               the building. A chief constable opens the front door and 
               walks in.

<b>               INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
</b>
               The police move through the house and grounds. In the 
               bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The 
               men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about 
               being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, 
               pornography and so on.

               Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass 
               leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They 
               follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, 
               face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes 
               in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we 
               see that it's Margaret.

<b>               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN
</b>
               The house is surrounded by police measuring and 
               photographing, and outside the house are police cars and 
               ambulances.  The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In 
               the early-morning light, they look like dolls.

               Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes 
               officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes 
               down the short drive to the gate.

<b>               INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN
</b>
               Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide 
               beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his 
               left.

               The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a 
               harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast 
               wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal 
               loader for tankers.

               This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and 
               pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top 
               tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal 
               chutes.

<b>               EXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN
</b>
               Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle 
               of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to 
               the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man 
               is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. 
               He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. 
               Carter follows.

               At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only 
               the harbour waters lapping below.

               Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see 
               Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the 
               roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly 
               above him.

               Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's 
               playing cat and mouse with Eric.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                              (calling out)

                         race, Eric.

                         Sod off.

               Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and 
               makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway. 
               Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the 
               gun up. Eric stops and looks up.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Stay away from the car or I'll 
                         blow you apart.  

               Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps. 
               He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards 
               the beach. Carter starts after him.

<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</b>
               Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his 
               feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting.

               In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke.  Carter 
               appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at 
               the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and 
               starts running.

<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</b>
               Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and 
               panics. He stumbles and falls over.

               He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the 
               headland. Carter follows.

<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</b>
               On the other side of the headland, the scene is 
               extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the 
               world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's 
               littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep 
               in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the 
               left. It's deserted.

               In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets 
               move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit 
               their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal 
               mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The 
               sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore.  

               Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. 
               Carter closes on him.

<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</b>
               Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the 
               mine.  Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and 
               crash as they move along the cable.

               Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal 
               slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on 
               his heels.  Near the top, where the buckets are practically 
               at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too 
               exhausted to get up.

               Carter stands over him.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                              (panting slightly)
                         Stand up, Eric. Stand up.

               Eric just manages it. Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch 
               out of his pocket.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         I bet you could use a drink, could 
                         you, Eric?  

               He throws the bottle to Eric.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Eh? Have a drink.

<b>                                     ERIC
</b>                         Still got your sense of humour.

               Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter. He's in a 
               terrible state.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want 
                         you to drink all of that. Do you 
                         understand? Drink up. Just like it 
                         was with my brother, Frank. Go on, 
                         son. Drink up.

               Eric pours the whisky into his month. It spills over and 
               runs down his face.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Drink up, Eric.

               Eric begins to stagger about.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         It was you who poured it down him. 
                         Eh, Eric?  

               Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter. No 
               mercy there.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Did you all have a good laugh, eh? 
                         Did you have a good laugh when he 
                         was spewing it up? The whisky is 
                         pouring all over Eric's face and 
                         suit.

               It's disgusting to watch. Suddenly, he retches, but nothing 
               comes up.

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Drink it! Drink it! Did you all 
                         pass the bottle round after the 
                         car went over the top?  

               Eric is choking.

</b>                         Don't stop, Eric.

               Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle 
               up to Eric's mouth again. In the other, he holds the 
               shotgun.  Eric chokes and retches. Carter has seen enough. 

<b>                                     CARTER
</b>                         Goodbye, Eric.

               Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on 
               Eric's head.

<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY
</b>
               Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on 
               it's final journey. Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun 
               riding on his shoulder. The bucket shudders and grinds as 
               it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final 
               journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic 
               catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal 
               slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over 
               and everything is gone.

               Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the 
               beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get 
               rid of it.

<b>               EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING
</b>
               Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. He raises 
               the shotgun to throw it away. High on the clifftop a rifle 
               and telescopic lens line up on Carter. A finger curls around 
               the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a 
               large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It 
               is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his 
               death. 

               The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a 
               quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.

<b>               EXT. BEACH - EARLY MORNING
</b>
               Carter lies on the beach. The waves lap around his head. A 
               small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple. 
               He's dead.

<b>               EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING

               Kinnear's hit man coolly dismantles his rifle. He carefully 
               wraps it in a cloth fishing-rod carrier. He walks off and 
               is soon lost as he drops out of sight.
