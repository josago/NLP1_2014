<b>               EXT. PRISON CEMETERY -- DAY
</b>
               A handful of people are gathered in an open field under a 
               fierce Mississippi sun. A couple of young inmates, JAKE and 
               LEON, lean on their shovels. They are waiting to bury two 
               identical CASKETS with inmate numbers stenciled on the 
               pinewood lids.

               A GUARD rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes 
               a long, healthy pull from his canteen. He offers it to the 
               PRISON CHAPLAIN, who is much obliged. SUPERINTENDENT BILL 
               BURKE, a 40-year-old black man, glances at his watch and 
               loosens his tie. Sure is hot.

               MARY HUMPHRIES, an elderly white woman in a nurse's uniform, 
               stands behind WILLIE LONG, an ancient inmate sleeping 
               peacefully in a wheelchair. She readjusts an umbrella to 
               shield the old black man from the blistering sun.

               Burke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief. He gives the 
               nod to the chaplain, who steps forward and cracks his bible. 
               The men remove their hats.

</b>                         In accordance with the regulations 
                         of the State of Mississippi, we gather 
                         here today to lay to rest the remains 
                         of inmates R. Gibson, number 4316, 
                         and C. Banks, number 4317. Ashes to 
                         ashes, dust to dust. May God have 
                         mercy on their souls.

</b>                         Go ahead, fellas.

               The young inmates plunge their shovels into the dirt. One by 
               one, the mourners head back toward a prison van parked on a 
               nearby dirt road.

                         while, Willie...

               She leaves Willie alone with Jake and Leon. He rolls his 
               chair up to the edge of the graves and gazes at the pinewood 
               caskets.

</b>                         Why do I get the feeling when you 
                         say some time, you mean some time.

</b>                         I was already here a good many years 
                         when they came in in 1932.

</b>                         Sixty-five years ago. They always 
                         said the farm couldn't hold 'em 
                         forever. Looks like you're finally 
                         free, boys.

               Willie pulls a bottle of moonshine from his jacket and takes 
               a swig in their honor.

                         up.

               Willie passes the bottle to Leon, who takes a swig and winces 
               from the unexpected kick.

<b>                                     LEON
</b>                         Hell of a way to get out. Heard they

</b>                         I seen the bodies before they sealed

                         Looked like some shit from the X-

                              (taking a swig from 
                              the bottle)
                         Damn, that shit's nasty.

                         was concerned.

               Willie holds up the bottle, checking the clarity of the 
               liquor.

<b>               EXT. SPANKY'S BACK ALLEY (1932) -- NIGHT
</b>
               RAY GIBSON holds up a similar bottle of liquor to a light 
               over a door. Music comes from within. He takes a swig and 
               stashes the bottle in his belt. He adjusts his tie, polishes 
               his shoes on the back of his pants and raps on the door.

<b>               INT. SPANKY'S -- NIGHT
</b>
               The speakeasy is jumping, jammed with people. Up on stage a 
               hot JAZZ BAND is playing backup for a seductive CHANTEUSE. 
               Well-heeled PATRONS enter through doors near the stage.

               In the back, at the end of a long hallway, a BOUNCER cracks 
               open the door and Ray squeezes inside.

<b>                                     BOUNCER
</b>                         Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's 
                         not happy with you.

</b>                         Do yourself a favor and find another

                         door.

                         I have to be where the action is. 
                         Look, when your old lady wanted those 
                         alligator shoes, didn't I come through 
                         for you? Ain't she stepping in style 
                         now?

                         about this new tie?

                         too.

               Ray heads inside.

</b>                         Anyone asks, it wasn't me who let 
                         you in.

               Ray slides through the crowd, pausing at the bar to nibble 
               on the neck of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.

                         getting off.

               She carries a tray of drinks into the crowd. Ray shakes his 
               head in wonderment at her departing form. The BARKEEP steps 
               up as Ray pulls out his bottle.

<b>                                     BARKEEP
</b>                         You can't drink that in here, Ray.

<b>                                     RAY
</b>                         I sure can't drink that watered-down 
                         swill you're serving. Give me a glass 
                         of ice.

<b>                                     BARKEEP
</b>                         I can't give you a glass of ice. I 
                         can't give you anything until you 
                         pay your damn tab.

               Disregarding the warning, Ray tilts the bottle back. Shaking 
               his head, the barkeep moves on to a paying customer. Ray's 
               eyes follow a bottle of French Champagne as it is delivered 
               to a nearby table.

               Here sits the straight-laced CLAUDE BANKS with his girlfriend, 
               DAISY. She's enjoying the show. He's polishing the silverware. 
               The WAITER pours two glasses of champagne and leaves the 
               bottle on ice. Claude regards his glass skeptically.

                         here, you'd think they could hire 
                         somebody to actually wash the dishes.

                         at the bank. I always knew you'd 
                         make something of yourself.

               Daisy thinks she does. She leans in, eyes twinkling.

               French Champagne shoots out of Claude's nose.

                         babies. That's what you want, isn't

                         reason to rush into things. Damn, 
                         look at this shirt. I'll be right 
                         back.

               Claude leans in to kiss Daisy on the lips. She offers her 
               cheek. He departs.

               Claude steps into the bathroom and approaches the sink. A 
               big hand falls on his shoulder and yanks him backwards into

               They rifle through Claude's jacket and quickly find his

               Glancing around, Ray spots Claude's feet under the stall 
               door. He steps up to the sink, washes his hands and takes a 
               towel from the ATTENDANT. Scanning the assortment of grooming 
               products, he selects a bottle of cologne and takes a sniff.

                         You have any of that French stuff?

               As the attendent bends down to retrieve a bottle of the good 
               stuff, Ray palms a coin from the tip basket.

               Ray offers the quarter, a gesture of uncommon generosity.

               Ray pats the cologne on his face. A toilet flushes and Claude 
               steps over to the sink. Ray catches his eye in the mirror.

               Ray throws his arms around Claude, deftly snatching his 
               wallet. Claude extracts himself from Ray's embrace.

                         in mind.

               Claude straightens his jacket and heads for the door. Ray 
               stashes the stolen wallet in his jacket.

               On the stage, the chanteuse has downshifted into a sultry 
               number about back-door lovers and broken dreams.

               Ray steps out of the men's room and is instantly collared by 
               BULLETHEAD, a man who makes his living being large and 
               threatening.

                         covered.

               Pressed up against the wall, Ray reaches into his jacket and 
               produces Claude's wallet. Bullethead snatches it, inspects 
               it and is not impressed.

               He stuffs the wallet back into Ray's jacket and hustles Ray 
               out the back door past the bouncer who let him in.

               Claude returns to the table where Daisy is sipping champagne. 
               He takes the glass out of her hand.

               The waiter presents Claude with the bill.

<b>               INT. VAN -- NIGHT

               Claude is shoved into the back of the van and the doors are 
               slammed behind him. He bangs and shouts, but it's no use.

               Ray is stretched out against the back wall. Claude is knocked 
               to the floor as the van lurches into motion.

               Ray swigs from his bottle and offers it to Claude, who isn't 
               interested.

                         it, ain't it? A gambling debt.

               Busted, Claude snatches the bottle and carefully wipes off 
               the neck before tilting it high. Ray gets a good chuckle out 
               of this straight cat in the bow tie.

               Bullethead and a HENCHMAN pull Ray and Claude from the back 
               of the van. They find themselves in a dark warehouse filled 
               with crates of contraband.

               Claude shoves his hands under his armpits at the sound of 
               approaching FOOTSTEPS echoing across the vast space. Claude 
               and Ray peer into the darkness.

               SPANKY JOHNSON emerges into the light. He uses a small silver 
               spoon to take an ample snort of cocaine into each nostril. 
               He glances at Claude.

               his hands and feet. Spanky turns to Ray.

               The goons hoist Claude up on another pulley and dangle him 
               head first over a hole in the floor. Several feet down, the

               water. Ray reaches into his jacket. Bullethead pulls a gun 
               and presses it into Ray's temple. Ray gives him a look and 
               cautiously pulls out his bottle.

               Ray tosses him the bottle. Spanky uncorks, sniffs, samples 
               the goods. He's impressed.

</b>                         Comes up the Mississippi. I can get 
                         more. A lot more. I was thinking 
                         about going into business for myself, 
                         but under the circumstances, I'd be 
                         willing to take on a partner.

               Once again, the henchman yanks on the rope and Claude comes 
               up sucking air desperately. He releases the rope, submerging 
               Claude for a third time.

                         truck. I could be back in two, three 
                         days tops if I had somebody to share 
                         the driving.

               Spanky considers the terms. Can he afford to trust Ray? Can 
               he afford not to?

                         Pick your man and get going.

               Ray glances around. The pulley rope is still twitching in 
               the water.

                         full.

               Spanky sees Ray's point. He nods to the henchman, who hoists 
               Claude's limp body out of the water and onto the cement. 
               Spanky plants a foot on Claude's chest and applies pressure. 
               A geyser of Harlem River water shoots from Claude's mouth as 
               he sputters back to life.

               Tight-lipped, Claude shifts in his seat.

               Claude tugs Ray towards the door but Ray won't be dissuaded. 
               He boldly addresses a YOUNG MAN in an apron behind the 
               counter.

               Billy's MAMA sets a piping hot pie on the back counter and 
               steps up next to her son. She casts a disparaging glance at 
               Claude's suit.

               Claude lays down a dollar bill. Mama casually pulls a shotgun

               Ray gives the whole place a cool once-over as Claude pulls 
               him out the door. Mama turns to Billy, still studying the

               The truck rolls up to the waters edge. Ray kills the engine 
               and flashes the lights twice. In the passenger seat, Claude 
               is fast asleep. After a few moments, a FAT MAN appears, 
               shining a flashlight into the cab.

               Under cover of darkness, a couple of MEN finish loading crates 
               into the bed of the truck. Ray and Claude keep their eyes 
               peeled for the law. Down by the river, they can see lights 
               and hear music from a district of rowdy juke joints. SLIM 
               steps up, wiping his hands.

               A ramshackle den of iniquity on the banks of the Mississippi. 
               The band is laying down some serious Delta blues, creating 
               an inviting atmosphere for sin and moral corruption.

               On a far side of the room, Ray is playing poker with some 
               LOCALS. He seems to be having a bad night. WINSTON HANCOCK,

               Perched on a stool, Claude shoots a dark look at Ray and 
               motions for the door. Ray waves him off and returns to his 
               game. Claude becomes aware of a soft, young female hand on 
               his shoulder.

               Against his better judgement, Claude's gaze follows the long, 
               slender arm up past a bare shoulder and settles on SYLVIA'S 
               angelic face. He is struck dumb.

               The bartender refills their glasses.

<b>               BACK AT THE POKER TABLE
</b>
               Winston considers his cards, hardly looking up as a WAITRESS 
               lays down a cocktail napkin and sets a drink down on top of 
               it. He glances at Ray, who casually considers his cards.

</b>                         I'll take two.

               The dealer tosses Ray a couple of cards.

               INSERT -- Ray fans his cards to reveal a full house.

               After considering the other players at the table, Ray pushes 
               what's left of his money into the center of the table. The 
               three other PLAYERS fold with disgust. Winston squints long 
               and hard at Ray, then pushes everything he has into the center 
               of the table.

</b>                         I'll see that...

               Winston reaches into his jacket and throws down some more 
               money on the pile.

                         with you yet.

               Ray checks his cards again. He looks at the pot, it's a lot 
               of money. With this hand, there's no way he can lose. He 
               places his daddy's pocket watch on top of the pile. Winston 
               checks the time piece.

</b>                         That'll cover it.

               Ray lays down his hand.

</b>                         Four threes.

               Ray sits back, stunned. Winston rakes in his winnings. The 
               game is over for the night. The three other players head to 
               the bar.

                         Have a round on me.

               Winston tosses a silver dollar to Ray, who snatches it out 
               of the air. Winston drops his hat on his head and moves 
               through the crowd and out the door.

               Ray shakes his head. Carefully, she begins to clear the table. 
               Suddenly, he grabs her wrist. Winston's glass tips over. Ray 
               flips over the cocktail napkin to reveal an extra pile of 
               cards.

                         along.

               Ray dashes into the street, glancing both ways. No sign of 
               Winston. Damn.

<b>               EXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT
</b>
               Winston produces Ray's pocket watch and pops it open. A smile 
               crosses his face as the mechanical tune plays.

               A sheriff's sedan rounds a corner, illuminating Winston in 
               its headlights. The car pulls up and SHERIFF WARREN PIKE 
               steps out. Distinguished by a casual cruelness, he's a young 
               white man who loves his uniform.

</b>                         If it isn't Winston Hancock.

               Winston tries to move past Pike, but the sheriff blocks his 
               path with a night stick. As Winston backs off, another squad 
               car pulls up behind him. TWO DEPUTIES step from the car, 
               guns drawn.

<b>                                     PIKE
</b>                         I thought we agreed that you were

</b>                         I tried to leave, Sheriff Pike. But 
                         your wife begged me to stay.

               Pike slams Winston with his club, sending the black man to 
               his knees. As Winston struggles back to his feet, a stiletto 
               flashes and he lunges for the sheriff, slashing his cheek. 
               The deputies grab Winston from behind, holding him by both 
               arms. The long knife clatters to ground. Pike touches his 
               face, examining the blood on his fingers.

               Ray walks slowly down the hallway to Room 13. He is about to 
               knock when he hears the sound of lovemaking from within.

<b>               INT. SYLVIA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Ray opens the door and peeks in. Sylvia's on top and in 
               charge. Claude is concentrating real hard. Ray smiles to 
               himself and closes the door.

               Claude hitches up his suspenders as he comes down the stairs. 
               He finds Ray having a drink at the now-empty bar.

                         I swear it was back that way.

               Suddenly, the bloodied figure of Winston Hancock lurches 
               from the shadows and grabs Claude by the lapels. Claude is 
               too scared to scream, staggering backward. But the man's 
               grip loosens and he slips to the ground.

               Ray turns back to find Claude trembling with fear and covered 
               in blood. He just points down. Ray eyes widen. He kneels 
               down and turns Winston's body over.

               Much to Claude's horror, Ray starts rifling through Winston's

               Suddenly, the glare of two bright headlights from a pickup

               Claude and Ray hoist Winston's body to its feet. The man 
               raises his lantern, takes a closer look at Winston's face.

               The jailhouse door opens and Sheriff Pike walks in. He pauses 
               to give the prisoners the once-over. There's a fresh bandage

               Ray and Claude stare out the window, getting their first

               Along the road, CONVICTS cast hard looks at the new men as 
               the cart passes. A WHITE SERGEANT on horseback shifts his 
               rifle and casually spits tobacco juice in the dirt...

               A low-slung, single-story bunkhouse surrounded by a dirt 
               yard. Two shooter shacks sit at diagonal corners of the yard. 
               In each shack, two trusties with rifles keep vigilant watch 
               over the camp. SGT. FRED DILLARD paces down the line of new 
               men as HOPPIN' BOB, an uncommonly ugly trusty, unlocks their 
               leg irons.

                         done to get here, believe me, we're

                         probably noticing that we have no 
                         fences here at Camp 8. We don't need 
                         no fences, we have the gun line. It 
                         runs from shack to shack clear around 
                         the yard. You are now inside the gun 
                         line. If you step outside the gun 
                         line without my permission, you will 
                         be shot. If you trip and fall over 
                         the gun line, you will be shot. If 
                         you spit, if you pee, if you stick 
                         your ass out and take a dump over 
                         the gun line, you will be shot.

               Dillard plucks a hat off one of the new prisoners and tosses 
               it over the gun line. SHOTS ring out from the nearest shack. 
               The hat is torn to shreds.

               All activity comes to a halt as the new men shuffle into the

               slams the metal doors shut behind them.

               The inmates jump down from the mule cart and grab hoes and

               for each man. Dillard stands by with his shotgun.

               flashes a shiny grin and clobbers Ray with a fist the size

               Dillard checks the thermometer on the truck -- 90 degrees

               The sun arcs overhead, a blazing inferno... Heat rises off 
               the road... The men sweat profusely... "Taking it off here,

               Biscuit has his work cut out for him, lugging a water bucket

               A NEW GUY lets his hammer slip from his fingers, collapses

               A hard white light from Hoppin' Bob's flashlight shines 
               directly into the CAMERA.

               CLOSE ON Ray, in his bed, back in the old bunkhouse. The 
               music stops abruptly. He shields his eyes from the harsh 
               light. Hoppin' Bob is looming over him. It's back to reality.

               A loud burst of flatulence cuts through the darkness. Hoppin' 
               Bob turns his flashlight on Cookie.

               Scowling, Hoppin' Bob steps out of the cage and locks the 
               door behind him. The men slowly settle back in.

               Ray gets in Claude's face and silently mouths the word -- 
               "soft." Claude throws down his hoe and sinks his fist deep 
               into Ray's gut.

               Ray touches the blood coming from his nose. Eyes blazing, he 
               tackles Claude, dragging him to the ground. The two men roll 
               around, trying to strangle each other.

               Hoppin' Bob hustles down the hill and drags Ray off of Claude. 
               But Claude comes back for more. Hoppin' Bob finds himself in 
               the middle of the fray.

               That's when the cavalry arrives. Two trusties use their rifles 
               to crack Ray and Claude over the backs of their heads, sending 
               them both down for the count.

               Hoppin' Bob empties his canteen over their faces. They sputter 
               back to consciousness.

               Ray and Claude stagger to their feet and pick up their tools. 
               Hoppin' Bob and the trusties head back up the hill. Ray starts 
               to chuckle.

               One by one, the prisoners of Camp 8 climb into the mule carts

               he removes a pebble from his pocket. The last one in is 
               Willie. Hoppin' Bob's pocket is now empty.

               Ray shrugs and presses on. Dumbfounded, Claude considers the 
               map again, then tears it to shreds. The braying of hounds 
               echoes through the trees.

               Ray and Claude race through the underbrush.

<b>               EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT

               Dillard and his men follow the dogs through the woods, hot 
               on the scent.

<b>               EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT
</b>
               Ray and Claude race up to a chain-link fence. On the other 
               side, an old Ford is parked on a dirt road. Hearing the posse 
               closing in behind them, Ray and Claude fling themselves onto 
               the fence.

<b>               EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT
</b>
               The posse is gaining ground. Dillard takes two men off to 
               the left, sending the rest of the men straight ahead.

<b>               EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT
</b>
               Claude clears the fence first and scrambles for the old Ford. 
               Ray's shirt snags on a piece of wire as he drops down from 
               the fence. Stuck, he dangles helplessly a few feet off the 
               ground.

<b>               INT. FORD -- NIGHT
</b>
               Claude yanks open the door and jumps behind the wheel. TWO 
               WHITE TEENAGERS bolt up in the backseat where they were 
               necking. After a beat -- group scream. The half-dressed 
               teenagers dive from the car and scramble off down the road. 
               Claude twists the key in the ignition and the engine roars 
               to life.

</b>                         I'm stuck!

               Claude sees Ray caught up on the fence, then hears the sounds 
               of the approaching posse. If he floored it right now, he 
               might make it. But he can't just leave Ray hanging there.

<b>               EXT. FENCE -- NIGHT
</b>
               Claude runs up and grabs Ray's legs, pulling for all he's 
               worth. The shirt rips free, sending Ray and Claude tumbling 
               to the ground. They leap to their feet and turn toward the 
               car -- running smack into the barrel of Dillard's shotgun.

<b>               EXT. SUPERINTENDENT'S MANSION -- DAY

               An OLD BLACK PRISONER delivers a frosty mint julep to 
               SUPERINTENDENT ABERNATHY who rocks slowly in his chair. At 
               his feet, his 10-year-old daughter MAE ROSE is playing jacks. 
               Her long blonde hair makes her look like a little angel.

                         men who escaped last night.

               Mae Rose is pointing down the drive, where Dillard and a

               Bound by leg irons and handcuffs, Ray and Claude are deposited 
               at the bottom of the stairs.

                         should we teach these two a lesson?

               Mae Rose considers their faces. Ray and Claude look like 
               they've been to hell and back.

               Dillard nods and turns Ray and Claude around. As they march 
               back down the drive, Abernathy takes sip of his mint julep 
               and affectionately pats Mae Rose on the head.

               The trusties shove them each into a small, dank cell and 
               slam the doors behind them. Dillard secures both doors with

               Claude considers his bleak surroundings. It's a small,

               connects with a mighty CRACK! The incorrigibles crane their 
               necks as the ball disappears into the sky. They turn to look 
               at Can't Get Right. Ray gives Claude a significant look, 
               then tosses another ball out to Jangle Leg on the mound.

               Jangle Leg nods, winds up and delivers a whistling fast ball.

               The inmates of Camp 12 are in the field. Our boys from Camp

               opposition from the third base line.

               The PITCHER winds up and releases a fast ball. Cookie swings 
               and connects for a base hit up the middle.

               appeals to the gods. The pitcher winds up and releases a 
               fast ball. Can't Get Right connects with that familiar CRACK! 
               Blocker stands up and watches the ball clear the fence and 
               just keep going.

               With his team cheering him on, Can't Get Right trots around

               The NURSE turns around, cradling the baby in her arms. 
               Abernathy gently pulls back the soft blanket. His eyes widen 
               with horror upon discovering that the newest member of the 
               Abernathy family is black.

               Abernathy drives his sedan up to the bunkhouse. All of his 
               worldly possessions are strapped to the roof. It appears 
               that the Abernathys are leaving town. In the back seat, Mae 
               Rose cradles her baby. Her mother sits next to her. Dillard 
               steps out into the yard to confer with the Superintendent, 
               then turns to address the inmates.

               Abernathy holds his newborn grandson up next to Ray's face. 
               Hmm. Scowling, he moves a little further down the line, 
               scrutinizing the features of each man. He pauses in front of 
               Claude, holds up the baby. Maybe. Abernathy stops in front 
               Goldmouth. Holds up the baby. The possibility makes him 
               shudder. He moves on to Can't Get Right. His eyes narrow.

                         camp. I can feel it in my bones.

               Disgusted, Abernathy hands the baby back to Mae Rose. Then 
               he turns, walks back to Can't Get Right and places a revolver 
               against his head.

                         little chocolated baby is?

               Can't Get Right nods slowly. Abernathy smiles.

</b>                         Well, then, who is it?

               Up and down the line, the men brace themselves for the worst. 
               Can't Get Right just grins. Enraged, Abernathy cocks the 
               revolver. That's when Ray steps forward.

</b>                         The baby's mine, boss.

               Stunned, Abernathy lowers the gun and approaches Ray. Then 
               Claude steps forward.

               And so it goes down the line, until every last man of Camp 8 
               has stepped forward to claim kinship with the Superintendent. 
               Even hard-ass Dillard can't help cracking a smile. Disgusted, 
               confused and thoroughly fed up, Abernathy jams the revolver 
               into his belt and climbs into the car. As he guns the engine, 
               Mae Rose gazes out the back window, smiling one last time at 
               the father of her baby. Can't Get Right smiles back.

               It's visiting Sunday and Ray's Boom Boom Room is in full 
               swing. Sylvia's girls are everywhere. Down at the gunline, 
               Dillard takes his cut from inmates lined up for their turn 
               in the tonk. A FIVE-PIECE PRISON BAND is playing the blues. 
               Nearby, Willie is dispensing Ray's moonshine from a bunkhouse 
               window. He raises a jar in a toast.

               The incorrigibles erupt in boisterous agreement. Claude grabs 
               Can't Get Right and shakes him.

                         the type to kiss and tell.

               Just then, Rev. Clay and his daughter emerge from the mess 
               hall and start across the yard. It's a good thing the old 
               man is blind because he wouldn't want to see how far his 
               flock has strayed. The Reverend inhales deeply as one of 
               Sylvia's girls passes nearby.

               Blissed out incorrigibles enjoy a last dance as the band 
               downshifts into a slow, sultry number. In the midst of the 
               dancers, Claude clings to Sylvia. Nearby, Jangle Leg dances 
               intimately with a YOUNG WOMAN.

               Up on the porch, Ray refreshes Biscuit's drink. Biscuit has 
               been crying and it shows. The liquor probably isn't helping.

               He pulls some folded sheets of paper from his pocket, passes 
               them to Ray.

               Ray gives Poker face a shove, then turns back to Biscuit.

                         sure know I would.

               Ray hands back the papers and heads off to dance with a PRETTY 
               YOUNG WOMAN lingering nearby. Left alone, Biscuit polishes 
               off his moonshine and checks his reflection in the bunkhouse 
               window.

               He crumples the discharge papers and drops them. Then he 
               steps down from the porch and walks calmly past the dancing 
               prisoners toward the gun line.

               Ray lifts his head off his date's shoulder. Something about 
               the way Biscuit is walking suggests that he isn't going to 
               stop.

               But it's too late. Biscuit crosses the gun line and keeps 
               walking, his eyes focused on the horizon.

               The band stops playing, the dancers grow still. Dillard turns 
               around and squints.

               But Biscuit isn't paying attention. He breaks into a run. 
               Dillard nods to Hoppin' Bob who raises his rifle and draws a 
               bead. But he can't pull the trigger. He lowers his gun.

               Shots ring out from the shooter shacks. Biscuit reels from 
               the impact of the bullets and looks down sadly at the blood 
               spreading across his ring-arounds...

               Prisoners silently gather at the gunline. Jangle Leg pushes 
               his way through the crowd and crosses the gunline without 
               hesitation. Dillard indicates for the shooters to hold their 
               fire. They train their rifles on Jangle Leg as he strides 
               toward his fallen companion. Jangle Leg gently lifts Biscuit's 
               lifeless body into his big arms and somberly carries him 
               back toward the camp. The CAMERA RISES HIGH OVERHEAD as the 
               prisoners make way for Jangle Leg to cross back over the 
               gunline.

               A dark mood hangs over the men. Jangle Leg sits stoically as 
               Radio fiddles with his receiver. Nearby, Poker Face and Ray 
               play a listless game of gin rummy. Claude is thumbing 
               distractedly through a dog-eared copy of Baseball Digest.

               But nobody can muster much enthusiasm for this news. Radio 
               shrugs and drops down on his bunk.

               Just then, Can't Get Right walks past heading for the door. 
               He's dressed in civilian clothes, his bindle slung over his

               Claude looks into the big kid's eyes.

               Can't Get Right steps across the gun line. Blocker opens the 
               car door for him. But before he climbs in, Can't Get Right 
               reaches into his pocket and pulls out his rubber ball. With 
               a smile, he tosses it to Claude, who snatches it out of the

               Blocker tips his hat and climbs behind the wheel. Claude and 
               Ray watch Blocker's car drive off under a red Mississippi

               Claude stands at the gun line, staring across at the Dillard 
               house. Mrs. Dillard places a couple of pies on the windowsill 
               to cool.

               Suddenly, he makes a break for the Dillard house.

               Ray turns to see Claude dashing across no-man's land. Shots 
               ring out from the shooter shack, kicking up dirt around 
               Claude's feet as he serpentines across the field.

               Breathless, Claude makes it to the kitchen window and digs 
               his hand into the golden-brown crust, shoving a sloppy fistful 
               of pie into his mouth. More shots ring out. Bullets PING all 
               around him. Grabbing the pie, he darts around the side of 
               the building, out of range. Back against the wall, he drops 
               down on his haunches, snarfing pie like a hungry wolf.

               A case of empty Coke bottles sits in the middle of the yard, 
               glinting in the hot sun. His face smeared with boysenberry, 
               Claude finishes taking off his boots and socks and steps 
               barefoot onto the bottles.

                         you step down off them bottles -- if 
                         one toe so much as touches the dirt -- 
                         one of these boys is gonna shoot you

                         man for this job.

               He takes a trusty's rifle and moves among the inmates, who 
               have gathered around. He stops when he gets to Ray.

               Ray glances at Claude, then back at Dillard.

                         you out the gate.

               Dillard offers the rifle to Ray, who doesn't have to think 
               too long.

               Ray's been given the same treatment as Claude. Barefoot, 
               balanced on Coke bottles, the two men stand a few feet apart 
               facing each other. A trusty with a rifle keeps an eye on 
               them. After years of silence, the tension reaches the breaking 
               point...

                         and be half way to New York right 
                         now.

</b>                         After all these years of blissful 
                         silence, I almost forgot how annoying 
                         the sound of your voice can be.

                         that's all.

               The trusty tightens his grip on his rifle. He'd love the 
               opportunity.

                         thought I'd mention it.

                         you ask me.

               They stand in stony silence. Then Ray starts to laugh. A 
               long, low belly laugh.

                         those pies, bullets flying all around

                         pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.

               The two men start to laugh. Really laugh. Nearly a decade's 
               worth of laughter comes welling up out of them, and they 
               nearly lose their balance, which only makes them laugh harder.

               A trusty bangs the rap iron. Young prisoners pour from the 
               bunkhouse and line up for breakfast. Claude and Ray bring up 
               the rear, the elder statesmen of the bunch. By a long shot.

                         miss you.

               Ray and Claude share a look. Then Ray embraces Dillard, who 
               stoically endures the breach of his personal space.

               Up on the porch, Claude brings a tray of minted iced tea to 
               Superintendent Wilkins, who sets aside his bible and washes 
               down a couple of pills.

               Before going back inside, Claude can't resist taunting Ray, 
               busy trimming a hedge out in the hot sun.

               Claude and Ray beat the bulrushes with switches, rustling a 
               couple of pheasants from their hiding spot. As the birds 
               take wing, Wilkins aims his shot gun and fires twice in rapid 
               succession. Both birds fall from the sky in a flutter of 
               feathers.

               suspiciously through the dining room window as he hacks at a

               Ray hacks a rose bush down to the nub. From the garage comes 
               the sound of an engine turning over. Wilkins' 1973 Lincoln 
               Continental convertible lurches down the drive with Claude 
               at the wheel. He screeches to a halt inches from Ray's legs 
               and climbs from the car.

               Ray scowls as Claude straightens his chauffeur uniform and 
               heads up the path to the mansion.

<b>               EXT. GREENVILLE BUS STATION -- DAY

               Claude pulls up in front of the station, steps out of the 
               car and holds the door for Wilkins, who checks his watch.

               Wilkins heads into the station, leaving Claude alone with 
               the Continental. All around him are the sights, sounds and 
               smells of the free world. A woman rushes into the arms of a 
               man as he climbs off a bus. Across the street is Grandma 
               Dodi's Pork Rib Joint where Cookie never made it to the peach 
               cobbler. A young brother with a boom box walks by. In the 
               street, kids crowd around the back of an ice cream truck. 
               Then Claude catches his reflection in the car window and 
               frowns. When did he get this old? Unnerved, he moves around 
               to the back of the car and pops open the trunk.

               Ray looks, Claude clocks him. Ray slumps back into the trunk. 
               Claude stuffs Ray's legs back into the trunk and slams the 
               lid.

               He looks up just as Wilkins and the new superintendent exit 
               the bus station. Warren Pike's hair has gone grey and he's 
               40 years older, but there's no mistaking the former sheriff 
               of Natchez County. He still bears a nasty scar on his cheek 
               from a wound inflicted long ago.

               CLAUDE'S POV -- Pike appears as a young man in his sheriff's 
               uniform striding slowly toward him.

               Claude blinks and looks again. Pike has returned to his old 
               self as he and Wilkins step up.

                         There you go, boy.

               Oblivious, Pike climbs into the back seat. Wilkins nods to 
               Claude.

               Claude snaps to it, grabbing the bags. He considers opening 
               the trunk, but decides to carry them around to the front 
               seat with him.

                         and zip. Claude bends down and picks 
                         up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a 
                         tray next to an identical one.

               enters from the kitchen with the two steaming bowls of gumbo.

               Pike curls his lip with disdain before taking a healthy 
               spoonful of gumbo.

               Claude and Ray beat the bullrushes with switches. Amid a 
               flutter of wings, three pheasants take to the air. Wilkins 
               fires first, knocking one out the sky. Pike pulls off two 
               rounds, playing clean up.

               Ray and Claude dump their game bags into the back of a pickup 
               truck. Nearby, Pike drains his flask while Wilkins scrapes 
               mud off his boots. The breeze picks up, clouds fill the sky.

               Pike pulls a gold watch from his pocket and releases the 
               face plate. A familiar mechanical tune floats on the gathering 
               breeze. Ray turns around slowly. His eyes fall on the watch 
               in Pike's hand. His daddy's watch. In Pike's hand.

               Ray grabs the barrel of the shotgun and slams it into Pike's 
               face. Pike rolls over and freezes, staring down the barrel 
               of his own gun now in Ray's hands. Confused, Wilkins points 
               his gun at Ray.

               Claude lowers the gun. Bewildered, Wilkins does the same.

               Ray mouths the word -- "soft." Claude clenches his jaw, points 
               the gun and pulls the trigger. Click.

               Pike smirks and pulls a small gun from his boot. But as he 
               raises it -- BLAM! Pike is hurled backward by a shotgun blast. 
               Shocked, Ray and Claude look at Wilkins, his gun still smoking 
               in his hands.

               After a significant beat, Ray reaches down and gingerly 
               retrieves his daddy's gold pocket watch.

               One of the deputies pats Wilkins sympathetically on the back. 
               Then he and his partner put away their notebooks and head 
               for their vehicle. Wilkins heads up the steps and into the

               Visibly shaken, Wilkins takes a seat, wiping the sweat from

                         Then, before I could figure out what 
                         to do with it, it was gone. Imagine 
                         my disappointment.

               On the radio, the announcer voice rises in pitch as the 
               Yankees score. Ray and Claude share a satisfied look.

               Ray closes his eyes and settles in for a nap. Claude turns 
               to watch Jonesy squeaking away. Something about what Ray

               "Oprah" blares on the television. Old convicts linger about 
               in various states of repose and decay. A young ORDERLY pops 
               to the music on his Walkman as he pushes a cart through the

               Over at a table, Ray and Claude play poker with Willie, a 
               SHAKY OLD JUNKIE and TWO YOUNG GANG BANGERS. The currency on

               Ray pushes his bet to the center of the table. The shaky 
               junkie folds. Willie tosses in some pills and turns to Gang

               He tosses down his cards. The shaky junkie attempts to light 
               a cigarette. The match slips from his trembling fingers and 
               falls into his lap.

               The remaining players match the pot. Gang Banger #2 reveals 
               his cards. Willie frowns. Ray lays down his cards and 
               victoriously sweeps his winnings into a paper cup. Across 
               the room, Nurse Humphries enters with a tray of snacks. She,

               nearby slurping on Jell-O. His robe hangs open.

               Disgusted, Ray discards his own Jell-O. He pulls out his 
               daddy's pocket watch and checks the time. The little

</b>                         It's alright for a man to cry once 
                         in awhile. Just don't make a habit 
                         of it.

</b>                         Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, 
                         anyway?

<b>                                     WILLIE
</b>                         Nothing to it, really. Claude figured 
                         they could steal a couple of bodies 
                         from the morgue. They got a couple 
                         of crackers working there don't know 
                         their asses from their elbows. Then 
                         they was gonna set fire to the 
                         infirmary and make it look like those 
                         bodies was them that got stuck inside. 
                         Claude figured during the commotion, 
                         it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto 
                         one of the fire trucks and hang tight 
                         until it rolled right on out of here 
                         in the morning.

               The young inmates share a look, then glance into the graves, 
               then look back at Willie.

</b>                         I never said it didn't work.

               Leon and Jake do the arithmetic. You can almost hear the 
               gears grinding under the strain.

                         and Claude in those boxes?

               Willie starts to chuckle and sets his electric wheel chair 
               on auto-pilot, leaving the young inmates to guess at the 
               truth.

<b>                                     JAKE
</b>                         What do you think about that?

</b>                         I think that old man lost his marbles 
                         about a hundred years ago. Come on, 
                         let's get this over with.

               They pick up their shovels and go back to work burying the 
               caskets.

</b>
               The CAMERA MOVES PAST a FIREMAN hosing down the truck, past 
               another group of soot-stained FIREMEN eating breakfast, and 
               pauses in front of two lockers. A couple of FIREMEN emerge 
               from the showers wrapped in towels and open their lockers. 
               They share a look.

                         Alright, which of you hambones took 
                         our clothes?

<b>               EXT. YANKEE STADIUM -- DAY -- WIDE SHOT
</b>
               Scalpers sell tickets. Vendors hawk souvenirs. Fans stream 
               up from the subway and through the gates. Somebody is singing 
               "The Star-Spangled Banner."

<b>               EXT. STANDS -- DAY
</b>
               In the middle of a capacity crowd, a VENDOR fixes two hot 
               dogs and passes them to a KID at the end of an aisle. The 
               kid passes them to the MAN next to him, and so on down the 
               line.

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS the hot dogs from face to face, some old, 
               some young, some black, some white -- it's New York City, 
               after all -- and finally the hot dogs arrive in a pair of 
               old, calloused black hands. Ray passes one of the dogs to 
               Claude.

</b>                         I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom 
                         urinating. He didn't wash his hands.

               Ray and Claude glance around confused as the wave rolls 
               through their section of the bleachers. What the fuck? Claude 
               inspects his hot dog.

                         it.

               Ray snatches back the hot dog.

               Ray is suddenly young again.

               Claude takes the ice cream. He, too, is suddenly young again.

               They look at each other and share a laugh.

                         fire.

               Claude pops the top on his ice cream. Suddenly, they are 
               both old again.

               the old days. MUSIC UP.
