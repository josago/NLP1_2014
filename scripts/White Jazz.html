    Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks
    occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white
    tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch
    over what was my left eye.

<b>                        ME (V.O.)
</b>              I'm old. And all I have left is the
              will to remember...

    I reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black &
    white picture of HER: this beatific blonde, sleeping. Below
    me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of
    Television Series, Empire Ridge, Retires.

    The Matriarch's picture in the middle.                            *

<b>                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              ...and the fear I'll forget...

    Slide HER over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30
    years younger now. Lift my eyes back to my reflection.

<b>                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              I killed innocent men. I betrayed
              sacred oaths. I reaped profit from
              horror. The names are dead or too
              guilty to tell. The events so
              brutal they beg to be re-told...

</b>
    The battered face of an Irish Pug. Same guy? No. A hard jab
    bashes the Pug out of frame. And there I am: next to the
    `Ring' Magazine Reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar.

<b>                        ME (V.O.)
</b>              Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice
              Division. LAPD. That's what my face
              looked like before.

    My point of view now: Irish Pug on the business end of this
    bantam Black's combos. Standing to my left: SERGEANT RICHARD
    "JUNIOR" STEMMONS. Twenty-six.

<b>                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              Junior Stemmons. A partner I never
              asked for. The scowl meant to hide
              a shit-scared kid who'd been
              teaching evidence classes three
              months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD
              lifer who never got past Sergeant.

<b>                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
</b>              We should make our move now.

<b>                        ME
</b>              Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you
              wanna be at the center of a riot?

<b>                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
</b>              I don't wanna be here when Noonan
              and the Feds show up.

    I point at the bantam Black:

<b>                        ME
</b>              We let Sanderline finish this
              beating, we get his gratitude.                          *

    Junior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for
    `Untouchables' to break the doors down. I hate the way panic
    smells when I stand this close to it.

<b>                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
</b>              We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too-

<b>                        ME
</b>              -relax Junior.


<b>3   INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              3
</b>
    The Bantam Black: SANDERLINE JOHNSON. Led through the double
    doors. He sees me, then his gaze shifts to Junior popping
    jabs inches from REUBEN RUIZ: a muscled middle-weight, fight-
    taped hands cuffed behind his back. I smile big:

<b>                        ME
</b>              Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of
              the LAPD and a real big fan-

<b>                        JUNIOR STEMMONS
</b>              -you're under arrest.

    Sanderline spooks, steps back. Turn and make sure Junior sees
    the fire in my eyes, keep staring at Junior as I speak to
    Sanderline again:

</b>


<b>                        ME
</b>              No you're not. Reuben is-

<b>                        REUBEN RUIZ
</b>              -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest-

<b>                        ME
</b>              -for being a ranked fighter who
              still steals hubcaps. Shut up.
                  (off Ruiz, back to
                   Sanderline)
              If I was gonna arrest you, I
              wouldn't have let you finish: and
              that hook-uppercut combo you got is
              something special.
                  (from Reuben, beat)
              Reuben's in custody. But you could
              be our Guest. Whaddya say?


<b>4   EXT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER                        4
</b>
    Me, Junior, Reuben, and Sanderline aim for the nearest exit.
    Behind the stands. Reuben and Sanderline in street clothes,
    hats pulled down tight. Feature the Announcer:

<b>                        RING ANNOUNCER
</b>              Ladies and Gentleman...due to
              circumstances beyond our control,
              Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this-

    -BOOS drown the PA. Beer and lit cigars shell the Announcer.
    Fights erupt in the stands. I can't stifle a chuckle. Three
    exits down: day late-dollar short Feds. WELLES NOONAN, elbows-
    out, surveying the scene like a half-assed Rommel.

<b>                        ME (V.O.)
</b>              Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy
              League Crimefighter. Launching a
              big boxing probe as a way to begin
              prying into everything else crooked
              and corrupt in LA.

    Move faster.

<b>                        ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              Unaware the LAPD was walking away
              with his two big witnesses.

    As we near the side exit I stop. Junior pauses, less than a
    foot from my face, pointing up at Noonan, pure panic.

</b>
    My P.O.V.: second row, washed-up gangster Mickey Cohen with a
    Blonde far too beautiful for his world, a woman you've seen
    before, but only in a yellowed B&W picture 30 years in the
    future. I can't take my eyes away...five seconds-

<b>                        JUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)
</b><b>              -HE SEES US!
</b>
    Noonan's gaze strafes us. I see him squint.

<b>                        ME
</b>              Then you can stop pointing at him.

    Double-time out the double-doors.

<b>                        ME

    Sanderline digs the digs: sports the Ambassador robe over his
    street clothes, reading the Bible.

<b>                        SANDERLINE JOHNSON
</b>              If they got shrimp.

<b>                        REUBEN RUIZ

              You get your badge in a cereal box?

<b>                        ME

          City of Angels.

<b>                    ME
</b>          Excellent Sanderline.

<b>                    REUBEN RUIZ

<b>                    ME
</b>          You live in LA, Asshole. You do not

Ruiz turns `caught-me' pink...I nod to Junior: split `em.
Playing adjoining hotel rooms like sweat boxes.

<b>                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
</b>          We get to spend time alone now.

<b>                    REUBEN RUIZ
</b>          Want some perfume?

Junior shoves Ruiz through the inner-door connecting the
rooms. Sanderline giggles. Close the door behind them. Sit
down inches from Sanderline, change my tone:

<b>                    ME
</b>          Stop laughing.

Instant quiet.

<b>                    ME (CONT'D)
</b>          What were you gonna tell Welles
          Noonan?
              (watch as he flinches)
          He has a subpoena with your name on
          it, Sanderline. Why would someone
          like you need to talk to the U.S.
          Attorney?

Sanderline staying silent...

<b>                    ME (CONT'D)
</b>          You're a legbreaker for the Mob. I
          know the Men that pay you for that
          will murder you if they hear you're

          And they don't have to. Now tell me
          what you were gonna tell Noonan-

-phone rings. Sanderline flinches for the second time.

<b>                    SANDERLINE
</b>          Bet you they ran outta shrimp.

I stand, step, answer it:

<b>                    ME
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                    UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)

Mild shock. Catalogue potential "who's"...

</b>          -yer gonna have to make a minute

          Spade might testify that Sam owns
          him and how we was grooming him for
          a title shot he was gonna tank. A

    Click. A breath. Drop the phone on the cradle...step to the
    window...open it...then I chuckle genuine:

<b>                        ME
</b>              Sanderline, you gotta see this...

    Trusting puppy Sanderline steps to the window:

<b>                          SANDERLINE JOHNSON
</b>              What'm I-

    -smash his head against the frame using his forward motion.
    He loses muscle control for the split-second it takes me to
    pitch his legs up and out. My face a quick-change evil mask.

    Feature Sanderline's nine-story fall. That Ambassador Hotel
    robe billows behind him like a cape. He detonates an overhead
    streetlight with a bomb sound, then hits the driveway.

    Unzip my fly, hustle into the bathroom, screams from outside
    now. Flush the toilet as Junior and Ruiz pile through the
    door. Step out, play it baffled: look at the bed where
    Sanderline sat, then the open window, screams floating up...

<b>                        ME
</b><b>              DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP?
</b>
    Lunge to the window: Sanderline post-mortem. Head shattered.
    Valets sprinting. Junior on the phone. Ruiz steps-up next to
    me: horrified. I keep staring at the smashed body...whisper:

<b>                        ME (CONT'D)

          town: `Gas Chamber' Bob cribbed my

Bethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power.

Bradley picks up a newspaper:

<b>                    ME

<b>                    ME
</b>          Bethune and Gallaudet don't think
          so.

<b>                    BRADLEY
</b>          Bob's happy because he wants to be
          State Attorney General and his most
          likely opponent will be Welles
          Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton
          Diskant, who's leading their City
          Council race, is endorsed by
          Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing
          the larger play.
              (with calculated emphasis)
          Noonan's new target will likely be
          the LAPD itself.

<b>                    ME

<b>                     BRADLEY
</b>          Because that's where I would aim: a
          subpoenaed Federal witness plummets
          to his death in the company of two
          LAPD detectives?
              (beat)
          This screams Police Corruption.                      *
          This offers Noonan the possibility
          of payback in the form of national
          headlines.

I wave it all off:

<b>                    ME

              (beat, flipping file open)
          Coroner's preliminary: white paint
          chips found embedded in Sanderline
          Johnson's scalp. A matching dent on
          the white window sill. I checked
          with the hotel switchboard and
          found a call was patched to your
          room at about the same time Johnson
          flew out of it.
              (beat, proclamation:)
          It shocks and sickens me that your
          allegiance to the Chicago mob would
          take precedence over the LAPD.

<b>                    ME (V.O.)
</b>          Junior picked up this Quiff jocking
          other Fags in a Men's Room. But
          Quiff was a Law Student who wanted
          his record kept clean.

Quiff nervous but cooing, dick out, on Diskant's thigh.
Junior just as nervous...reloading a camera.

<b>                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
</b>          He should suck his dick. Y'know?
          Put the icing on it.

A baffled moment as the comment registers.

<b>                    PETE
</b>          What?

<b>                    JUNIOR STEMMONS
</b>          Tell me that wouldn't sell
          it...plus he's a Communist.

<b>                    ME
</b>          We're ruining his career, not his
          soul. Reload the camera.

Diskant finally speaks: marble-mouthed. Pushes Quiff away:

<b>                    MORTON DISKANT
</b>          Off me!

Don't waste a second: grab Diskant by the hair, narrate his
immediate future.

<b>                    ME
</b>          Drop out of the City Council race
          or I send these pictures to the
          papers.

Diskant rips his head free. Rage. Blood from his mouth.         *
Scanning the room, sizing up the situation, then:               *

     Wait for the big futile scream/struggle. Keep waiting.
     Diskant just sits. No words. And now I wish he'd cry, throw
     punches, anything...but he doesn't. I turn to Junior:

<b>                         ME (CONT'D)
</b>               Take the Quiff home.

<b>                         ME
</b>               -of course it is.

     Junior pulls Quiff out the door. By his hand. Just Pete, Me,
     and Diskant now. Silent moments drag sour...

<b>                         ME (CONT'D)

     A long moment on me and Pete. Blunted by what we just heard.

</b>          The Department gave Magdalena a                      *
          monopoly on the LA dope trade
          decades ago-

</b>          Us Pollyanna -- LAPD. We bullet-
          proofed him in exchange for 60% of

          rat his competition and kill the

Examine the wounds closer. Catch myself petting the deceased
pooches. To Junior:

<b>                    ME
</b>          She didn't hear barking...so they
          were either lousy guard dogs...or
          they knew the Killer.

          You can't hit something this clean

Almost 6 AM and the club is still half full.

end. I stop and listen. Get my only smile of the day from       *

     Bethune Campaign Fundraiser turned Victory Bash. Big smiles
     beam above sunburned double-chins. Bethune the nucleus of a

My eyes narrow but stay smiling:

Koenig roars this big frightening laugh of his.

<b>                    KOENIG

Koenig's big laugh again. Moving toward Bradley now. Then
flashbulbs pop-blind. Panic: snapping pix of me? Relief: not
me. Hollywood types: this Buff McMan Meat-type and Her. I go
slack inches from the Press that yesterday wanted to roll in
my guts...but now they're just as entranced with her as I am.

She and McMan Meat continue past as I stare, she answers his
questions for him. I think her eyes see mine. Then I realize
where I'm standing. Bradley waiting. Focused on me and not
her -- God-damned Eunuch. I step over, speak without preface:

Swallow my sneer. Push through the service doors. Hard.
Headed back toward the kitchen, an exit sign. I pass an
alcove: Her. Alone. Smoke break. Beauty you almost never get

<b>                    MILTEER
</b>          An `Actress' named Glenda Bledsoe
          signed a Service Contract that
          she's now willfully violating by
          acting in a Z-grade horror picture
          presently `shooting' in Griffith
          Park. Despite entreaties for her to
          cease participation in this
          absurdity, she continues to revel
          in her outlaw status with us. Thus
          we would like her destroyed.

</b>          Exactly. The morality clause in

          devastating: Nymphomaniac,
          Criminal, Communist...anything
          along these lines. Once you visit
          the set of her `Attack of the
          Atomic Vampires,' you'll see the

<b>                         DIRECTOR
</b>               We're set on a place where we can
               stash you and Rock. It's in Topanga
               Canyon, two weeks-

                   (to the Director)
               Are you sure about this Sid? Seems
               shaky. Was this Mickey's idea?

<b>                         DIRECTOR
</b>               And I think it's brilliant!
               Inspired! The two leads of Mickey
               Cohen's magnum opus get kidnapped!
               The press'll eat it up! They'll
               write about `Gangster Mickey,' the
               glory days. Couple a' headlines
               like that and interest in Atomic

     My face folds up -- jealous-sour frown. I reach in, steal one   *
     of the steaming cups, bolt. Audible as I retreat:

     Parked. Tepid pulls off the stolen mug. Done. Toss it to the    *
     passenger side: lands on a bed of crumpled Styrofoam. Look
     up: the Magdalena residence looms a few doors down. Glance at
     the passenger seat: an envelope lined with fifty $100 bills.
     The name: BLEDSOE written across the front. Pick it up.

     Toss the envelope into the glove-box, slam it shut. Scan. Two
     heads in one of the unmarked patrol cars I ordered. Cursory
     nods as they pass. Tail-lights fade. Dead quiet save my low

     Startling: no blouse, pig-tails, big silver-dollar nipples
     touch/steam glass. Pushes the curtains back even further.
     Adrenaline cuts through the lactic acid: wide awake now.

     scanning -- hopeful to glimpse someone outside looking back.      *

               Hector Magdalena's disappearance.                       *

     She holds her scan for a blink, a different smile, eyes sex-
     placid now, rolled-back now -- she just saw what she was
     looking for: hidden eyes staring back at her. I look to where
     I saw her gaze kink...unholster my .45. Get out quiet.

     Cold for LA. Walking/scanning, .45 flush against my leg.
     Sticking to shadows. Cross the street: two homes down. Quiet
     steps. Closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter...

     Glance back up at the window, Lucille gone -- a forearm
     shiver flashes from nowhere blunts/blasts the back of my
     head. Nose-first into asphalt. Too angry to black out. Spit       *
     blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning:

Still unsure what hit me. Pick-up my gun, clear my nose of
gouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting
away: PEEPER. Wipe away impact-tears, aim, realize my trigger   *
finger is dislocated -- bent back ugly. Tuck the gun use my     *
left hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim:

POP-POP-POP. The Peeper pitches. Visible in the streetlight:
a red puff off his right shoulder. Headlights at end of the
block, behind me, come to life now- Baritone of a big V-8.      *
Peeper fighting for balance, keeps running.

I sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood-trail,
panting, bleeding my own trail. Lift my eyes to see the
Peeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard.
Neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus. I cross the street-

-those headlights swerve hard in front of me: Black Buick. I    *
look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel.
I bounce off like someone yanked a leash. Crumble-yell. Hands
pick me up. I fight back before I even see at whom I'm
swinging: square-jawed types, eyes hidden by Bureau derbies.    *

Welles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick.
Punches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to
write home about. My gun clatters to the ground.

     Reminded, glance at my hand: "A I N G E" in smeared ink.

Driving past Glenda's house now. No Corvette. Driving past      *
the Griffith Park `Vampires' set: addicts/crew rolling up
sleeping bags. No Corvette. Pull the address list Dandy

Pasadena. Howard's Fuck-Pad supreme: A tudor mansion with

curb. Open shades. Flashes of her. Gathering something. Check
my Hamilton, look up as: KNOCK-KNOCK on my window. Her face,
inches-close. Bags of groceries in her hands and this wry
little smile: watch me kill Hughes's new Dick with kindness.    *

     Back booth with a view of the street. Bido Lito's across the
     way. Eyeball the entrance and adjoining alley. On the table
     in front of me, mugshots: known Tommy Magdalena associates.     *
     Mostly greaser kids with low-rent juvie sheets.                 *

     Stare at that photo of Tommy.

     Okie white-trash from El Monte, shoving his way through the

     I'm up. Dump a pocketful of coins on the table. Hit the door.

     Cross fast, play the wall and the shadows close. Watch as
     Wenzel climbs steps to a flop overtop of the club. Get deeper
     into the alley: a padlocked two-car overhang at the rear.
     Grip my .45, stock down, swing, split the lock. Chain spools
     at my feet, slide inside the overhang...a car concealed under
     a tarpaulin, peel it off slow...revealing a red `32 Ford.       *

     Jimmy the door,   slide inside silent. Muffled sounds through
     the floor, some   jazz combo wailing away at Bido Lito's below.
     Voices down the   hall, male, laughter, goofball guffaws.
     George Gobel on   the tube: `Well, I'll be a dirty bird!

     Creep in a crouch, my .45 at the hip, safety off. Move toward
     the flicker at the far end of the hall. Sounds of pissing         *
     nearby, ease around a doorjamb .45 first: bedroom barren,
     dust-caked mattress, a half dozen bottles of Old Crow lie
     scattered among sash cords & used heroin spikes.

     Light from the bathroom...a pair of legs visible, female.
     Dark but pale, splayed from inside the bathroom...the right
     foot slowly moves back and forth like the heel is trying to
     gain some purchase on fast-draining life. Somebody flushes,
     zips up, steps over the two legs.

     Duck back into the hall as this Greaser stinking of pomade
     wafts past, weaving back toward the TV room.

     Inside. Move fast now. A fist-sized lump swells mid-chest,
     blossoms into my throat. I don't want to see what I know is
     there. Turn the corner:

     Club Alabam songbird Tilly Hopwell. Three breaths from death.
     A spike snapped off in her greyish, motionless left arm. Her
     right hand claws at tile. These beautiful dark eyes stare up
     at me like she was hoping for someone sooner. Throttle marks
     on her neck, one breast exposed, bra pulled down for a grope.

     I don't want to touch her face but I do...she closes her eyes
     the moment my fingertips hit. That gases my hate. Choke back
     sudden tears.

     Turn back. GREASER in the doorway, brown-bagged T-Bird hits
     the floor as he reaches for his waist -- stand and shoot him
     in the throat. Drive the .45 into his sternum like a blade
     before I fire the second-third-fourth shots. He falls/flails.     *

     sitting upright, the Deuce spun sidelong, firing M3 `Grease

     skelter under fire. Six-packs spill to the street, belly          *
     crawl, brandish .38 service snubs and pop flimsy return fire.

     Tommy jumps down, runs, rifling his jacket for clips. Wenzel
     stays atop the car -- gun my engine, split the abandoned          *
     prowlers. Wenzel looks up mid-reload as I T-bone the `Deuce'      *
     at speed. The impact rockets him rag-doll end over end before     *
     he bombs back down to the street, wet sack, multiple
     bruises/fractures/breaks...blood pooling in pints.

     Tommy wide-eyes the heap that was Wenzel. Kick my driver's        *
     side door open firing. Tommy cuts loose with that Grease-Gun,     *
     sprays wild. Crouch-move as bullets thump wreckage and whiz
     by overhead. More sirens approach. Tuck behind the front end
     of the mangled `Deuce.'

     Another salvo from the Grease-Gun skips up off the pavement       *
     in front of me. The six-packs have regrouped, start laying        *
     down fire on Tommy. Tommy running now -- I'm up on one knee,      *
     aiming, tucking into the .45: take his legs but don't kill h-     *

     -that Gray Packard materializes across the intersection in

     fire at the Packard as it continues down the street, running      *
     lights extinguished, no plates visible.

     Slouched in my front seat, watching a small flop-style motel    *
     near the beach.

</b>               Dan Wilhite.
                   (beat)
               Dispatch shot me his temporary
               address. Some beach flop he fled to
               after his wife put him out.

     Check my Hamilton: 7:32 AM. A car pulls into the parking lot.
     Two suits step out, ramrod straight, starched officious:
     Process Servers if ever I've seen them. One of them bears a
     sealed envelope as they walk to room #11 and knock. No
     answer. They knock rude. I roll down my window.

     Dan Wilhite answers in a robe: Groggy-pissed-hungover. Before
     he utters a word, he's handed the sealed envelope and the
     pair depart. Wilhite calls after, tearing open the envelope
     and reading what's inside...then rereading it.

     Gauge his reaction: ruined.

     He puts his hand on top of his head...like he's trying to
     protect it from the sky that is now falling down around him.
     Another big pause staring at nothing...then he just calmly
     walks back inside the room, closing the door behind him.

     Out of my car. Quietly hustling up to Wilhite's door: Reach
     it and hear a distinct POP -- see the flash-snap from behind

     Wilhite's service revolver a foot away from one hand, a sheet
     of paper still gripped in the other. Body half onto the bed,
     half off. Blood drains from a round wound in his temple.

     Check behind me, nobody coming- close the hotel door. Pick up
     the sheet of paper/contents of the envelope. The first word I
     see: SUBPOENA.

     Flip the Subpoena over to see his Signature: not Noonan's.
     This subpoena has been issued and signed by LA District
     Attorney Bob Gallaudet. Flip it back over, wide-eyed:

               piss without Bradley's say-so.

     A quick check of the lot. Empty. A housekeeping cart sits
     nearby. Swipe a bottle of bleach from it. Walk to Wilhite's
     Studebaker Powerhawk. Pop the trunk, return to his room.

     Move quick. Fireman's carry, dump Wilhite's body in the
     trunk. Toss his service .38 too. Pour the bottle of bleach to
     stanch the inevitable rot smell.

     Up three flights. Junior: #303: three padlocks:hinge/receiver
     hardware extending between door and jamb. Three kicks and a
     shoulder to splinter the door. Stop, look: Some kind of twine
     stretched taut, just inside the door...trip-wire. Pull my pig-
     sticker, extend it between door and jamb...see the twine
     stretching tighter -- flick the blade, snag twine, slice it.

     Stand. Put my boot into the door full. Snaps at the hinges.

     Move slow. Examine close: Eye-bolt pulley system, jerry-
     rigged around the door. Severed twine attached to the trigger
     of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level.

     Continue to look around. Sex-horror grimace: like catching
     Pop fingering Mom. Junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom.

               hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA,
               and not have it rot your mind.

     Bear traps barely hidden under sheets. Rat-traps garnished
     with razor blades across the floor. Smell rotten flowers: his
     shirt that I wore/bled-on crumpled on his pillow -- yellowed
     jizz stains cover black blood stains. Stifle a gag.

     Card table: an empty green-banded evidence bag. Gape at it.

Then I see the bookcase. Top shelf: Police manuals. Bottom
two shelves: wall-to-wall red steno-pads, all exactly the
same brand. Shock. Step over. Flip through them: tiny,
architect-neat script covers every page. The running dialogue
of a functional fucking freak:

</b><b>RECORDS/LEDGERS. SOME ENTRIES REDACTED. TRANSLATED `HH' INTO
</b><b>`HURWITZ HOLDINGS' AFTER RECOVERING MAIL. SEEMS SUSPICIOUS. BROUGHT
</b><b>TO ATTENTION OF KLEIN. BRUSHED OFF. PRESS IN SPITE OF KLEIN'S LAZINESS OR
</b><b>LACK OF INTEREST.
</b>
A hand drawn cock doodled beneath that, then below:

<b>DAVE WEARING FORM-FITTING SHIRT TODAY. HANDSOME. I WANT TO PULL IT-
</b>
-drop the steno like it might bite. Pick up another: same
drill.

<b>WELLES NOONAN WILL WIN OUT. KLEIN NOT SKILLED OR SMART ENOUGH TO

Pick up yet another, hands shaking, turn to the last page:

Now, rifle for that knife. Systemically destroy the place.
Dump the stenos in a trash can, sift for matches, strike,
watch the pads catch and floosh, feed the fire with random
paperwork, sift -- Junior's cock-obsessed doodles scribbled
by the dozen.

Under the bed now, carpet covered in rat-traps. Spring them,
clear a space. A Box: beefcake booty, gay smut mags, gay
classified ads. First-person perspective Polaroids of
Junior's stomach being kissed by the Diskant Quiff and vice-
versa.

Open a massive steamer trunk against a far wall. Arsenal:
handguns, shotguns, a surplus M-1. Dump it, kick contents.
Only interested in that knife.

     Move into his kitchenette. Check the freezer even though
     Junior is smarter than that: amyl-nitrate poppers, vodka,
     benzedrine, cocaine. Close it. Look down. STOP: indents in
     the cheap tile floor from where the refrigerator used to sit.

     Pull to see what's behind. Eyes catch the bear-trap near the
     bed as I tug: ugly-rusted-waiting. STOP part II: Contort,
     peer behind the refrigerator: a pineapple-shaped hand grenade
     duct-taped to the wall, next to a built-in safe.

<b>                         MY NARRATOR VOICE (V.O.)
</b>               The safe scared me more than all of

               installed overnight...he'd been
               working on something, planning
               something...

     Twine leads from the grenade's pin to the back of the
     refrigerator. My bolt-cutters snap it. Pull the refrigerator
     out now. The safe bolted into the drywall. Stare at it: the
     dial, the black paint-job...

<b>                                                       CUT TO:

     Loading shells into the shotgun that was atop that jello
     mold. Back into the kitchen. Exhale. BEGIN BLASTING. Massive
     noise. Six shots. Reload fast: nothing can muffle this
     clatter. SECOND VOLLEY. Eyes closed to keep chunks of drywall
     out. Gagging on gunsmoke. Rip at the safe -- something gives.
     THIRD VOLLEY. The Safe hits the floor, leaves a hole.

     Through the ringing in my ears: something that sounds like
     honks. Quick peek: Pete gone. A Black Buick with two white-
     walled FEDS up front. Then Junior gets out of the backseat...

     Scoop the freezer drugs, the stack of man-porn, the
     snapshots, and toss a whole armful into the hallway in front
     of Junior's door. Grab the green-banded evidence bag and tuck
     it under my arm. Back into the kitchenette. Turn on the gas
     but don't light the burners. Pull the grenade off the wall.
     Drag the safe to the rear of his place: the fire escape.


<b>77   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NEXT MOMENT                              77

     Out the window, on the escape, toss the evidence-bag down to
     Pete, then push the safe over the railing. Feature it almost
     crush the back of Pete's idling Cadillac. Pete jumps, yells:

     Doesn't move until I pull the pin on the pineapple, drop the
     pin down on him. He jumps back in, peels off-


<b>78   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NEXT MOMENT               78

     -Junior on the second-floor landing, heading to his place.
     Bloodshot bleary wide eyes, spun on a combo of drugs, the
     Feds herding him like a rabid dog:

     Junior knocked on his ass halfway up the last flight. Feds
     come sprinting. Screaming Junior tackles one on the way up.
     Juniors' front-door blown off. Terrified Neighbors greeted
     with images of Sodom scattered from the explosion: drugs,
     mags, dildos. The Fed that didn't get tackled picks up a
     photo: Junior kissing a hairy stomach.

     And Junior's mind snaps cleanly in-half. Crawls away growling
     like a bear caught in one of his traps.

     you away. Another Black Buick arrives. More Bureau stiffs.
     Keep moving. Looky-Loos pop up along the block, pointing. I'm
     the only one not looking back toward Junior's now flaming
     pad. The Powerhawk still another street up. Fire engines wail
     close.

     Shouts from behind now. Look back: a Bureau putz pointing my
     way -- one of the Buicks tearing up the block toward me.

     they tell me it's okay...I lean in, takes a lifetime...and
     kiss her soft until she kisses back, her mouth moving over my
     split lips, she puts her hands on my face, pulling me in.

     She feels exactly like I imagined.

     My coat comes off. Her camisole follows. We're moving toward
     a bed in back. I stop, pull back, the moonlight moves over
     her shoulders. I whisper:

<b>                         ME
</b>               ...tell me if I'm being too rough.

     Tears squeezed through smiling eyes, she kisses me even
     harder, pulls me down to her. We make love like we've never
     touched another. Everything blurs, burns down: Bradley.
     Wilhite. Tommy. Hector Junior. Ainge. She takes it all away.
     I escape into her. Hours fall. I could stay here forever...

</b>          Dwight Gillette.

She doesn't blanch.

<b>                     GLENDA BLEDSOE

          nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard.
          These beautiful, funny little kids.
              (tears she doesn't swipe)
          I dropped them off. Didn't ask any
          questions -- I believed Dwight. A
          week later I saw their pictures in
          the Post Office. A week after that
          their little bodies came in on the
          tide near San Pedro.
              (beat, tears stream)
          I'll never shake the thought that
          maybe those poor kids thought I was
          part of it. That I knew what was
          going to happen to them. So I pray
          to God that he let them look in
          when I put that knife into Dwight.

     from mine.

     She touches my quake. Two breaths with her hand on mine and
     it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear. She
     takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts. The only things
     audible: my breathing, a clock ticking. Both slowly fade out.

     Wake up quiet, look at my Hamilton. 6 AM. Sit up slow.

     Look back at her, sleeping, just stare. I lean down, kiss her

     Dark. Stay quiet. Maneuver into the kitchen. Turn on a light.
     On the table: safe open, it's contents laid-out neatly, short-
     stacks of files, $1000 in twenties. I sit, start searching
     for something else...Pete's voice behind me:

               in an `undisclosed locale.'

     I don't turn. Pete sits next to me. Sets a shotgun down.

</b>           People are gonna start lining-up to
           see you bleed, Pal.

architect-neat block printing. Find a Glenda entry:

     Shred it. Grab another file. Hyper-detailed: subscript
     clarifications, attachments, pictures, procedural notes to
     the U.S.A.W.N.: United States Attorney Welles Noonan.

     Then I see the tab of the file furthest down: BOYCE BRADLEY.
     Open it: Noonan's business card stapled to the front cover.
     Flip forward. Scan. See Bradley's name, finger tracks across
     a page. A company name: `HURWITZ HOLDINGS'

     I read it all...and feel my jaw slowly unhinge...

<b>                         ME
</b>               That's why I needed his address. I
               was trying to help him before

                   (beat, deadpan)
               He say anything else to you?

     Koenig looks back at me. Give nothing away...one gesture that
     doesn't read right and he'll know. He lets more seconds pass
     than he should. Trying to shake me.

          That's why you wanted Tommy found,
          not because he was a murder suspect
          or you were concerned that Noonan
          might tap him as a federal
          witness...you needed him to
          finalize your fucking land grab. To
          sign paperwork in place of his dead
          Dad. That's why you've got Madge
          and Lucille in custody now.
              (beat)
          Maybe I'll let your subpoena find
          me now Chief, maybe I'll walk right
          into it...the tales I could tell.

All Bradley can muster is:

<b>                    BRADLEY
</b>          How?

<b>                    ME
</b>          Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence
          teacher. His `excellent ratings'
          didn't stop him from stealing the
          Magdalena seizure and doing his own
          investigation.

<b>                    BRADLEY
</b>          Why would he investigate me?

Hand him Noonan's business card: dig the big Federal Eagle in
American Blue.

<b>                     ME
</b>          That was stapled to the cover.
              (beat)
          Why would Noonan worry about a Turd
          like me now...when a high profile
          target like you can be taken down.

Silence. I smile wide at it. Bradley, scrambling.

<b>                    BRADLEY
</b>          Where is Stemmons?

<b>                    ME
</b>          No idea. If you haven't spoken to
          Internal Affairs today, I'm sure
          they've called. Junior's apartment
          caught fire. Deeply deviant
          material inside. Round him up-
              (my angle)
          -and anyone he's got with him.

Bradley readjusts his glasses.

<b>                    BRADLEY
</b>          I'll issue an A.P.B. saying
          Stemmons is a known deviant
          targeting kindergarten children.

<b>                    ME
</b>          Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed
          Wilhite too.

Bradley's reaction: Feature the angler getting angled.

<b>                      BRADLEY
</b>          How do y-

<b>                    ME

Bradley says nothing. Then, like a klieg-light, it hits me.

<b>                    BRADLEY

          prove that Police can police
          themselves-

<b>                    ME
</b>          -so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his
          crusade and condemn your own before
          he can...Jesus Christ can you turn
          lemons to lemonade.

<b>                    BRADLEY
</b>          No Cop will testify against other

          suddenly disappeared.

<b>                     ME

               Noonan now.

<b>                         BRADLEY
</b>               No. It ensures our mutual
               destruction should you choose to
               share the contents of that Stemmons

     Back to the Powerhawk, fresh-scrubbed six-packs standing near
     it, the trunk stink ripe past the point of concealment. They
     see me, deferential nods. One squeaky wheel offers:

     staggers to his feet as Koenig steps over and delivers the
     coup de grace head-shot to Hector.

          So you get this file to battle
          Bradley with. What's Junior get in
          return?

And like he was waiting for those words: Junior lunges. I
twist to deflect but he's too fast -- feel something sink and
drag in my side. I go down, gouge/groping for my gun. Instant
trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm, fingers failing. Then a
pain like boiling oil moves through my blood.

</b>          This isn't it!

-Junior looks: that's all I need. Pull the pig-sticker off my
ankle and corkscrew it into his calf, twisting. Junior bleats
slaughtered-lamb as I reach up a wrench his gun free. Grab
his tie, pull him down as I jut his gun up under his chin and
fire two shots through the top of his head.

Haul him down dead by his tie, turn -- Koenig's gun-hand
flashes to his shoulder. Shoot him twice. He goes down
gargling `fuck'. Stand-up on me sea-legs, bad wobble/weave as
I slowly pull the knife from my side, pocket it. Feel blood
flow saturate my pant leg. This weird wooze overcomes me as I
approach Koenig.

He pulls himself into a sitting position, shaking his head.
This bemused, beaten, half-grin as he flicks blood from his
hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky.

<b>                    KOENIG

          played...

Say nothing. Keep Junior's .45 out. My intention crystal
clear: endgame. Koenig looks up, this odd squint, like a bum
about to beg for change.

<b>                         KOENIG
</b>               Give me a minute then?

     I do. Watch his hands as he removes his shoes, waiting for an
     ankle grab, his back-up piece...none comes. He sets his shoes
     aside, gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this
     short, gruff laugh...some inside joke that will die untold.

-round the corner: Glenda shaking but refusing to cry. I go
pale: what is this? Somebody to the left, look: Milteer. Look
back at Pete: tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with
a right cross.

          I say `stop' -- and cease that

Pete bludgeons me. I try to get closer to Glenda. Feel my
nose shatter. Another swing: right cheek detonates. A left
hook to take advantage of my momentum: left eye explodes.
Glenda's crying/screaming gets me madder than anything.

      Just sit and watch Glenda. Listen to her sleep: rhythmic
      breathing. The little natural smiling curl to her lips.
      Blonde hair splayed over white sheets. Touch her.

<b>                          ME (V.O.)
</b>                I haven't loved you long enough to
                leave it all behind...Too many
                enemies. Too many ways for you to
                get hurt. Too close to me...a
                decision that will haunt me the
                rest of my days...

      The Gillette knife, fold it in a kerchief, gift-wrap it to
      Glenda. Place a letter under it on the night stand:

<b>                          ME (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>                "My Heaven: the hours I had with
                you. My Hell: the years ahead,
                without. Someday I'll see you
                before you even know I'm looking."

      I stand quiet, `grief' the best word but still not enough.
      Choke back tears as I lift Pete's camera and take the black
      and white picture you've seen before.

      Put my jacket on, pull the paper out of my pocket that Pete
      planted...a TWA Airline voucher. I smile small...

      A Times vending machine: paper blazing with front page photos
      of wanted cop Dave Klein. I walk right past my old face. Past
      Cops and Feds camped out, looking for me.

<b>                           ME (V.O.)

                brand new face...nobody gives me a
                second glance...not even the cops I
                recognize.

      Up to the TWA counter: glance up at the departures board-

      I'm old. Stare at my leather-tan, once-broken face in a
      gilded mirror. The breaks occurred a lifetime ago, healed
      uneven. I start to pack my suitcases. Old files you think you
      may have seen before. An old gun you know you've seen before.
      Movements slow and steady in my advancing age...

          Me: gringo exile rich off funds

          Boyce Bradley: Lt. Governor, then a

          Welles Noonan, convicted of jury

</b>          Glenda: twenty-five years avoiding
          her name. Only a photograph,
          yellowed with years-passed,
          reminding me of everything I never
          was.
               (beat)
          Then a week-old Times at the place
          I buy coffee. Her picture sees me
          before I realize she's looking. Her
          Face eternal-beautiful...

Put her photo in my chest pocket. Push the week-old Times
into a waste-basket: a Pan-Am ticket to LA underneath.

<b>                    ME (V.O.)
</b>          ...and it asked me to revoke our
          time apart, redeem it...tell her
          anything...tell her everything...

I stand, shatter the mirror that reminds me of how long. And
as I step out, an old man twenty-five years too late, and my
MGM-handsome, 1958 face smiles back at me through the shards.
