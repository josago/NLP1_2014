<b>               CREDITS SEQUENCE: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS
</b>               An unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal
               pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve-motors.
               THOMAS CRAWFORD works on it: in his 40s, well-dressed but in
               disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt.
               Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and
               strange.
               He sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and
               drops it into a slot at the top of the device.
               His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball -
               - as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg-
               style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles -
               - then missing a leap and clattering across the work-table.
               Eyes on the device, Crawford's hand traps the ball.
               He stays still, analyzing.
               He selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal-
               working and electronics tools. Makes a miniscule adjustment
               to a single joint. Drops in another ball.
               It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down.
               Crawford doesn't react.   Just studies the machine.
               Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful
               woman in her mid-30s.
               His wife.

</b>
               JENNIFER CRAWFORD is just reaching orgasm -
               - with ROB NUNALLY: mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish.
               They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. And
               then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls
               off her - slowly coming back to earth.
               Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and
               gratitude and satisfaction on her face -
               - darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear.
               She is, after all, having an affair.

<b>               INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               Crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless,
               expressionless.

               He takes a deep breath and checks his watch.   Then he stands,
               removing the glasses.

               We now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment
               related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets
               take off from an industrial airstrip.

               Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk
               drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private
               bathroom.

               He gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then
               puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk.

               He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks
               like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card.

               He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on
               the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby.
               Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays:
               dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal.

               TINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway.

                           Yep.

               She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle.
               Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and
               grabbing his jacket -
               - which knocks over the bottle.   It skitters across the desk,
               liquor spilling.
               Crawford just walks out past Tina.

               The twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet
               is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor.

               EXECUTIVES in suits cluster around work-boards covered with
               photographs and diagrams of a crash site.
               They look up, falling silent, as Crawford comes in carrying
               the X-ray. A few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this
               is not a man who skips a shave.
               But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding
               the X-ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it:

</b>                            It's here.

               He hands a startled Investigator the film and strides off
               toward the giant open doors out to the airfield.
               His foot knocks a piece of the carefully-laid-out wreckage in
               passing; it clatters across the concrete, but Crawford
               doesn't slow or look back.

               Rob is still in the bed, naked under the sheet - watching
               Jennifer adjust the straps of her bathing suit.

               She looks at him, surprised.    Smiles, comes to sit beside
               him. Gently:

</b>                            We go out to dinner - we might never

               Beat.   Rob nods.

               He gropes for words, but it's too big and he relents - scales
               back, sighing:

</b>                            ...at least see where you live.

               She regards him tenderly, feeling the same reckless yearning.
               But also fear. She rubs his hair.

               A black Porsche speeds down a quiet street near the beach,

               Crawford gets out, goes to a pay phone. He puts his cell
               phone on top of it, drops in some change and dials.

               He just stands there, taking it all in. The unmade bed, the
               ripped-open condom packet, the clothes on the floor.

               houses in the late-afternoon light.
               She goes up the driveway of the Crawfords' stark mordern home.
               Across the street, MR. GIFFORD is playing catch with his
               GRANDSON. He waves to Jennifer.
               She waves back, friendly but distracted, on her way to the

               Cold. Elegant. Metal planters with bamboo trees. Glass

               In a corner is another of Crawford's Rube Goldbergs - this
               one the size of a refrigerator. On a coffee table in the
               center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball-bearings.
               Jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and -
               - freezes, startled.
               Crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer
               "disarray", he is calm and focused.

               He shakes his head.     Frayed and worn, she sighs.

                           dinner.
               He watches her turn and head for the kitchen.          To her back:

               happening at last.

               Jennifer winces, feeling some sympathy.     Preparing herself to
               turn and end it, to grow, to move on.

               Crawford is holding a semi-automatic pistol, aimed at her
               face. Very still.
               The gunshot explodes out of the muzzle - bright, harsh, loud.

               Crawford stands, tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic
               curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand. The
               hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove.
               He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing
               from the floor. He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way
               to Jennifer.
               He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in
               a small pool of blood, eyes and mouth open.
               The doorbell rings.

               Gifford leans on the frosted-glass panel next to the door -
               hands cupped around his eyes, trying to see in.

               He calmly aims up at the frosted-glass transom and fires
               three times - watching Gifford fling himself away.
               Crawford collects the shell casings, wipes them, drops them
               back on the floor.
               Peeling off the rubber gloves, he crosses to the fireplace
               and throws them into the flames. They curl and blacken.

               Helicopters overhead, SWAT teams setting up. Nearby houses
               have been emptied, gawking NEIGHBORS and media vans moved
               back to a block away.
               UNIFORM COPS pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan
               rolls through. It pulls up by the SWAT Command Truck.
               ROB NUNALLY gets out, surveying the scene. The guy who spent
               his afternoon with Jennifer Crawford in the hotel is an

               Nunally is standing by the open trunk of his sedan, wearing a
               Kevlar vest now - putting on his shoulder-holster over it.
               Into his cell-phone:

               Nunally grimaces, shuts his phone, shaking his head. But
               then he turns - with the SWAT Commander and everyone else -
               - as Crawford's front door unlocks and opens a few inches.
               Nunally considers this, looks at the SWAT COMMANDER.

               He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk
               for his back-up gun. He tucks it into the back of his belt,
               concealed under the jacket.
               He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house.
               The spectators fall silent.    Radios crackle and hiss as he
               heads up the driveway.

               Crawford watches Nunally's silhouette appear on the frosted
               glass, from across the living room.

               doorway.

               Nunally is confused; Crawford gestures at the flood-lit lawn
               outside. Nunally glances back, sees the SWAT teams and -
               down the street - the distant barricades, the media.
               He nods, steps in and lets the door shut.     Careful silence.

               pool of blood where Jennifer fell. Plays it cool.

               Nunally frowns, wary.
               Crawford moves to the coffee table in the center of the room,
               holds his gun out over it.

               Crawford gestures to a chair across the room - by the foyer
               door, near Nunally.

                           Then you can "pay more attention" to
                           what I'm saying.
               Nunally studies Crawford...and the gun, hovering above the
               coffee table. Looking for a trick, a catch. But there isn't
               one. If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be
               standing in the open center of the room.

               - then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster.
               Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly -
               the two men cautiously set down their guns -
               - and step away.   Crawford smiles.
               Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. Begins to edge
               forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or
               having another weapon. But Crawford stays absolutely still.

               back wall of the alcove - which he can now see.
               There's a big framed black-white photograph: a portrait of
               Jennifer Crawford.

               Nunally fumbles for his walkie-talkie, rushing past Crawford
               toward the alcove -
               - kneeling by Jennifer, who lies, face-up in a red puddle -

                           ambulance up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW!
               Nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse - looking in
               her open, vacant eyes for some sign -

               Nunally desperately starts C.P.R., his hands getting bloody.
               He stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then -
               - as Crawford slowly approaches from the living room,
               standing behind Nunally. Cold.

                           the femoral artery. It's on the inner
                           surface of the upper thigh. If you
                           put your fingers - you know, right up

               face. Crawford reels backward with Nunally -
               - the two of them falling with Nunally on top, beating
               Crawford furiously, cursing -
               - as SWAT COPS burst in, grabbing Nunally, dragging him back -
               knocking into PARAMEDICS trying to get to Jennifer -
               - Nunally kicking, flailing, spitting at Crawford - who's put
               face-down on the floor, to get cuffed.
               Nunally pulls free from the SWAT cops, distraught, angry -
               going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder-
               holster, struggling to regain control.

               Nunally whirls - everyone freezing, breathless, falling
               silent.
               The Paramedics kneeling around Jennifer work -
               - as Crawford lies on the floor, staring at his wife. Like
               she's a machine that defied astronomical odds and refused to
               behave according to his calculations.

               Jennifer's stretcher is loaded into an ambulance, doors
               slamming shut and sirens kicking on -
               - as Crawford, cuffed behind his back, is pushed into the
               back seat of a police car. His eyes on the ambulance as it
               pulls away, carrying his wife.

               A DETECTIVE uses a pencil to lift Crawford's gun from the

               Nunally stands back, watching the COPS and TECHNICIANS work
               the scene - lost in his thoughts, shaken.

               chaos outside.

<b>               INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

               The alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news
               and traffic -
               - but the narrow futon bed is already empty.
               WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit
               by a solitary lamp.
               He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale
               but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern
               Oklahoma State College.
               He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he
               goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt
               and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop
               screen: rental listings for a new apartment.

<b>               TIME CUT
</b>               The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor
               and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on a
               length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters.
               Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves.
               The radio chatters.    Willy knots a tie in his crisp white
               collar.

<b>               TIME CUT
</b>               Willy methodically packs legal folders from last night's
               "homework" into his big, battered briefcase. He has to work
               to stuff all the files in.
               He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at
               his cuffs. Uncaps a pen, leans over a one-sentence letter
               waiting on the desk. Reads it over.
               As he signs, we glimpse:
                   - hereby give notice that I will be resigning my
                   position at the District Attorney's Office as of

               Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy
               briefcase - goes to shut off the light and open the door -
               - which swings about six inches, then clonks into something.
               Willy grimaces.   Peeks out, goes to pound on a wall.

               Silence. He sighs.    Shuts the door and presses a button near
               the light-switch.
               There's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly
               rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond
               the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves.
               He presses the garage-door-opener button again, and hurries
               across the apartment to duck out under the closing door.

               Willy straightens and takes a breath, re-settling his suit
               jacket with an irritable glance at his landlady's car, parked
               sloppily next to the garage, blocking his door.
               As he walks away, down the alley, we rise up to reveal the
               hazy sprawling landscape of L.A. - and the towers of
               Downtown, rising ahead of Willy like Oz.

               Willy hesitates. Looks around: he's never been here. Flags,
               wood panelling, leather furniture, windows overlooking the
               city. Finally Lobruto looks up, takes Willy in.

</b>                           Good for you, double-oh-seven.
                                  (Signaling the Bailiff)
                           Let's see what public service is
                           offering you by way of a send-off:

<b>                                        BAILIFF
</b>                           The State of California Versus Thomas
                           Crawford.
               The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to the
               Judge - glancing back and noticing Nunally, whose eyes bore
               into him, haunted and burning.
               Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns to
               lean past his P.D. and watch Willy hastily skim the file.

</b>                           Mr. Crawford, you've been charged with
                           section 664 slash 187 of the
                           California Penal Code: Attempted
                           Murder, with additional allegations of
                           Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal
                           Code section 245 dash A2, with Great
                           Bodily Injury, P.C. Section 12022.07.

                           Do you waive further reading of the
                           complaint and complete statement of

                           myself.
               Willy looks up from the file - startled.

<b>                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
</b>                           Do you have a problem with your
                           appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford?

<b>                                        CRAWFORD
</b>                           No. I just want to do it myself.     I
                           believe it's within my rights.

<b>                                        P.D.
</b>                           Your honor, if I could have a moment
                           with my client -

</b>                           I'm not your client. Try and keep up,
                           would you?
               The P.D. shuts up, taken aback. The Judge considers
               Crawford, thoughtful, then turns to Willy.

<b>                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
</b>                           Do the People have an objection or a
                           comment for the record, Mr. Slocum?
               Willy hesitates, held by Crawford's strange, amused gaze.
               Shakes it off:

<b>                                        WILLY

                           weapon and a signed confession. I
                           really think Mr. Crawford needs a
                           competent attorney to - frankly -
                           negotiate a plea.
               Crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an
               imaginary bow-tie. Willy self-consciously touches where
               Crawford indicated on his own collar, straightens his clip-
               on.

                           Attorney's office can shift another

               Willy hesitates, irritated. Looks through the file again.
               Checks Crawford - waiting, polite.

               Willy, in his tux, comes out of a staircase and stops.   Rob
               Nunally is waiting by Willy's parked car.

               Willy takes him in - wary, seeing an edge of anger and fear
               beneath the tough controlled cop manner.

                           you've got one foot out the door, and
                           you're wiping the rest of us off the

               Nunally is silent - frustrated. The concrete walls and

               He shuts the phone. Takes a moment, looking around again at
               where he is. Absently tugs at his tie and vest, lets the

               Controlled chaos. A week's work has emptied the shelves and
               cleared the surfaces, but the file-cabinet drawers are all
               half-open: Willy sorts folders, neatly marking and packing
               them. White "trans-file" storage boxes are piled all over.

               Willy sourly gestures to a chair; checks the label as the

                           I sent this box: to the Defendant, at

               Messenger holds out a clipboard. Willy reluctantly signs.
               As the Messenger leaves, Willy cuts the tape and takes out a
               folder. Opens it:
               Crawford has scrawled NO in red marker across the top sheet.
               Willy turns to the next page.     A big red NO across that, too.
               Pulls out more documents - flips through: NO - NO - NO - NO -
               red letters wriggling across the typed pages, like flip-book
               animation.
               Beat.   Disturbed, he picks up the phone, dials.

               to put away his papers.

               Willy looks at him, slightly taken aback.   He didn't know; it
               wasn't in the confession.
               As he considers whether it makes a difference - he notices
               Crawford watching, enjoying. Willy shuts his briefcase.

               Willy nods, allowing the jury time on this. He checks a note-
               card, glances at Crawford. Considers his options.

                           intended to kill?

               Willy gives Judge Robinson an I-told-you-so shrug.     Turns to
               Dr. Kang.

               Local news on the TV: Willy pushing past media outside the
               courthouse; official photo of Nunally; footage from the
               standoff at Crawford's.
               The sound is low, and Nunally isn't watching. He's sitting
               on the edge of the bed...looking down at his gun, in his
               hands.
               A knock on the door "wakes" him. Beat. He sets the gun
               aside, goes to peek out the curtains. Lets Willy in.

               He uncomfortably watches Willy glance around at the half-
               empty liquor bottle, the mismatched suitcases and paper bags
               full of balled-up clothes. And the gun on the bed.

</b>                           This isn't an accomplice sort of guy.
               He slows. Looking across the room at the big Rube Goldberg
               device. As he moves toward it:

</b>                           This is a...guy who likes to show off.
               He examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the
               clutter of metal and wires and motors.
               Checks Marchand - who shakes his head.

               Willy grimaces.   Fuming, relentless:

<b>                                        WILLY
</b>                           It's a physical object. It can't just
                           vanish. We're missing something -
                           some step in the story.
               He begins walking through the crime, "the stations of the
               cross" - re-enacting it, starting from the front door,
               methodical, reciting it to himself:

<b>                                        WILLY
</b>                           The neighbor sees her get home. He's
                           already inside. She lets herself in.
                           A minute or two later: blood-pattern
                           says she's standing over there - he's
                           somewhere around here.
               Willy stands where Crawford was.     Raises a finger-gun.

               As Willy goes to where Jennifer fell:

</b>                           But then he carries her back there.
                           Why?
               Willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood:

                           confess. When she's alone with the
                           cop.
               Willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood,
               the discarded paramedic-supply-wrappers.

               Willy nods, comes out - crosses to the foyer:

</b>                           Crawford shouts, "Leave us alone" and
                           fires three more rounds: boom-boom-
                           boom.

</b>                           So everybody knows he's dangerous -
                           and she might still be alive.

                                  (Beat)
                           Now he's got about ten minutes.
               And that's it. He stands there with the imaginary gun in his
               hand. Looking around. Trying to think like Crawford.
               He can't.

<b>                                        MARCHAND
</b>                           I'm sorry, Willy.
               Willy won't respond - because accepting the apology means
               admitting he's got nothing left.

<b>               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER

               It's night. The house is empty. Except for Willy, turning
               on lights as he gets to each room, turning them off as he
               leaves.

               Studying framed photos: Jennifer - now and then with Crawford -
               in Italy, Bermuda, Colorado. Always a bit posed and formal

               Willy wanders through Jennifer's spacious dressing room.

               He idly surveys the vanity, cluttered with cosmetics, skin-
               care products. Lifts her perfume, sniffs.

                           Or a bus to come, or a plane to go
               Notices a storage box on the floor, left partly-open in the
               search. He shifts the lid aside.

               Jennifer Crawford lies with her head wrapped in gauze, eyes
               shut, plastic tubing down her throat held in place with tape.
               Willy sits beside her bed, reading Dr. Seuss:

               The room where Jennifer and Nunally met. Cleaned-up now,
               anonymous, empty. Willy stands looking at it.
               There's nothing to see. He grimaces, nods - heads out, past

               A faux-Tudor Hancock Park dining room.   Wealthy, but lived
               in.
               JUDGE LEWIS GARDNER, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart-
               type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long table,
               wearing a worn and gravy-splattered apron. Platters
               circulate in both directions among Nikki's older siblings
               (BURTON and SANDRA), their spouses, their children.
               Willy sits next to Nikki, who is high-stylish despite the
               fact that she's dressed "casual."

               Nikki stops. Refusing to look around.     Ashamed at losing
               control, turns back to her food:

               Empty.   Dark.   Willy lets himself in.
               He looks for the light-switch - finds only a complex
               computerized dimmer-panel. He tries it.
               Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters.
               He can't get any other pre-sets to work.
               The crime scene is creepy, lit like that. The dried blood is
               black. Shadows stretch up the walls, strange.
               Willy grimaces, moves through it - sees another panel by the
               French doors to the garden. Goes over -
               - and jumps back, startled -

               doors and Nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard.

               Willy watches Nunally stalk out through the big, strangely-
               lit room. The front door opens, and slams.
               A little worried, Willy takes a deep breath.       Gets to work.
               He still has three days to break this open.
               Walking through the crime again.
               Playing it out in his mind. Standing in different places,
               getting different perspectives.
               Willy stands in the alcove.    Looking around.
               There's something here.     But he can't get it.
               His eye falls on the Rube Goldberg device.       Moves closer,
               peering into the mechanism.
               Turns away: no gun. But now he's facing the big wooden bowl
               of ball-bearings, sitting out in the middle of the room on
               the coffee table.
               Hide in plain sight.
               He walks over - pushes his fingers in, feels around.
               Nope. He sighs. Takes a ball-bearing, rolls it in his hand.
               Goes to the device - drops the ball in the slot.
               The machine is amazing. The ball rolls and leaps and
               clatters - lights flash, elevators rise and fall, at one
               point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air - then it
               spirals out of sight and reappears somewhere unexpected -
               - until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails
               across the living room -
               - to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table.
               Willy grimaces.   This guy is really good.

                           it would go down - and he didn't leave
                           any loose ends.

               Willy uses the remote. On the TV, in black-and-white:
               Jennifer and Nunally come out of their room and head for the
               pool - indistinct figures zip jerkily in and out of rooms on
               fast-forward -
               - until he slows it: Crawford comes to let himself in.

                           He was there. Why?
               Marchand watches over Willy's shoulder.    Shrugs.

                           needs to get himself all worked up.
               Willy stares at the grainy black-and-white figure emerging
               from the room, walking away down the corridor. Unconvinced:

               Marchand gets his jacket, pulls it on.

                           shit.
               Willy says nothing.    Runs the tape back and then slow-motions
               it forward again.
               Marchand goes out.    Leaving Willy alone, watching Crawford.

<b>               INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - VERY LATE THAT NIGHT
</b>
               Willy stands over crime scene photos and diagrams spread out
               on his narrow futon. "Walking the scene" again, on paper.
               The whole apartment is an array of law books, notes,
               exhibits, marked-up depositions.
               He's staring at evidence he's already stared at a hundred
               times.
               He grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull
               moan rising into a yell -
               - as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper -
               throwing books - tearing up printouts - pulling out drawers,
               emptying them, smashing them on the desk -
               - yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse, his shabby
               garage apartment is trashed, and he's sitting, exhausted, in
               his chair.
               There's a knock on the door.
               Willy frowns, checking the clock: it's two-thirty a.m.   He
               goes to open it -
               - revealing Nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted
               shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to
               Jennifer Crawford.

                           the blade, inside the lawn-mower.
               Before Willy can say anything - Nunally walks away.
               Willy doesn't move.   Watching the tormented cop disappear
               down the alley.

               Willy - in a clean suit and crisp suit, carrying his
               briefcase - hurries through, paying no attention to the
               SECRETARIES and OTHER D.D.A.s who watch like he's on his way
               to his own execution.
               At his office door, he gestures for Mona to come in with him.
               Surprised, she gets up - taking with her an envelope with a
               messenger-receipt taped to the front.

               Mona studies Willy - then accepts it's don't-ask-don't-tell,
               hands him her number. Willy nods, grateful.
               Turning for the door, she remembers the envelope in her hand.

               He takes it, and as she leaves, checks the return address:
               Wooton Sims.
               Willy grimaces, opens it. Inside are an airline ticket to
               Chicago - first class - and a handwritten note, on Wooton
               Sims stationery:

<b>               INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               Willy steps off the elevator, into a crowd of REPORTERS AND
               SPECTATORS outside the courtroom.
               He's startled for a moment: it's worse than he expected - the
               dense buzz of talk in the marble corridor and all the eyes
               tracking him like he's walking into an arena - a freakshow
               performer -
               - but he doesn't slow, ignoring the comments and questions,
               avoiding eye contact -
               - until he sees Nunally by the courtroom doors, his eyes
               fixed on Willy.
               Willy meets Nunally's gaze...moving on, giving back nothing.
               Nunally watches Willy disappear into the courtroom, stares at
               the closing doors - uncertain, on edge. Lost, no matter
               which way this goes.

               Mr. Gifford, the Crawford's neighbor, is on the stand.   Willy
               questions him, standing by the Prosecution Table.
               Behind him, the court is standing-room-only. REPORTERS,
               SKETCH ARTISTS, SPECTATORS. Nunally, sitting near the front.
               Lobruto, standing at the back.
               Crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with
               dense scribble.

               his cell-phone out from under some papers. To where he can
               get it easily.
               Looks back up at Crawford.   Smiles slightly.

               Willy and Crawford turn to the Judge.

               The Judge nods.
               Willy nods down. Trying to focus. He's got nothing, and
               everyone in the room knows it. He can hear it, he can feel
               it. There's a restless, hungry edge to the crowded
               courtroom.
               He stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone.
               Next to it: the first class ticket and Nikki's note.
               Willy glances back at the gallery. Nunally's eyes burn into
               him. In the back: Lobruto frowns, concerned.

               Crawford studies Willy, curious.

               Willy's fingertip hovers over the cell phone keypad.       Press,
               and a path is chosen. Possibly for life.
               Next to the cell-phone, the ticket and the note.       See you
               tomorrow.
               Nunally sits forward.    Lobruto is watching intently.
               Willy doesn't move.

               Willy won't look up.
               Nunally stares, agonized.
               Willy grimaces slightly, as if he feels his soul burning up,
               turning to ash and blowing away -
               - nods, closing the cell phone, sliding it under Nikki's
               note. Shuts the briefcase. Looks at the Judge.

               - as Nunally gets up, furious - stalks to the doors, slams
               out.

               Uproar.   The Judge bangs his gavel -

</b>                            - and the Defendant is free to go.
               Crawford gives the Judge a gentlemanly bow of the head.
               Willy begins to pack his papers into the briefcase.   Refusing
               to look up.
               The Judge and the Bailiff might be saying other things, but
               no one is listening - SPECTATORS swarm up the aisles, out to
               the hallway - and the Court starts to close down.
               Crawford comes over to Willy, holds out a hand.
               Willy looks him in the eye.   Doesn't move.   Crawford shrugs.

               He winks, and heads up the aisle.
               As Willy watches Crawford go out the doors into a clamor of
               lenses, hand-held mikes, white-hot halogen glare and flashes -
               - he hears a buzzing noise. Looks down at his briefcase,
               moves the papers aside: his cell phone is vibrating.
               Willy stares at it, as if he'd forgotten the thing could be
               used for an incoming call.
               The caller ID reads: WOOTON SIMS.   He picks up -

               Willy turns.    Shocked.    Screams and shouting in the corridor.

               - into the echoing chaos of the corridor - trying to move in

               - shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered
               around a figure lying on the floor.
               Willy pushes closer, until he catches glimpses of:
               Nunally.   Lying on the marble floor. His gun in his lifeless
               fingers.   Blood all over, from his head.
               Willy stops pushing. Won't let himself look away - the
               screams and commotion around him retreating into a numb blur.

               gawking at the body or averting their eyes -

               Pleased.   Triumphant.

               Jennifer is curled into a fetal position, despite the tubes
               and wires.
               Willy sits by her bed. Still in his suit from court, the
               jacket off, the tie loose.
               He's been there a while.   But now he speaks.

                            Or what I should have done. I really

                            Somehow in the...process. And if I
                            did, I'm sorry. That's all. I just -

                            Anyway.
               He feels stupid. Takes a breath.     Looking at her pale,
               drawn, comatose face.
               He stands, goes to get his jacket, lying folded on a table by
               the door. Pulls it on, settles the shoulders, tugs at his
               cuffs. Gets his briefcase.

               The Resident tucks his flashlight in a pocket, draws a pin

               The Resident ignores him. Pricks her forehead - her chin -
               her big toe. Each time she twitches. He runs his thumb
               along the sole of Jennifer's bare foot. It arches up.

                           can.
               Willy nods, grateful. As the Resident heads out, Willy sits
               by Jennifer's bed - protective, intent.

               Crawford comes in through the lobby: rested, well-dressed.   A
               free man. He slows, surprised -
               - seeing Willy come off the elevators. Willy hasn't left
               Jennifer's bedside. He's in the same suit and carrying his
               briefcase from the courthouse.

               Enjoys it.

               Beat.   Willy winks.    He goes past Crawford and out the doors.
               Crawford doesn't move - except to turn and watch Willy.
               Uncertain, for the first time since we've met him.

               Willy - still unshaved, unslept, in yesterday's suit - comes
               off the elevator, fishing out ID as he passes a RECEPTIONIST:

               - going directly to the key-card slot by the glass double-
               doors to the rest of the floor. He swipes his card and pulls
               the handle -
               - but it stays locked.     Willy swipes his card again.   No go.

               As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one of
               a half-dozen ASSOCIATES trailing in the wake of BOB WOOTON.
               They all carry expensive business luggage, except Wooton -
               who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older.

               Willy goes toward the glass doors as Wooton comes through -
               nodding deferentially to the boss, semi-apologetic:

               Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don't take long.
               She nods as Wooton and the team continue to the elevators -
               staying back by the glass doors to talk with Willy:

                            woman's life!
               The doors begin to close. Willy stands facing the cluster of
               lawyers in expensive suits, their expressions ranging from
               pity to contempt -
               - except Nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and
               defensive anger.
               As the doors shut across them.
               Willy doesn't move.     Confused, humiliated, frustrated.
               He turns when a bunch of OTHER LAWYERS emerge from the
               offices, ready to act as bouncers. People gawk from behind
               the glass doors.
               Beat.   Willy holds up his palms.

               Willy runs down the stairs furiously -
               - the clanging alarm, several floors above now, a little
               fainter.
               He suddenly stops - clinging to the railing, bent over.    He
               sways, dizzy, gasping -
               - backs up until he's against the concrete wall. Presses
               himself against. Listening to his own ragged breathing.
               Scared out of his mind.

               Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated,

               Crawford is carefully preparing an elegant, solitary meal.
               Music plays on his state-of-the-art sound system.
               He stops, noticing a pair of Jennifer's reading glasses,
               folded up by a note-pad and pen next to the telephone. He
               picks them up. Stylish, feminine.
               He goes to the trash, steps on the pedal to flip open the

</b>
               A Sikorsky S-76 Medevac chopper is preparing to take off,
               very loud and windy.
               Through the open doorway and the thick windows, we can
               glimpse Crawford sitting beside Jennifer, who is strapped on
               to a gurney. She's connected to life-support equipment.
               The MED TECH is outside, checking a few last supplies and
               giving Crawford a moment alone with his wife.
               Crawford moves. He may be whispering to her.    Or adjusting
               her pillow. Hard to tell.
               As he climbs out of the chopper -
               - he sees Willy across the roof, arguing with Dr. Lunt, who
               is skimming the court documents, shaking his head.
               Crawford, curious, walks toward the two men.

               Dr. Lunt hands Crawford the court order. As Crawford reads
               them, Lunt and Willy shout over the helicopter engine:

<b>                                        DR. LUNT
</b>                           This orders him not to take her off
                           life support! He's not! We can't
                           stop the man from -

               He looks at Crawford: reading - amused, thoughtful.

                           know why she's like this!
               Lunt hesitates, feeling a tiny edge of doubt.
               Crawford checks his watch.   Looks into Willy's eyes -
               - then gestures for Willy to join him, and turns back to walk
               across the pad to the helicopter. Climbs in.
               Willy stares, stunned.
               Lunt looks at him: case closed. The rotors whirl faster,
               engine noise rising to a scream.
               From the open chopper doorway, Crawford looks at Willy again
               and gestures for him to get on.
               Willy doesn't know how to react.   Slowly, he starts to walk
               toward the helicopter.

               Willy bends, coming to the door - wind-whipped, flinching.
               Crawford holds out a hand to help him in.
               Willy doesn't move.   The PILOT glances back.
               Crawford's eyes are locked with Willy's.
               Willy stares at Crawford, scared. But unable to back down
               from the crude, plain challenge. Which Crawford is clearly
               counting on.
               Angry, at himself, Willy climbs in without taking Crawford's
               hand. As he nervously figures out how to buckle himself in -

               lifeless in his.

</b>                           No.     Come on, Jennifer.    Fight back.
               Tears well up in Willy's eyes, but he struggles against them -
               feeling Crawford's gaze, refusing him the satisfaction.

               But she's gone. He stares down. Mourning her. Letting his
               grief slowly burn into rage. He gently reaches up and closes
               her eyes.
               Then he looks up at Crawford, who smiles sympathetically.

                           anything. The machine went down.
                           Anybody asks - you'll have to tell
                           them. What you saw.

                           That's really kind of perfect, isn't
                           it?
               Willy stares into his eyes. Cold.        Then he looks away.    Out
               the window, into the sun-glare.

               The garage door is open, letting in daylight. We can see the
               alley especially well, because there are only empty hangers
               on the clothes-bar, and the cinderblock shelves have been
               taken apart, stacked on the floor.
               Willy is packing.    He's wearing jeans, an old t-shirt.
               He carries a heavy pile of legal textbooks out to the trash
               bins, throws them away.

               Willy heads back in, starts to pack again.

               Lobruto nods. Respecting his pain.     Shrugs, accepts the
               decision, with regret.
               Willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing.
               Lobruto starts to leave.    But from the alley door:

                           with attempted murder.
               Willy doesn't respond.    Keeps packing.
               Lobruto goes out.
               After a moment, Willy stops.    Looking up.   Something turning
               over in his mind.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

               Lobruto is walking toward his car when Willy steps out of the
               garage and calls after him:

</b>                           We can still get him.    We can take him

                           shooting her - doesn't matter. He
                           fired a gun and caused her death, and
                           that's murder.

                           him with murder. Right?
               Lobruto nods. On the fence, but seeing it now.         Impressed
               with the young man's fervor, and his logic.
               But he shakes his head.

               Crawford is building a new Rube Goldberg device, tools and
               parts laid out precisely on a table.

               Crawford stands, taking off the glasses -

               Silence. Crawford studies Willy's eyes, over the muzzle of
               the gun between them.

               He has backed himself into a corner, and he's getting scared.
               Because all of a sudden the threat he came to fake Crawford
               out with -
               - is starting to seem like his only way out.
               Even Crawford sees it. In Willy's eyes. The uncertain edge
               of the idea. He could just do it. End the game. Blow
               Crawford's brains all over the wall.

</b>                           It's still not evidence, Willy.
                           There's no prints left by now.
                           Nothing ties that gun to me.
               Willy smiles, slow...    Enjoying himself, at last.

                           all those eggs.

</b>                           Those what?
               Willy nods to himself, going to the wooden bowl of ball-
               bearings - selecting one, carrying it to the Rube Goldberg
               machine:

<b>                                        WILLY
</b>                           With all those little cracks and weak
                           places. Like Nunally. Shooting
                           himself, right there in the
                           courthouse. I didn't think he was
                           going to do that. Did you?

                           No.
               Studying the complex device, toying with Crawford:

</b>                           I mean, we all knew he was going to
                           fall apart sooner or later. That was
                           part of your plan, right? Like a bank
                           shot, on a pool table: you kill your
                           wife - and destroy her lover. With
                           one bullet.
                                  (Turns)
                           Well: four bullets, actually. Right?
               Crawford frowns.   Trying to see what Willy's getting at.

<b>                                                       INTERCUT QUICK FLASHBACKS:
</b>               Crawford fires at Jennifer -

<b>                                        WILLY (V.O.)
</b>                           Then three more out the front of the
                           house, to get some attention.
               - and fires three times at the transom.

                           to begin - you have to reload
                           Nunally's gun.

</b>               Crawford pushes new bullets into the clip -

</b>                           I mean, you don't want him wondering
                           where the hell four bullets went,
                           considering he never fired his gun
                           that night.

               - and slides the clip back into the gun, pleased.
               Willy nods, thinking it out.   Sure of himself.
               He sets the ball-bearing into the slot at the top of the
               machine -

<b>                                         WILLY
</b>                           And I'm betting you didn't worry about
                           fingerprints.

               Crawford reacts.
               CLOSE: Crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the clip.
               Willy lets the ball go - watching it begin rolling down the
               ornate tracks.

<b>                                        WILLY
</b>                           I mean, why would you? Nobody's going
                           to be looking at his gun.

               The ball tumbles and clatters - flipping and clicking through
               the ingenious, precise, heartless machinery -

<b>                                        WILLY
</b>                           And sooner or later, life goes on,
                           those four incriminating bullets would
                           get used, and be gone forever.

               - and Crawford is recognizing, slowly, his one mistake.
               The gun in Nunally's limp dead fingers, glimpsed on the
               marble courthouse floor, through the crowd.

<b>                                        WILLY (V.O.)
</b>                           Except Nunally only fired one of those
                           bullets. Into himself.

               Willy turns from the machine -
               - which continues clattering and working, beside him.

                           with your fingerprints on them - Tom.
                           In this clip.

               He holds the gun up.     Savoring Crawford's growing fear.
               They can hear a car rolling up the driveway. Red and blue
               lights sweep the frosted glass by the front door.

<b>                                        WILLY
</b>                           Everybody has a weak spot, right?
                           Some place they break.

               Without looking, Willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a
               fraction of an inch on the floor -
               - as the ball catapults out - sailing across the living room
               in a perfect, graceful arc -
               - that misses the bowl.

               Outside, the police car doors open and then slam.
               Crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the
               coffee-table and across the floor toward him.
               Crawford doesn't move.     Trying to focus.    His mind working.
               The ball comes to rest against Crawford's shoe.
               The doorbell rings.

               Crawford looks up.     Meeting Willy's eyes.
               Smiling slightly, Willy tucks Nunally's gun into his belt and
               puts his hands in the air.
               And gives Crawford a wink.
               Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and
               fear curdling in his eyes -
               - as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.
