          The CAMERA STARTS FROM THE CEILING, pointing straight
          down, overlooking a table of twenty-five people dressed
          in business casual, pretending to have a good time at
          lunch in. this cookie-cutter crappy restaurant.
          At the end of the table, a bowl of spinach dip is in.

          there was a certain amount of inter-
          office pressure to go to Appleby's and
          sit at a table of twenty-five with my
          boss Janice presiding at the head even
          though she's too tight to pick up the
          bill. Which meant, the poor bastard
          waiting on us had to split the check
          twenty-four ways -- everyone contributing
          to Rochelle's free meal -- surf and turf,
          no less -- don't do us any favors,
          Rochelle. Anyway, I ate a plate of
          extreme nachos and then polished off a
          bowlful of spinach dip pretty much single-
          handedly...

          A sharply dressed man, MR. X, wearing a dark .Armani suit,
          enters a skyscraper through the lobby. He's a shade
          taller than most of the office workers who are coming and
          going.

<b>          INT. LOBBY - DAY
</b>
          He heads to an elevator and presses a button for the top
          floor.
          And as his finger presses the button, just where the
          thumb meets the forefinger, we see a TATTOO of a three-
          headed dog.
          Soon...

</b>
          .the doors open again and he finds himself in an
          opulent corridor -- sleek and expensively designed.
          Only one office is at the end of the hall.
          Expressionless, he makes his way toward it. Without
          knocking, he steps inside...

<b>          INT. PUJA'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          .an office fit for a king. Or a queen. Because behind
          a glass desk sits a beautiful Indian woman dressed
          traditionally in a serape, with a red bindi on her
          forehead, the holy third eye. Her name is PUJA.
          Mr. X sits in the single chair opposite her.
          After a moment, Puja looks up.

<b>          PUJA
</b>          I didn't expect for you yourself to come.
          One of the heads, in the flesh.

<b>          MR. X

<b>          PUJA
</b>          I'm flattered.
          She reaches over to an attachâ‚¬ case and removes a file.

<b>          PUJA (CONT'D)
</b>          The name of the target is Henry Helms.
          Carrying the file, she moves around the desk and stands a
          few feet away from Mr. X, who rises so that they are both
          standing. She really is quite beautiful, exotic even,.
          with piercing eyes.

<b>          PUJA (CONT'D)
</b>          He's a journalist who stumbled on to a
          story exposing a lot of powerful people,
          people who don't like having their power
          threatened.
          MR. x
          Poor Helms.

<b>          PUJA
</b>          There.have been five attempts on his
          life, but he has been well protected...
          and well hidden. Turns out his wife's
          family has a lot of money. He's in town
          to accept an award.

<b>          MR. X
</b>          We'll see to it that it never makes his
          mantle.

<b>          PUJA
</b>          And for that, my clients will pay
          handsomely.
          Mr. X is looking at Puja when a curious thing happens...
          .he notices that the red bindi on he r forehead tarts
          to move a little, like a second dot is trying to emerge
          from it, like an amoeba splitting.
          It's a sh hooter's laser!
          His eyes go wide as saucers.
          MR. x

<b>          GET DOWN1!1

          splattering everything above her eyebrows into the wet

</b>          Mr. X crouches, drops his hands behind his back, and a.
          PAIR OF GUNS -- as technologically advanced as anything
          we've ever seen -- spring into his hands.
          The bullets .stop flying and he sprints at the window from
          which they came, smashing t rough what remains of it,
          disappearing from the demolished room...
          .all this as Puja's dead body hits the floor, blood
          seeping out of that holy third eye.

<b>          EXT. OUTSIDE THE SKYSCRAPER - FORTY FLOORS UP - DAY
</b>
          Mr. X's momentum carries him from one building to the
          next, over an alleyway, the wet-concrete shining below.
          He lands on the...

<b>          ROOF OF THE NEXT BUILDING:
</b>          ...and rolls up quickly, guns ready.
          His eyes spot FOUR MARKSMEN running and ducking for cover
          on the neighboring rooftop..
          .and on a dead sprint across the roof...
          . he spots about a CENTIMETER OF FLESH sticking out from
          around an air-conditioning vent. He fiKes the his
          left band.
          The bullet flies through the air and rockets into the
          flesh... which happens to be one of the marksmen's ears.
          The guy YELPS IN PAIN and falls back from the vent,
          exposing himself. That's all Mr. X needs, and another
          shot rings out while he's still on a dead run. THWAP!
          The bullet finds its mark in the yelping man's forehead,
          silencing him, just as...
          .Mr. X ducks behind a stairwell door.
          He pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of
          this pistol: built into the barrel is thin c u r
          screen. It actually shows the heat signatures of the
          three remaining marksmen, one of which is directly in
          front of him, hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed.
          A second marksmen is just on the other side of the
          stairwell. The third is on the far side of the rooftop.
          Mr. X takes another look at the heat signature of the
          marksman hiding behind the shed and he FIRES his gun...

<b>          
</b>

</b>
<b>          /~,
</b>          ...then does an amazing thing: in the split second that
          the bullet travels forward, he jerks his gun to the
          side... actually steering the bullet around the wall and
          into the ksman's throat.
          Before the guy's blood hits the ground, the assassin is
          moving again: he dashes away from the stairwell then
          makes two incredible shots; one knocks a piece of
          aluminum off the top of the stairwell...
          ..which causes it to flip up in the air above the head
          of the hiding marksman...
          . the second shot strikes the aluminum again, ,,..,sending
          the bullet ricocheting down into the ton of the
          marksman's heads As he falls...
          THE CAMERA MOVES OVER TO WHERE... the FINAL MARKSMAN is
          breathing hard, like an engine with a chronic misfire, as
          he looks out at the dead bodies of his fallen comrades...
          all chopped down in a matter of seconds.
          He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to psyche himself up...

<b>          LAST MARKSMAN
</b>
<b>          (SOFTLY)
</b>          C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
          He looks out at the stairwell door... and all is quiet.
          Maybe Mr. X didn't know he was there, maybe he left,
          maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all.

<b>          LAST MARKSMEN
</b>
<b>          (SOFTLY)
</b>          Okay... okay...
          He finally decides...
          .and takes one step forward...
          THWAP1!1 A bullet disintegrates his knee.
          He falls, clutching the knee in agony, as Mr. X walks
          toward him slowly until he stands right over him like a
          hunter over his prey.
          Mr. X's shoe comes down on the final marksman's wrist,
          pinning it away from his dropped weapon.

<b>          MR. X
</b>

<b>          (NERVOUSLY)
</b>          We're... we're just the decoys, man. We

          The marksman points at a small VIDEO CAMERA sitting on
          the roof, relaying their every move...
          Mr. X's face falls as.those words register, and just
          then...
          RA ROCKETS over thetreets of the city, block
          after block in the blink of any eye...
          .until it reaches a rooftop, over a mile away.

<b>          ON THE NEW ROOFTOP:
</b>          A man named CROSS is in a crouch, holding a massive RIFLE
          pointed upward, at an angle...
          A small SCREEN on Cross' gun shows the scene from the
          roof, along with various elemental measurements: wind
          speed, pressure, temperature, distance, altitude...
          .. the information on __the reflects off of Cross'

          the gun and a slight pull of the trigger...

<b>          BOOM...
</b>          We follow the arcing bullet back over the rooftops in an
          instant. Somehow it keeps it's elevation and it's
          path...
          .to the resigned look on Mr. X's face: an outsmarted
          man, a dead man.
          The bullet hits him square in the chest, and he falls to
          his knees, then slumps over, dead.
          Flies start to gather as he lies there.
          First one, then two, then several as night TIME-DISSOLVES

          Mr. X.

          BACKGROUND OF THE SHOT, his fat boss JANICE caught in mid-
          stride coming toward him, looking like she's ready to
          bring the wrath of God.

          Wesley is still sitting there with his note pad, while
          the consultant continues to rattle on and on about God
          knows what.
          Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley can spot
          his company.'s hot intern, NICOLE, talking on the phone.
          He zeroes in on her, until...
          Wesley suddenly looks around the room and everyone ijL_
          staring at him.

<b>          WESLEY

<b>          (HESITANTLY)
</b>          Yes. Uh... Well the 602 deals with
           applications sent by prospective clients

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm sorry, Jesus... uh... what was the
          question?

<b>          CONSULTANT
</b>          I asked you about the effects of net
          investment income with regards to
          underwriting cycles.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Well, that's the thing.-

<b>          CONSULTANT
</b>          What's the thing?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          (trying to redeem himself)
          Cycles. Hard market, industry-wide
          cycles differ from our firm's cycles so I
          think it's amistake to apply...

<b>          JANICE
</b>          Good God a'mighty.

<b>          CONSULTANT
</b>          Son... everyone knows that net
          investment income is inversely related to
          both premium and loss reserves, making
          firm cycles inherently dependent on
          industry cycles!
          Everyone snickers.

<b>          CONSULTANT (CONT'D)
</b>          In fact, to prove my point, I'd like you
          to spend some time this afternoon adding
          up the yearly differential responses.

<b>          JANICE
</b>          Get it to me by five.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Sure.
          Wesley jots down on his pad: "ACTION ITEMS," and
          underneath it: "Differential responses... then you die."
          He underlines it three times.

<b>          INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY

          Wesley sits at a small round table by himself, eating a
          ham and cheese on white.

</b>          A group of. other WORKERS sit at a table nearby, gossiping
          and guffawing about whatever shit they have to discuss.

<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          There are people, everyday you meet them,
          who you wish could see you in a different
          setting, a different place...
          Just then, Nicole, the pretty intern, approaches and
          starts fishing through the refrigerator.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          .instead of where you are, what you've
          become.
          Wesley sits upright, glad now that no one is sitting at
          his table. Nicole turns and smiles at Wesley, starts to
          head his way, when...

<b>          LOUDMOUTH AT OTHER TABLE
</b>          Nicole! Get your ass over here and.tell
          us what the hell is going on with you and
          Whitcock the big cock!
          He pulls a chair over from next to Wesley to make room
          for her at his table.
          Wesley just takes another bite of his sandwich.

<b>          INT. WESLEY'S CUBICLE - DAY
</b>
          Wesley is staring, at his monitor...

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          And you wish to god your eyeballs weren't
          being sucked out of their sockets by

          five years in college to do goddamn
          differential responses.
          see that he is actually i>laying solitaire on the
          computer. He keeps checking over his shoulder for
          Janice, but she is talking on the phone in her office
          with the door shut.
          He looks up and watches the computer clock turn from 4:59
          to 5:00. He saves his solitaire game and then turns off
          the computer, snatches up his jacket, waits for Janice to
          turn her back to him as she is engrossed in her call, and
          then sneaks away.

<b>          INT. ELEVATOR BANK - DAY

          Wesley presses the down button and waits.

          After an eternity, the doors open.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          But at least at the end. of the day...
          Wesley steps in and turns around. Before the doors
          close, he sees his boss Janice down the hall, looking at
          him. She checks her watch and looks back at him,
          pissed...

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>          (DEFEATED)
</b>          .you know that tomorrow it's going to

<b>          EXT.. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
          Wesley pedals a ten-speed down a busy street. It's
          raining, and he squints to keep the water out of his
          eyes.

<b>          EXT. ATM MACHINE - DAY
</b>
          He stands nervously at an ATM machine. He checks to see
          if anyone is looking, and then hits the "check balance"
          button.
          A message comes up: "You have $47.92 in your account.
          Would you like another transaction?"
          He clicks "yes" and then "quick cash" and waits for the
          $40 to dispense.

<b>          IN . WESLEY'S APARTMENT - DUSK
</b>          Wesley enters, toting his bike, only to find Cathy and
          Barry laughing on the couch, watching some crap on
          television.
          He's two steps in the door when...

          The ten-year-old Wesley moves furtively to a side of the
          clap trap house, and pries loose a board.

<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          ..so I had to hide my stash like it was
          a bag of many jane.
          Stuck in a hole is a copy of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO.
          He moves back around the corner and standing there is his

          .that same expression is plastered on Wesley's face as
          he pedals. He banks the bike up a curb and into a
          grocery store parking lot.
          Across the street, a man watches from behind the wheel of
          a 171 Chevy Chevelle.
          In fact, it's Cross, the man we last saw assassinating
          Mr. X on the rooftop.
          He watches Wesley park the bike and move into the store.

<b>          INT. KROGER - PASTA AISLE - NIGHT

          Wesley stands, looking over all the different kinds of
          noodles. None of them just say "spaghetti."

</b>          There is a remedy for all things but
          death.
          She said it so fast he's not sure he heard it right.
          He turns and sees the-hottest zQZM ever to ace
          Kroger's aisles: ox. She's wearing barely enough
          clothing to cover her tight body.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          (like he.didn't hear)
          I'm sorry?

<b>          FOX

          With that, she walks toward the end of the aisle, eyes
          scanning the whole time.
          Stunned, all Wesley can do is watch her walk.
          on the sMll f her back is a tatt It'
          tattoo we saw in the be i n n : a thKee-head2d dog.
          She gets to the end and catches him looking at her.
          Then she makes a very subtle gesture with her head... as
          if to say "come here."
          Wesley still isn't sure what the hell is going on.
          Sheepishly, he makes his way to where she stands.
          She leans in close, her lips just inches from his ear.

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)

          Wesley's eyes go wide as Fox suddenly starts firing, BAM!

          far side of the aisle.

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)

          She screams this, grabbing Wesley's wrist and jerking him
          forward, just as Cross comes back up, firing, a killing
          machine.
          They barely get out of the way, as the pasta aisle
          explodes in an avalanche of bullets! Glass bottles of
          spaghetti sauce shatter, turning the aisle into a
          rainstorm of red droplets -- we're not sure what is sauce
          and what is blood.
          Then... Cross springs on to a display stand of tortillas
          and up to the top of the freezer section, so he can have
          a better angle of attack at the fleeing Fox and Wesley.
          He starts sprinting down the top of the freezer section,
          smashing over styrofoam coolers, as his bullets barely
          miss Fox and Wesley, but slam into the freezers behind
          them, sending ice and glass exploding everywhere.

          But Fox just leaps into the passenger seat, guns up and
          ready, as Wesley's legs. somehow take over and he hops
          behind the wheel.
          Just then, Cross's ev ll Mound the corner,
          practically going up on two tires.
          Wham! Wesley turns the ignition, pope the clutch, and
          smashes the gas pedal as the car nearly snaps his neck
          when it launches forward.
          He races through the gears and rips around a corner and

          Fox does her best to send bullets back his way, while
          Wesley mans the wheel, breathing hard, still stunned at

          Fox looks at Wesley, momentarily stunned by his idea,

          hard right, where it bounces off a Fed Extrugk.,,, hat
          sends it into a violent roll.
          Wesley guns the Ferrari at the tumbling truck as it flips

          Wesley snaps back to reality and rips the Ferrari off the
          one-way street and down a side street.

          In the blink of an eye, Sloan has plucked the second gun
          off the rolling table and ',s

          WHAMQ! keeps hitting him over-and over again until
          Wesley's eyes roll to the back of his head.

<b>          INT. WESLEY'S A13ARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
          Wesley jerks awake in his bed...

<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          ...and the dream is still. on the fringe
          of your brain but you can't quite

          He looks up at his ceiling fan, barely turning, a few
          blades missing...

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          He sits up on his bed and checks himself in the mirror.
          His face has been pummeled; it looks like a piece of
          squashed fruit.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          This was nothing like that.

<b>          EXT. ATM MACHINE - DAY
</b>
          Wesley shoves his ATM card in the machine and hits the
          "check balance" button. Which reveals: $100,000.92.
          Amazed, Wesley takes out a grand, the machine just
          spitting him money.
          Smiling, Wesley jumps back on his ten speed and zips into
          traffic.
          The s in in wheel of the bicycle turns into...

          .that little spinning wheel on a monitor tbAt indicates

<b>          NICOLE
</b>          What happened to your face?
          Wesley turns in his chair, surprised. Nicole stands
          there, looking as pretty as ever, way out of -his league.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>
<b>          (SHEEPISH)
</b>          I... uh...I got hit by a man much bigger

          Nicole smiles, flirtatiously.

<b>          NICOLE
</b>          Was this over a girl?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Something like that.

<b>          NICOLE
</b>          I had no idea you had such a secret life

</b>          No. Not really. Same old Wesley.

<b>          NICOLE
</b>          I don't think so.
          She puts her hand on top of his; he can only stare at
          it... this kind of thing just doesn't happen to him.

<b>          NICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>          You aren't like these people Wesley.

          Wesley's about to say something, when he spots Janice

          With that, she steps away, just as Janice walks up.
          Wesley stands to face his boss, as Janice launches into
          him...

          Wesley just focuses on that mouth. Fat lips over fat
          gums over yellow teeth. But now all that's coming out of
          it is JIBBERISH.
          ' I Jibberish that goes straight from her larynx to Wesley's

          Heads all over the office start to poke out of the tops
          of their cubicles like gophers coming out of holes.
          Nicole watches, pleasantly stunned, from a few feet away.
          Janice looks around, shocked. Wesley likes the way that
          felt, so...

          With that, he throws all the papers off his desk, sending

          Empowered, Wesley marches toward the elevators as

          faces.
          The loudmouth from the break-room steps out...

          He holds up his hand for a high-five, but Wesley just

          his way to the elevators.

<b>          EXT. OUTSIDE WESLEY'S OFFICE - DAY

          Wesley flies out the front door, just as Fox's Diablo

          Fox grins as Wesley jumps in the car and she mashes on
          the pedal. The Diablo's tires smoke as she launches it
          out of there.

<b>          INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE ROOM - DAY

          They return to the butcher shop. Sides of beef hang from
          hooks next to a cutting table. The Butcher is sharpening
          a knife.

<b>          FOX
</b>          You need to get used to the blood and the

          The Butcher turns and slices a chunk of tenderloin off of
          one of the hanging carcasses, then slaps it on the table.

<b>          INT. TARGET ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
          Fox and Sloan stand next to a paper target -- the kind of
          thing you see in a police target range. It shows the
          outline of a head and torso with concentric rings for
          where you're supposed to aim.
          The Gunsmith hoists the corpse of the dead soccer mom on
          to a hook that hangs ten feet in front of the paper
          target. Sloan flips a switch and a motor takes the mom
          and target to the end of the range.
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Wesley is with them
          standing in one of those firearm booths at the opposite
          end of the range.

<b>          SLOAN

          and inspects it.

<b>          SLOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Excellent. This is an Imanishi 18. It

          something from this man. He reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out the bullet with the hole in its center...

          back through its center, filling the

          Sloan looks at him, like he might have been
          underestimating him until now.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Fox was telling me that my father used

          .a large room, the size of an auditorium. On the floor
          is a gigantic model of the entire city, built to scale,
          showing all the buildings, skyscrapers, churches, the
          waterfront, the city streets. Everything the city has to
          offer laid out in miniature.
          Sloan and Wesley stand like giants in the middle of the

</b>          Where we plot our local hits. This city

</b>          (looking around)
          This room. The books. Seems low-tech.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Part of mastering technology is knowing

          Your father built this room himself.
          Most of the buildings are white, but interspersed amongst
          them are a few vainted red. Some of the model street
          lamps are also red.

          some of the manhole covers.

<b>          WESLEY

          Sloan and Wesley walk down the sidewalk, passing
          streetlight after streetlight until they reach one in
          particular.

          Wesley peers at it... there is a plaque affixed to the
          pole... the standard thing you find on these things...
          "Municipal C. W. 63070."
          But then there is something different on this one... a
          tiny symbol on the bottom of the plaque... the Cerberus
          instead of the seal of the cit
          Sloan presses the symbol and the plaque slides aside,
          revealing a hollow space behind it. He reaches his hand
          inside and pulls out a small handgun... flips out the
          clip expertly, then racks the weapon.
          Wesley can't believe it.

          Wesley gets ready to squeeze his trigger, but a pistol
          starts FIRING next to him.
          He looks over... Sloan is standing nr= &o him, firing at

          Your father was meeting with a fence
          about the job when Cross took him down.
          So we can only assume Cross knows about
          the target too. We... you... have to
          take Cross out before we prosecute this
          mission. We can't have him out there as

          Sloan fires at the target, the bullets following his
          every command. Wesley does the same, equally skilled.
          Fox sits, watching the two of them. Is it becoming
          competitive? One shoots and then the other follows,
          neither one ever missing.
          Finally, Gunsmith runs the target back in to change out
          the body.
          Fox leans back, impressed.

<b>          FOX

          Sloan smirks and turns to instruct Wesley.

</b>          Wesley, at some point --

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          You wanna go first?

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          There are limits to everything, Wesley.

          Wesley pulls his gun and lets loose five rounds,

          The Gunsmith does and we see that each of the five
          bullets has passed clean through the cadaver and found
          it's mark on the target.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          You'll find one entry below the shoulder,
          missing the major blood vessels there,
          exiting the back. Second shot went
          through the abdomen, clipped only the
          bowel and exited cleanly. Third hit the
          upper right quadrant of the abdomen,
          which is partially protected by the
          ribcage, and passed through the liver and
          probably part of the gallbladder. Upper
          left abdomen is a good place, where
          number four ruptured the spleen before
          continuing down main street. And
          finally, what I like to call "the ,7FK."
          Number five entered the mouth, was
          redirected downward by the upper jawbone
          ON, and exited the back of the neck. That's
          the shot you'll find in the middle of the
          target.
          Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle of the target.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)

          He weaves in and out of traffic, then rips around a
          corner, narrowly cutting in front of an eighteen-wheeler,
          which has to slam on its brakes.

          Wesley whips the car around a corner...

          He pulls the car to the side of the street...
          .in front of a busy outdoor mall. It's covered with
          shops, eateries, movie theaters and people, people,
          people.
          Fox eyes the crowd.

          over in his hand.

          hands tucked into the front pocket of his hooded-
          sweatshirt, the pistol inside. People pass him on his
          left and right, some make eye contact, some don't...
          anybody could be the target..
          Wesley's eyes scan to the rooftops, surveying... the
          SECURITY GUARD by the theater, the SWEATER-FOLDER at The
          Gap, the SCARY-LOOKING GUY shopping at the sunglasses
          stand.
          And then Wesley's eyes settle on someone he was not
          expecting to see... Barry, his best friend that was
          shagging his girlfriend... is thumbing through books
          outside the BARNES AND NOBLE... seemingly. not paying
          attention to what's around him.
          Wesley can't believe it. It can't be him. Can it?
          Just then, Barry stops looking at the books and starts
          walking toward Wesley, keeping his eyes down. Fuck, this
          can't really be happening...

          .and he's looking at a man we recognize from his
          office... The Consultant.
          He's approaching rapidly behind Barry, fisting a 'pair of
          pistols!
          Just as Barry hits the deck, Wesley pulls the trigger...
          .but it lust CLICKS, the chamber empty...

</b>
<b>          THE OUTDOOR MALL:
</b>          Wesley can't believe his gun is empty. In the split-

          he darts behind a kiosk hocking monogrammed apparel, and
          dashes full speed through the crowds lining the street.
          The Consultant chases after him, knocking shoppers out of
          the way, sending fanny packs and Nordstrom bags flying.
          Wesley hooks a right around a SHARPER IMAGE and heads
          straight down a narrower section, like he's on a mission,
          knowing exactly where he's going. And now we see why...
          Because the city around us goes stark white like the Mg
          Room. We're seeing what Wesley sees, what he's memorized
          in all those hours staring at the model. Finally we see
          one SMALL BENCH next to a fountain, which is bright red.
          Immediately the natural color of the city c2 Ws back and
          Wesley is running all out for that bench. He goes into a
          slide, hitting the grass .underneath the bench, sliding
          under it, popping up on the other side.
          He rips a metal panel off the back of it as he does,
          revealing an AUTOMATIC PISTOL...
          .and just as quickly, he's up on one knee, aiming,
          using the bench as a shield as the Consultant rushes up,
          surprised and BAM! BAM! BAM:
          The Consultant drops where he is, three bullets hitting
          him in his two shoulders and his chest.
          People start SCREAMING and RUNNING the hell away from the
          gunplay. Wesley is about to run away himself, but when
          he turns, Fox is right there beside him... smiling. A
          couple of SECURITY GUARDS are with her, smiling as well.
          Wesley looks over at The Consultant, who site up, smiling
          too, even though he's bleeding from three spots on his
          body...

          Wesley looks down at the gun.

          Fox nods, as the Security Guards go to help the
          Consultant to his feet.

          with his little legs dangling over the end of his chair.

          hears a loud THUMP.

          He gets no answer. He remains perfectly still,
          listening.

          Two louder THUMPS and a GUNSHOT jerk his head around.
          Then he's up out of the chair, faster than we thought a
          little man could move.
          Breathing ragged, shimmying across his work space, Pek
          War hurries over to a chest of drawers.
          He gets to it and throws open the bottom drawer to reveal
          a stash of handguns. He reaches for one...

          Wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          On the pallet.
          They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the
          lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs
          into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching
          on the pallet on the front.

          The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of
          newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await.

<b>          WITH THE ELECTRICIAN:
</b>          The Electrician hustles between the pallets and boxes,
          eyes darting, guns drawn. He backs up to a pallet of
          stacked newspapers, using it as cover. What he doesn't
          realize is that between each stack of papers is a space,
          just big enough for a --
          THWAP! A bullet finds its way through the space and hits
          the Electrician in the back of the shoulder, spinning him
          around.
          CLOSE ON: Cross' gun. Another shot and we follow the
          bullet, across the dock and dipping low into the next
          space in the paper stack -- right where Electrician is
          now leaning...
          .the bullet buries in his eye, sending him to the
          flog.
          Wesley sees Cross race for a set of stairs. Just as
          Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden
          beam holding back some massive rolls of NEWSPAPER. The
          rolls tumble over and Wesley has to dive out of the way,
          allowing Cross to escape up the stairs.
          Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs.

<b>          ON LEVEL TWO:
</b>          Giant printing machines are running full speed, printing
          up the morning edition.
          A group of NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES see the guns the
          Fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety.
          Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring
          machines...

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          (to the Waiter)
          Stay here and cover us. There's no angle
          for him to hit you if you stay here.
          Wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the
          machines.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't let him get up there. And stay
          clear of the presses! He'll use them
          however he can.

<b>          WAITER
</b>          How do you know?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          It's what I'd do.
          With that, Wesley and Fox disappear amongst the
          machinery.
          The Waiter takes a step back from the press, where over a
          hundred pounds of paper spins through every second.
          He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that
          scaffolding. Everything looks clear, until...
          ...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o
          Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans
          of spray lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal,
          until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it
          to explode!
          The burning oil covers the Waiter, who SCREAMS and
          stumbles nearer the printing press...

<b>          BAM BAM BAM!
</b>          More shots from Cross and one of the RESTRAINING ARMS on
          the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in half.
          The paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a.
          saw, cuts the Waiter in hplf !
          With a leap, Cross is on the scaffolding over the
          presses. For just a second, Cross stops as he locks eyes
          with Wesley...
          ..but Fox is already firing at him so Cross has to keep
          moving...
          He heads up a second staircase, but not before he sends a
          stream of bullets back at Fox, who athletically
          cartwheels away...
          .but one of Cross's bullets disintegrates a gear on the
          press near her, sending flying metal everywhere. A piece
          of shXapnel b ies into Fox's leg... making her break out
          of her cartwheel and flop down, wounded.

          Cross races along the scaffolding and disappears into a
          door.

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)
</b>          Keep goin', baby! Take him!
          Wesley races for the stairs. He is the only one left to
          chase Cross to level three.

<b>          ON LEVEL THREE:
</b>          Wesley bursts through the door, guns ready. The place is
          already in pandemonium, with PEOPLE yelling and screaming
          and running for cover. Quickly, Wesley realizes he's in
          the business offices of the paper, and it looks
          surprisingly similar to his old office. Lame-ass
          cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere.
          Wesley jumps up on a desk.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Cross!
          Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of
          the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at
          Cross... who immediately returns fire...
          .and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets
          in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a
          COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE.
          The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving
          over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the
          Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each
          other from sharp angles...
          Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck,
          but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the
          same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man
          using the same techniques at the exact same time.
          Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the
          words "Action Items" written on it. He fires at it, and
          his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them
          strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!!
          Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to
          flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely
          avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby
          window, smashing the glass out,

</b>          Wesley doesn't hesitate behind him... he sprints for the
          same window and dives through it, guns at the ready
          and...

<b>          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW:
</b>          .we stay with Wesley as he falls from the third floor,
          firing his guns the whole time...
          .until he lands top of an "L" train moving at ll
          speed.

<b>          THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT:
</b>          Fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to
          the Porsche. She ignores her wounds and rips the car out
          of the alley, chasing after the fleeing L train.

<b>          ON THE L TRAIN:
</b>          Ahead of Wesley, Cross is also on the top of the train.
          He manages to get up, spin around, and fire at Wesley...
          .but they both have to duck as the L train whips under
          an overpass, which misses smashing both of them by mere
          inches.
          Cross takes the opportunity to swing down between cars
          and enter one of the L cars.

<b>          BEHIND HIM:
</b>          Wesley hurries across the top of the train, spying the
          trail of blood that Cross is leaving behind from his
          wound.
          Wesley smiles, a shark on a wounded baby seal, as he also
          swings down between the cars and enters...

<b>          THE FIRST L CAR:
</b>          .where he sees the trail of blood leading all the way
          down the center of the empty car and out the back door.
          Wesley hovers in the entry way, his guns up and ready.
          He takes a step forward to follow the blood trail, and
          immediately, he is decked from the side by an ambushing
          Cross.
          They tumble over the first row of seats, both losing
          their guns.

</b>          Wesley kicks Cross off of him, but Cross-spins with two
          new suns in his hand! Wesley is.on him quick though, and
          SLAMS Cross into one of the train's windows hard enough
          to crack it. With a quick twist of Cross' wrist, Wesley
          takes a sun from him Just as Cross kicks h,m off...
          .Wesley fires as he falls backwards. Cross falls
          backwards too from the momentum...
          ..and they both smash out opposite windows of the train
          before landing on either side of it!

<b>          EXT. DIRTY ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
          But the amazing thing is... they stand up and keep
          firing as the cars are whipping by at 80mph, and
          realize they. are timing their shots to actually blast
          between each car in the s it-second the opening passes.

<b>          ON THE TRAIN:
</b>          COMMUTERS ride along in blissful ignorance, reading their
          papers, holding on to the handrails... completely unaware
          of the gunfight raging outside the train.
          A bullet whizzes through an open window, pierces a
          BUSINESSMAN'S paper, and exits a window on the opposite
          side of the car. The man sticks his finger through the
          hole, unaware of the battle outside. What the hell?

<b>          IN THE ALLEY:
</b>          On opposite sides of the train, Wesley and Cross are both
          sprinting and firing, trying to get to the end of the
          last train, while dodging each other's bullets...
          .as the last car passes, they each jump on the tracks,
          ending u with guns tucked under each other's chin!

<b>          CROSS
</b>          Wesley!
          This takes Wesley aback...

<b>          CROSS (CONT'D)
</b>          Look into my eyes!
          Wesley's finger is starting to squeeze his trigger... as
          is Cross's.

<b>          CROSS (CONT'D)
</b>          (growls, in pain)
          Look into my eyes, goddammit!

</b>          Finally, Wesley does and his face goes slack as he sees
          himself reflected in Cross's Dupils.
          Just then, Fox pulls up in the Porsche about fifty yards
          away, and her headlights illuminate them.
          Cross shifts his eyes to her, then does a curious thing:
          he lowers his gun, then drops it to the ground. Wesley
          can't believe Cross would leave himself defenseless.
          Moving swiftly, Cross men tucks something into the
          Rocket of Wesley's hooded sweatshirt.

<b>          CROSS (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>          (WHISPERS)
</b>          Everything they told you was a lie,
          Wesley.
          With that... Cross falls down. His black jacket spills
          open to show a gun shot wound not just to his shoulder,
          but to hig n too. one of Wesley's bullets through
          the train must have found its mark.
          Cross is bleeding profusely. He gasps a couple of
          times... then, with his last bit of energy...

<b>          CROSS (CONT'D)
</b>          Find the missing piece. And... don't...
          let them... dispose of the weapon...
          With that, the life goes out of Cross's eyes.
          Wesley stares at that face, trying to decipher some
          meaning there. But Cross just stares blankly back at
          him, just as Fox comes limping up.

<b>          FOX
</b>          You did it, baby! Son of a bitch, you
          did it. You put down motherfucking
          Cross!
          Wesley looks down and sees some of Cross's blood on his
          hands from their clench. There is also some on the gun
          he is holding. ar --h d ed crun.
          Wesley reaches down and takes the other pearl-handled gun
          from where it dropped and looks over them both.

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)
</b>          What'd he say to you?
          Wesley looks up, sees some sort of anticipation in Fox's
          eyes. He looks back down at Cross's body..

          Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the
          whole story. Finally, she nods...

<b>          FOX
</b>          Well... damn, I couldn't be more proud of

<b>          FOX
</b>          You sure?
          But he's already walking off. She watches him go,
          thinking...

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
</b>
          Wesley walks down the street. PEOPLE instinctively get
          out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk.
          Then he pulls out what Cross slipped inside his pocket:
          a beaten-up copy of COUNT OF ONTE CRISTO. In fact,
          there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid.
          Wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the
          cover... printed on the inside in a steady hand are the
          words: "I left you something."
          Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a
          Harley at a curb. He bee-lines for the guy.

<b>

<b>          EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING

          Wesley now blazes down the highway, pushing the Harley to
          its limits. His angry expression hasn't dissipated.

<b>          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
</b>
          The Harley pulls up to a lower-middle-class house, the
          kind you might find in any run-down suburb. Kids run
          around the neighborhood, playing.

<b>          ON THE BIKE:
</b>          Wesley sits and looks at one particular house. He climbs
          off'and heads to the side of the house, still carrying
          his book.

<b>          SIDE OF THE HOUSE:
</b>          He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down
          the side of the house...
          .until he finds a familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar
          because we've seen this place before: it's where he
          lived when he was a foster kid.
          He removes the board, then reaches into the hole. His
          hand seizes on something. From the hole, he withdraws a
          KEY attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North
          Highbury St.
          Wesley's eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the
          key, and back to the book.
          Finally, he lowers his hands... revealing a little eight-
          year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back yard.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Hey.

          He tosses the kid the book and heads off.

<b>          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
</b>
          He pulls the Harley over to a curb and then reaches into
          his jacket pocket and withdraws the note and the key.
          Across the street, the address matches: 1850 N.
          Highbury. The place looks like a concrete fortress... no
          windows, just a large-iron door in front.
          Wesley approaches, not sure what the address could mean.
          He gets to the door, looking for a key-hole, but he
          doesn't find one.
          He fidgets there awkwardly for a second, but then...
          .the door opens, revealing a woman, ANNA. She takes a
          look at Wesley and then puts a trembling hand over her
          lips.

<b>          ANNA
</b>          Come in, Wesley.
          He stares at her, trying to figure this out. He steps...

<b>          INSIDE THE HOUSE:
</b>          .and finds that the place is nicely decorated; an
          attempt to cover up what is really a reinforced bunker.

<b>          ANNA
</b>          He's dead, isn't he?
          There's no point lying to this woman...

          Wesley looks up and sees what she's referring to. The
          walls are filled with pictures of Andrew, Anna, and...
          remarkably...
          ...photoaraths of Wesley at various ages w hgn he was-
          growing u !

<b>          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          This was his favorite.
          She hands him a picture of Wesley at about age 12,
          sitting with his back to a tree, reading COUNT OF MONTE
          CRISTO. The picture has been taken through a windshield,
          across the street.
          Wesley reels, his legs give out, he slumps against one of
          the walls...
          FLASH: Cross firing at Fox and Wesley at the grocery
          store. But now we see that Fox positioned Wesley between
          herself and the shooter. He wasn't trying to hit Wesley,
          he was trying to separate him from her.

          that there isn't jealousy in those eyes.
          Wesley still slumped against the wall, surrounded by
          pictures of himself...
          FLASH: Wesley reflected in Cross's pupils.
          Holy shitl!! Cross was his father!!! Wesley looks up at
          Anna's kind face...

<b>          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          When your father and I found each other,
          when we had Andrew, he said he could no
          longer live the way he had been living.
          He said he wouldn't give us up, the way
          he had given up his first eon.
          Wesley stares at the picture... he can't believe he was
          being watched back when he felt so alone.

<b>          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>          It was his greatest regret.
          She leaves him in the room, alone, with his brother.
          Wesley watches the kid, trying to process it all.
          For the first time, emotions overcome him, and he breaks
          down...
          .but he's too tough now to sob, so he forces the Bob
          down in his throat and blinks back the tears. Goddamn,
          he has a brother.

<b>          IN THE KITCHEN OF THE SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

</b>          would you like some coffee?

<b>          WESLEY

          before you ever pulled the trigger. He

          where you can eat and not be bothered.
          The doors swing open and Fox looks up. The silhouette of

          person in a long black coat...

          Wesley steps into the light and moves over to the table

<b>          FOX
</b>          Goddammit, Wesley...
          She stabs out her cigarette, crushing it on the hot grill
          so that it SIZZLES.

<b>          FOX (CONT'D)

          With that, she kicks back from the table, holding a huge

</b>          Wesley only has a millisecond to respond,-and he does by
          kicking over the table, which sends food and utensils
          flying, but also shields him from Fox's bullets.
          Just as quickly, Fox leaps up on top of one of the other
          tables, trying to keep her heels on the sides so that her
          feet don't touch the hot grill. If she's wounded, we
          wouldn't know it.
          Wesley does the same on a nearby table. They take shots
          at each other as they leap from table to table, avoiding
          the sizzling centers, but they're both so quick that no
          bullets find their mark.
          Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously
          fast. She's like the animal she's named after, and she
          launches off one of the tables...
          .and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a
          form tackle on to a table...
          ..where he lands Quare on the oven top... PSSSSBHH...
          and his guns go flying across the room as...
          .the table to starts to burn through his clothes!

</b>          You shoulda known better, baby...
          But he rolls over, taking Fox with him, and now the oven-
          is burning into her back.
          With all her strength, she bucks him off and then flips
          herself backwards off the table. With another kick, she
          sends the hot table flying at him. It rips free from its
          wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas out into the
          restaurant... SSSSSSSSS...
          Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not
          before it burns his arm as he blocks it.
          Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a
          hailstorm of bullets.
          But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor
          Pete Rose style, sliding to a stop at the precise moment
          where his hands come u holSling his weapons.

          sweltering fire keeps pouring out!
          Fox dives to get out of the way, which gives Wesley the
          opening he was looking for. He FIRES again, and one of
          his bullets knocks her crun away and another nicks her in
          the side of the face.
          She stops, seeing the blood drip down her cheek and off
          her chin. This only seems to enrage her.
          Pissed, she produces two S R GUNS out of the small of
          her bac -- where she had them hidden we have no idea --
          and charges Wesley like an unleashed Pit Bull...

          this time, knocking Wesley's guns out of his hands from
          where he lies flat on the floor.
          She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless...
          .and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face
          bleeding, both gun barrels pointed right at Wesley's
          face...

          But, Wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she
          reels...
          In the same motion, he grabs her wrists and pulls her
          toward him... taking her guns right out of her hands like
          a quick-change artist.
          Flipping them over, Fox's face full of surprise is the
          last expression she'll ever have because...

          of the last several hours washing over him.

          The boy hands him the building in his hand. It is

          Sure enough, the entire floor of the basement has been
          made into a model map, similar to the one that the
          Fraternity used in the map room, but all the buildings
          are black, with an occasional red mark.
          The scale is larger, the model shows only one section of

          streets.
          And on the wall are PICTURES and CLIPPINGS of Henry
          Helms.
          Wesley squats over it, trying to figure out what his
          father's plan was. He sees a missing place for a
          building and puts Andrew's toy back in place, then
          studies the map some more.

          with his note pad, the words "LIFE SUCKS AND THEN YOU
          DIE" printed over and over, while the consultant
          continues to rattle on and on.
          Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley spots the

          SIRENS wail and a HELICOPTER hovers nearby as Wesley
          stands on a roof, looking down on the scene. He sees
          EMT's roll a gurney out toward an ambulance as COPS cover
          every inch of the ground.
          From where he is, it looks like every cop in the city is

          He passes a newspaper dispenser, but the CAMERA STAYS.on

          death threat has dragged him down.
          A door opens, and we see his wife, SARAH HELMS, step past
          two, huge BODYGUARDS to come in.

</b>
          A gaggle of large bodyguards surround the Helmses as they
          hurry out of a side door and make it into a LIMOUSINE.
          They notice the half dozen MOTORCYCLE COPS positioned
          around their limo.
          A LEAD BODYGUARD holds the limo door for them.

          He shuts the door for them before climbing behind the

          The limo starts to make its way down the drive, flanked
          in front and in back by dark SUBURBANS and the motorcycle
          cops.

          blood.

<b>          ON A CITY STREET:

<b>          IN THE LIMO:
</b>          The bodyguards peer up at the buildings ready for
          anything.
          Henry Helms reaches over and grabs his wife's hand, a
          reassuring gesture. But his white knuckles betray his
          trepidation.
          The driver watches as they reach a frontage road on the
          east side of the river.

<b>          ON THE ROAD:
</b>          They make a turn along the river and haul ass toward the
          bridge. Traffic is sparse and they look like they have
          an easy clear passing.

<b>          ON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP:

<b>          QUICK SHOTS:
</b>          On the hospital roof, the Gunsmith puts down his
          binoculars and picks up a rifle.
          The Pharmacist leans over the edge of a building and
          looks down, high-powered rifle in his hand.
          On another building, the Chef does the same.
          And on still another building, the Gardener also gets
          ready.
          Each killer is in a different spot and has a gun, pointed
          and ready, just waiting for the signal...

<b>          ON THE ROAD:
</b>          The limo is about halfway up the incline now, a sitting
          duck, hellfire about to rain down upon it.

<b>          ON THE HOSPITAL ROOFTOP:
</b>          The Gunsmith waits, waits, waits...
          .and then, out of nowhere, surprising the hell out of
          him, a knife is held to his neck from behind.
          The Gunsmith doesn't even so much as swallow, as the
          blade is so tight against his throat that it draws a drop
          of blood.

          The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley's voice.

<b>          GUNSMITH
</b>          You don't understand, man. This ain't

          THE CAMERA WHIPS around behind Wesley... to show that
          three laser sights are lighting up his back in a perfect
          pattern.
          And now we see it, this was al a Bet-up to get Wesley in
          the open. The three surrounding rooftops, slightly more
          elevated, hold each of the three assassins crouched-in
          sniper positions, zeroed in on Wesley's back.
          But instead of surprise, Wesley just leans in closer to
          the Gunsmith's ear.

<b>          WESLEY

          And with that, he rolls the o0 over of ,
          just as the assassins on the higher rooftops all unleash
          a hail of bullets.
          BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! The Gunsmith takes a dozen
          shots, all in the chest, but none of the bullets make it
          through the Gunsmith's body.

          body as a shield.

          Wesley bursts from the stairwell doorway and moves to the

          cartridges out of his guns and is about to reload when he

          showing that he is out of ammo.

          They charge each other, the blades whizzing and clanging

<b>          THE STREET:
</b>          .the two men slashing, ducking, and moving in the
          middle of the street. -
          Wesley strikes three auick swipes acrosiLthe Butcher's
          face And forehead, filling his eyes with blood.
          The Butcher grabs his face and sees the blood streaming
          on to his hands. He tries to wipe the blood from his
          eyes, but it's just getting worse.

<b>          THE BUTCHER
</b>          I can't see!

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          But you can hear. So hear this: To cut
          the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice-
          pick style...
          Wesley lunges and the Butcher is defenseless to stop it.

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          ...and thrust down behind the clavicle,
          cutting side to side.
          He does just as he describes and the big guy topples over
          as his gore spills out into the street.
          But before he can gloat, Wesley realizes his new
          predicament...
          He's standing in the middle of the street, and at one end
          is the chef, and at the other is the Gardener. To make
          things worse, directly across the street from Wesley is
          the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him.

<b>          THE PHARMACIST
</b>          Three on one, mate. You're out of ammo.
          And you're in a part of the map with no
          Fraternity stashes.

<b>          (LAUGHS)
</b>          That's what I'd call a real ball ache.
          For a moment, Wesley stands there, sizing up the
          situation. His eyes swivel from the Gardener to the Chef
          to the Pharmacist.
          Just then, the buildings ound all of them go black.,
          just like in cross's model! Wesley's eyes fall on the on
          the red corner of the nearest building, a cement block
          making up a decorative support column in front of it.

<b>

</b>          Wesley smiles.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          I'm working off of a different map.
          With that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and
          he races for the building, jumping up onto and over a
          Lexus parked at the curb. The three assassins fire
          relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car,
          smashing it to bits... as...
          . on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a slide just
          as he reaches that cement block... affixed to it is a
          small SILVER CROSSI Wesley slaps his hand on the Cross
          and the cement block mechanically opens, revealing: a new
          pair of sophisticated MA ISHIS I
          As his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the
          guns, spins, splits both hands apart and we...

<b>          SPLITSCREEN:
</b>          ...to follow both of his bullets in flight.

<b>          ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:
</b>          .THE BULLET from the left gun heads for the Chef. He
          tries to drop down, but the bullet curves downward, it
          pierces his body... and...

<b>          INSIDE HIS BODY:
</b>          We see the bullet ricochet off of one of his ribs-exit
          his side and head for the Pharmacist, while...

<b>          ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:
</b>          ...the bullet from the right gun heads for the Gardener,
          who moves fast to fire his own gun, but the bullet
          catches him in the wrist, knocking his gun out of his
          hand, and...

<b>          INSIDE THE WRIST:
</b>          . it hits the Gardener's scaphoid bone, ricocheting out,
          also, right at the Pharmacist...

<b>          THE SCREEN RETURNS TO NORMAL:
</b>          .just as the two bullets come together...

<b>          THE PHARMACIST
</b>          Bugger.

</b>          hitting the Pharmacist on both sides of-his head,
          before he can even react.
          Wesley watches a pink spray shoot out from both sides of
          the Pharmacist's head as he falls to the asphalt, dead.
          But Wesley's not through, he moves over to the Gardener
          and rolls him over.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Where is he?

<b>          THE GARDENER
</b>          Where it started..
          BAN! Wesley ends it for the Gardener.

<b>          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>
          We've seen this place before. It's the same roof where
          cross took out the second head of
          The door is kicked open and Wesley walks out, eyes
          blazing.
          Sloan is waiting for standing t feet away,
          holding his father's pearl-handled gun, trained right on
          Wesley's head.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Can't say I don't have a sense of irony.
          The place I first decided to bring you
          in.
          Wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded
          hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops.

<b>          SLOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          You once asked why I helped hide you as
          an infant... It gave me power, Wesley'.
          Power to become a head of the Fraternity.
          Power over your father. And ultimately
          it gave me you: the perfect weapon to
          kill your father.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          But now you have to dispose of the
          weapon.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          In some ways it pains me to do so. You
          460 are like the son I never had.

<b>

</b>
<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Fuck you.
          Sloan's eyes narrow.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>          Fine. Keep your worthless dignity.
          You're still just the same loser we
          plucked off the street six weeks ago.
          Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in. Sloan laughs
          derisively.

<b>          SLOAN (CONT'D)
</b>          You can't win, Wesley. The Fraternity is
          everywhere. Even if you kill me others
          will come from other cities to take my
          place. You'll be hunted your whole life.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          But that's not gonna happen. Like I told
          you before, when we are called, death is
          as certain as the sun.
          Wesley stands as straight as he can muster. The two men
          face each other like two gunmen on Main Street in Dodge
          city... an old newspaper even blows through like a
          tumbleweed.
          And we are close on Wesley's face. act it i the
          same shot from the opening of the movie.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and
          pathetic.
          We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his
          bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve...

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          But not today.
          With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun,
          the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they
          both open fire...
          .Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan
          does the same. Just like he did with h' father.
          .But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's
          mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took
          the knife.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>          WESLEY (CONT'D
</b>          Uhhh!
          He can't raise his arm, it's useless, but he's come too
          damn far to stop now... he flips his gun from his good
          hand to his bad hand and manages to keep FIRING!
          Then Wesley does something unexpected... he starts
          sprinting straight at Sloan, still knocking his bullets
          out of the air...
          He closes the gap... ten feet... five feet...
          ..a surprised and worried expression now spreads on
          Sloan's face,.like what is this kid doing?
          But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots the gun out of
          Sloan's hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his
          feet!
          They go flying right over the edge of the building.
          Wesley's able to grab on to a railing cable and stop
          himself...
          ..but Sloan is going to go over.
          At the last moment, Sloan reacher. for-something.
          anything. and grabs one-handed the barrel of
          Wesley's gun...
          For a moment, they dangle there in this precarious
          position, looking each other in the face. Sloan can't
          believe he's been bested by this kid.

<b>          SLOAN
</b>
<b>          (SNARLS)
</b>          Go ahead and shoot me, killer. Just like
          you did your old man.
          Wesley's finger starts to squeeze the trigger, but then
          he smiles...

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          I'm done with this life. Just like my
          father.
          And with that, Wes1gy drops the n out of his h

          .until it SMASHES into the sidewalk, splattering like a

<b>          ON THE ROOFTOP:
</b>          Wesley rolls over on to his back, looking up at the
          darkening sky.

<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          It's true. Six weeks ago I was ordinary
          and-pathetic. Just like you.
          He sits up, moving OUT OF FRAME.

<b>          CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
          The place is now blanketed with cops, looking at the dead
          bodies, trying to make sense of what happened.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          But I've learned something in that time.
          I've learned about the man who made me.

<b>          EXT. DOWNTOWN CORNER - DAY
</b>
          Cope stand on the street, handing out pictures of Wesley,
          asking pedestrians if they've seen this man.

<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          I've learned about the man I am.

<b>          INT. POST OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          Patrons stand in line at a post office, but the'CAMERA
          PUSHES PAST THEM, finding a black and white "WANTED"
          poster of Wesley, describing all the killings he's
          responsible for. It holds tight on the picture.

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          I've learned that all of us are unique,
          even though sometimes we're too fucking
          blind to see it.

<b>          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
</b>
          The door to the safehouse opens, and Anna, Wesley and
          Andrew step out into the bright sunlight. Wesley is
          carrying his little brother.

</b>          They turn and head up the street, toward the eastern sun.
          The CAMERA RISES UP, UP, UP, where it hovers for a
          minute... and just when we think it is going to leave the
          planet...

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And I learned, the easiest place to hide
          is in plain sight.

<b>          INT. TYPICAL INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          ..Wesley sitting at a computer in the middle of another
          cubicle maze, pecking away at his keyboard. A sign
          attached to one wall reads: "SAN ANGELO INSURANCE
          ASSOCIATES: Setting the Bar Highl"
          Office workers mill about in their drab suits and ties,
          wishing they were anywhere else.
          A pretty RECEPTIONIST comes over to Wesley's desk.

<b>          RECEPTIONIST
</b>          You're the new guy, huh?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Just started last week.

<b>          RECEPTIONIST
</b>          Where'd you move here from?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          All over the place, really. Nothing too
          exciting.

<b>          RECEPTIONIST
</b>          Well, welcome to the team. Just watch
          out for Brokaw. He'll stab you in the
          back first chance he gets.
          Just then, a harried man, BROKAW, comes storming up.

<b>          BROKAW
</b>          Jesus, Connie, don't you have some faxes
          to get to?
          The receptionist hurries away, making a face as she does.

<b>          BROKAW (CONT'D)
</b>          Laziest skirt I ever hired. But nice fun
          bags, I'll give her that.

<b>          BROKAW (CONT ' D )
</b>          Jim, right?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Yes, sir.

<b>          BROKAW
</b>          Listen, Jim, I don't want to get started
          off on the wrong foot here, but we.have
          numbers to make and if we don't make
          those numbers, it's my ass on the line.
          And if my ass gets chewed out by
          regional, I can guarantee.that your ass
          is gonna be Purina doggy chow. Now I'm
          not sure how they ran things...
          Wesley stares at that mouth zeroing in further and--
          further, until the words become gibberish, just like they
          did with Janice.
          Wesley catches himself and snaps out of it, just in time
          to hear...

<b>          BROKAW (CONT'D)
</b>          .so do we understand each other?

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Of course.

<b>          BROKAW
</b>          Good boy.
          With that, he hurries away, his pants riding so high up
          his ass that they look like they may burst at any second.
          Wesley stares up at the clock on his monitor: it reads
          11:15. He stands up, stretches, and makes his way to the
          receptionist's desk. She looks up, bites her lower
          lip...

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          You want to take a break with me?

<b>          RECEPTIONIST
</b>          Sure!
          She stands and they move toward the elevators, waiting
          for the doors to open.

<b>          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
</b>          You know, we don't usually get breaks.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Just then, the elevator doors DING.

<b>          WESLEY
</b>          Well, you'll find there's nothing "usual"
          about me.
          They climb in.
          THE CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on Wesley's
          face...

<b>          WESLEY (V.O.)
</b>          This life is ours, to make of it what we
          can.
          .until it fills the screen, looking just like the shot
          of Wesley we started with. And then a sly smile spreads
          across his mug...

<b>          WESLEY (V.0.)
</b>          I think I'll give it a shot.
          .and as the doors close, we officially...
