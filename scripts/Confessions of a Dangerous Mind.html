            This film is a reenactment of actual
            events. It is based on Mr. Barris's
            private journals, public records, and
            hundreds of hours of taped interviews.

<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT
</b>
<b>SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981
</b>
It's raining.    A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street.

<b>INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Looking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his
passenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a "P"
insignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the
back seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the
scrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street
light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few
of the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet);
.38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays).

<b>GONG SHOW
</b>
An excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image
fills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet,
punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The
audience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck
Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the
wings to comfort the agitated performer.

<b>                      PERFORMER
</b>            Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.

<b>                      BARRIS (AGE 50)
</b>            I don't understand. Juice, why'd you
            gong this nice man?

<b>                         JAYE P. MORGAN
</b>            Not to be.     That is the answer.

The studio audience laughs.

<b>INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT
</b>
The cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The
young man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the
fluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to
staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The
meter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags.

<b>GONG SHOW
</b>
Chuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene
Gene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points
at it.

<b>                      BARRIS
</b>            We'll be right back with more stuff.

<b>INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT
</b>
The back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes.
The cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a
shady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a
big wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands.
The meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change.

<b>THE GONG SHOW
</b>
Chuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog.
The audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image
explodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot
toward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a
darkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past
taped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like
"Gong Show a New Low in Television", "The Dumbing of
America", and "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western
Civilization." We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man
crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This
is Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark,
and smoke. There is a knock at the door.

<b>                      BARRIS
</b>                (mumbly)
            Fuck. Shit. Piss.


Naked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He
hesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer
the door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge?
Finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for
a long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty,
young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags.

He tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked
Chuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in
the background.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)

          More stuff?

<b>                    BELLHOP

          But thank you. Thank you for trying.

Barris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the
hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. The bellhop
places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls
out some bills.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Keep it. It's okay. Keep it.    You are a

Barris trails off.

<b>                    BELLHOP
</b>              (eyes averted)
          Thank you, sir.

Suddenly Barris becomes agitated.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          Why are you not looking at me like that?
          Do I look ugly to you?

          It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping,

Barris trails off. There is a pause.   The bellhop attempts
to make conversation.

<b>                    BELLHOP
</b>              (re: exploded tv)
          Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?

The naked Barris approaches the bellhop, drapes his arm over
the young man's shoulder and walks with him.

          You know what I'd do? -- And don't tell
          anybody -- I'd rub... I'd rub Alpo brand
          dog food on my dick so the dogs would
          stick their noses into my... dick.
          Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my
          trick, my great contribution to the
          world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I
          ask you.

There is a silence.

<b>                       BARRIS (CONT'D)

          I ask you!
<b>                    BELLHOP
</b>          I... I... I don't know, sir.

Suddenly Barris punches himself in the head, flops down on
the unmade bed. The bellhop glances at Barris's bare ass,
looks away.

<b>                    BELLHOP (CONT'D)
</b>          Mr. Barris, maybe if you just don't watch
          the show every night, you wouldn't have
          to --

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          I always pay for the damn tv's, don't I?
              (turning to face him)
          Don't I?!

</b>          It's -- Yes, you do, sir, and we
          appreciate that -- It's just that
          there've been complaints from some of the
          other guests, and Mr. Andrews, the
          assistant manager, requested that I --

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          Still? Complaints? I specifically used
          the silencer this time! Specifically!

<b>                    BELLHOP
</b>          Well, the people in 917 found a bullet
          lodged in their wall. And while we want
          to accommodate you -- we certainly value
          your patronage -- there is an issue of
          customer safety.

Barris lets this sink in.

</b>

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          Yes, of course.

Barris finds his pants draped over a chair, pulls out his
wallet, holds some more money out to the bellhop.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          My apologies. Buy -- 917, is it? -- buy
          them a magnum of your finest champagne.
          And... and your finest spackle. Oh, and
          get me a bag of plastic army men while
          you're out. I forgot to tell you before.

The bellhop sighs, takes the money.

<b>                    BELLHOP
</b>          Thank you for your understanding, sir.

The bellhop exists.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>              (calling after)
          And some black socks!   Seven black socks,
          you rascule!

Barris locks the door, dumps the contents of the bags onto
the floor, fishes through the mess for a cigar, puts the
cigar in his mouth, studies himself in a full length mirror.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by
          the sight of me. And why not? I'm
          wrinkled...
              (searches for simile, then
               proudly)
          ... like a prune. Covered in liver
          spots...
              (searches for simile)
          ... like an old guy. My hair is falling
          out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of
          white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube
          of fat hangs from my waist, practically
          obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and
          shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine
          even though I left the toilet ages ago.
          My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound.
          George Orwell said every man has the face
          he deserves by fifty. Does every man
          have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as
          well? Does every fifty year old asshole
          have the asshole he deserves?

<b>EXT. TERRACE - DAY
</b>
This feels real, verite. The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a
cigar, is being interviewed. He stands outside his villa in
St. Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the
hotel room, and talks to someone off-camera.

<b>                    ACTUAL BARRIS
</b>          It was 1981. I had holed myself up in
          this New York hotel. Parker Hotel.
          Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my
          life.

<b>                     INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
</b>          Ashamed?   What do you mean?

Barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks,
occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed.

<b>                    ACTUAL BARRIS
</b>          When you're young, your potential is
          infinite. You might do anything, really.
          You might be great. You might be
          Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you
          get to an age where what you might be
          gives way to what you have been. You
          weren't Einstein. You weren't anything.
          That's a bad moment. But I remembered
          something Carlyle wrote: "... there is no
          life of a man, faithfully recorded, but
          is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or
          unrhymed." I realized my salvation might
          be in recording my wasted life,
          unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a
          cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me
          understand why.

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris, now in a hotel terrycloth bathrobe and a porkpie hat,
sits at a desk and types manically.

<b>EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - DAY

It's sepia. Three year old Chuck, dressed somewhat girlishly
and sporting a blonde pageboy haircut is being posed on a
pony by a photographer. His mother stands by anxiously as
the boy totters on the animal.

</b>          Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in
          1931, my early childhood remains
          accessible to me only as a series of
          elliptical, enigmatic memories.

<b>INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY

A smiling butcher hands a slice of bologna to young Barris,
who puts it in his mouth.

<b>                    BARRIS (V.O.)
</b>          The taste of bologna fresh from the

A baby doll is set afire.   Young Barris dances around it.

<b>                    BARRIS (V.O.)
</b>          The sickly sweet smell of a burning
          babydoll on a crisp autumn day.

<b>INT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY

Young Barris is being dressed by his mother. We're close on
the velvet material being slipped over his head.

<b>                    BARRIS (V.O.)

Young Barris rolling on the ground in battle with another
boy, as a crowd of children look on.

Four year old Chuck sits at the dining room table with
several other four year olds. They all wear party hats.
Barris's father, a milquetoast middle-aged man enters in
birthday hat, carrying a cake decorated with four lit

Young Chuck peeks in as his mother sits in a rocking chair

A sixteen year old Barris lies on his back on a couch lazily
tossing a football in the air. Tuvia, a thirteen year old
girl, sits on the floor playing with a puppy. In the
background, throughout the scene, we hear the inept playing
of scales on a bass violin.

<b>                    BARRIS (V.O.)

Barris watches Tuvia playing with the dog. She gets on all
fours and yelps, imitating the dog. This excites the dog,
who bounces around her. Barris studies Tuvia's exposed white
underwear for a while. This excites Barris. Finally he
pulls an afghan off the back of the couch and drapes it over
his pants. We hear him unzip his fly.

Tuvia sees Barris fiddling with something under the afghan.
She gets quiet.

<b>                    BARRIS

<b>                    BARRIS

</b>          Yeah, well... I hate strawberries.

out the window at the dark night sky.

away.

<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Middle-aged Barris types as the camera glides over some of
the acquired detritus in his room: skin magazines, a gun and
silencer, liquor, a copy of Beyond Good and Evil, a disguise
kit, a kid's sprouted lima bean science fair project.

<b>                    BARRIS (V.O.)
</b>          Perhaps my whole life turned at that

          confirmed by the tastebuds of a ripening
          pubescent girl.

<b>MONTAGE
</b>
Sequence of young Barris unsuccessfully attempting to pick up
girls at bars, unsuccessfully attempting to cop a feel on a
date in a movie theater, standing on a front porch
unsuccessfully attempting to kiss a girl good night, standing
outside of a movie theater in the rain, holding an umbrella
over his head and checking his watch.

<b>                    BARRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And so I found myself in a downward
          spiral of debauchery. Endlessly chasing
          pussy. My only focus in life: to get
          laid, to get blown, trying to fool myself
          into believing that given the right
          combination of circumstances and
          deception, maybe the Tuvias of the world
          could desire me the way I desired them.
          I only wanted to be loved.

</b>          A constant, inarticulate rage led to bar
          fight after bar fight.

The two men get tossed from the bar.

The other guy gets up, brushes himself off, orients himself,

Young Barris, age 24, in traveling clothes and red hunting

</b>          As much as I tried, I couldn't understand

Barris enters the building with resolve.

Young Barris, age 24, dressed in an NBC blazer is leading a

The tourists "ooooh." Another tour group comes around a

girl. The two groups squeeze past each other. Chuck tries
to make eye contact with Georgia. He smiles at her, but she
ignores him.

<b>INT. NBC COMMISSARY - DAY

Barris is at the cash register paying for his food. He looks
around for a place to sit. He spots Georgia, sitting with a
female friend, and he sits at a table behind, so as to listen
unobserved to their conversation.

</b>          Yeah, I figured.

Penny walks past him, drops her keys and bag on the counter,
and enters the kitchenette. Barris watches her ass.

<b>                    BARRIS

</b>          Thirsty?

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          If you have a beer.

Penny returns with two beers, hands one to Barris.      She sits
in a chair across from him. They both drink.

</b>         So how was sex with Debbie?   I've always
         wondered.

<b>                   BARRIS
</b>             (a little taken aback)
         It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking.

</b>         No problem. I just got fucked by this

<b>                   PENNY
</b>         That's what I thought. I had a Jew, but
         he was Sephardic. You look Ashkenazi

<b>EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NIGHT

We move along a park bench, past several homeless people, one
holding an old doll, others holding other sad items. We come
to Barris. He's wrapped in a horse blanket and holding the

on his lap. The pages are blank, except for one entry: The
Something Else Game. Barris holds a pen poised to write, but

Barris is drunk and in a fight. He is losing, flailing,
swinging wildly. Jim Byrd, a middle-aged, business man-
looking guy, in tinted glasses and sideburns, watches from
the bar. Eventually Barris and the other brawler get thrown
out of the bar. Byrd takes a sip of his drink.

          killing a man, were you to find yourself
          without a weapon. The edge of your hand
          against the adversary's Adam's apple.

Another big, frightening instructor stands before the class.
Behind him is a full-sized diagram of a man which illustrates
all major arteries and organs. He is demonstrating the

<b>EXT. MEXICO CITY STREET - DAY

Renda is buying a newspaper at the kiosk. He completes the
transaction and takes a few steps with his paper. Barris
blocks his way, holding a phrase book and shaking.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY

Renda's in the back between Barris and Benitez. Brazioni
drives. Renda seems pale and nervous, as does Barris in his
gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses. The car drives slowly
through the crowded Mexico City streets. They arrive at a
jammed intersection and are suddenly confronted with a big
parade. It's Day of the Dead; the streets are filled with
dancing skeletons. It's wild and frightening. Brazioni
glances at Renda in the reaview mirror.

The car stops in a deserted field. Barris gets out first.
His shirt is soaked through with sweat. Suddenly there's a
commotion inside the car. Renda has gotten hold of a gun.
He shoots Brazioni and Benitez. Barris panics and dives
behind the car. Renda steps cautiously outside of the car,
looking for Barris. Barris grabs Renda's foot. Renda falls,
the gun flies from his hand. Barris kicks the gun under the
car, his own gun drawn. He points the gun at Renda, who is
on his stomach. Barris doesn't shoot. He's scared, shaking
wildly. Renda looks up at Barris, trying to figure him out.
He slowly rises to his feet, turns to Barris with a pleading
look in his eyes.

<b>                    RENDA

pulls out Spansh-English dictionary.

Barris flips through the dictionary. A church bell chimes,
startling Barris. His gun goes off accidentally and the
bullet hits Renda in the face, tearing most of it away.
Renda falls, but is still alive. He screams out of where his
mouth was. A wedding party emerges from the distant church.

hole in Renda's face. Barris throws up, some of it landing
on Renda's pants. He wipes his own mouth with his bloody
hand and looks at the still screaming Renda. The churchgoers
are starting to squint in Barris's direction. Barris shoots
Renda again. And again and again and again and again. More
blood spatters Barris's clothing and face. The church bell
continues to chime.

Barris drops to the floor and throws up into a trash can.
Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a movement in the
living room. He lurches backwards, knocks over the can.
Vomit spills onto the carpet.

          Chuck, is that you throwing up?

In the dim light from the hallway, Barris spots Penny lying
on the couch. She is dressed as a hippy. A backpack and a
duffel lie on the floor next to her.

<b>                    BARRIS

Penny shrieks excitedly as she runs to the record player.
She turns it on, plugs in a strobe light. "Sunshine Superman"
starts up. Penny sings and dances along, directing the
lyrics at Barris. Barris looks around at his strobing
apartment. He sees Penny's mess: pot paraphenalia, anti-war

underneath.

The bachelorette makes a mock-horrified expression as the
studio audience erupts in laughter. Barris buries his face
in his hands.

A brunette bachelorette asks a question.

<b>INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

Leonard Goldberg, a bunch of network executives, and Barris
sit around a conference table and watch a tv. On it is The
Dating Game. A black bachelor is responding to the trombone
question.   He simulates the receiving of a blow job, moaning
and writhing in his seat as the studio audience howls.
Barris has his head in his hands. Goldberg signals an
assistant, who switches off the television. The executives
look quite grim.

<b>                     GOLDBERG
</b>          Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are
          unairable.

</b>          Look, Len, the show's spontaneous, it's
          unscripted. That's it's charm. I can't
          control what people say.

<b>INT. BAR - NIGHT

Barris is drunk and brooding. He picks a fight with a big
man who has unintentionally knocked into him at the bar.
Barris is brutal and effective, utilizing the techniques he
learned from one of the scary instructors at training camp.
This gives him an idea.

charming.

          I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Peter
          Jenks of the Federal Communications
          Commission.

The severe training camp instructor joins Barris onstage.

<b>                    INSTRUCTOR #1
</b>              (increasingly psychotic)
          Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don't know if
          any of you are aware of this, but it's a
          federal offense to make licentious
          remarks on a network television
          broadcoast. The penalty for this
          disgusting, un-American behavior is one
          year in prison or a ten thousand dollar
          fine or both. Anyone making a sick,
          subversive remark tonight will be
          arrested immediately. I will then
          personally escort the offender to federal
          prison for booking under edict number 364
          of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a
          long drive to that prison. Just you and
          me. No other witnesses --

<b>                    BARRIS

There are none. The contestants are paralyzed with fear.
Jenks is red-faced, trembling.

This is the sixties and the office is crazily appointed.
Street signs, funny posters, faux Tiffany lamps, mobiles,
lava lamps, an inflatable sex doll, etc. Barris, 36, is
behind his desk, feet up and on the phone. He wears a t-
shirt and jeans and loafers. This is a new Barris, confident
and successful and hip and relaxed and slovenly. Outside in
the bullpen area we hear the hustle and bustle, laughing and
screaming of a busy but casual office.

Barris paces on the darkened set. He is trying to think. A
shadowy figure appears at the top of the bleachers and creeps
down the aisle. Barris is deep in thought and doesn't hear.
The man appears behind Barris and locks his arm around
Barris's neck. Barris is startled, choking and flailing
trying to remove the arm. He can't. Finally the man
releases Barris and tweaks his crotch. Barris turns wildly
around. It is Jim Byrd.

Byrd shrugs, unconvinced.    He sips his drink.

</b>          Think of it as a hobby. An avocation.
          Something you do to relax. You can be an

<b>INT. BOOTH (DATING GAME SHOW) - DAY

The director calls the shots. Barris stands in the back
watching the show in progress. On the stage is a pretty
blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three
bachelors. Bachelors two and three are attractive and
stylishly dressed and groomed. Bachelor one is a fat, not-
too-bright looking guy in a yellow-ochre leisure suit. His
slow, unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast, sharp
chatter in the booth.

It's all mod and colorful. Chuck Barris shuffles along,
taking in the sights with the Dating Game couple. The blonde
bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy. But it's clear she
thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention
whatsoever, walking about twenty feet in front of him and
Barris. Barris seems bored.

<b>INT. PUB - DAY
</b>
Barris enters the pub alone. He's dressed in a blonde wig
and moustache and glasses. It's crowded and he searches the
room for someone. He spots a pretty young woman by herself
at a table. She wears white go-go boots.

She smiles and leaves. Barris watches after her, then opens
the envelope and pulls out a black and white photo of a man.

<b>EXT. WESTMINISTER ABBEY - DAY

It's raining. A bored Barris, dressed normally, waits with
the fat bachelor under an umbrella near the entrance. The
fat bachelor checks his watch.

Barris, in wig and moustache, stands in the middle of the
empty, dark courtyard.

Barris approaches.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>          Sorry.     Yeah.

Barris reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out an
envelope. The Englishman takes it, opens it, pulls out a wad
of cash and counts.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you.

The Englishman finishes counting the money, pockets it, and
hands Barris a box of Polaroid film.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>          Thank you.     Oh, one more thing.

Barris pulls out his automatic with attached silencer and
jams it into the Englishman's mouth. The silencer breaks the
man's front teeth. The man makes a muffled grunt.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry about your teeth.

The Englishman's eyes are wide with terror. Barris pulls the
trigger three times. The back of the Englishman's head
explodes. Blood and hair and brain are spattered against the
church wall. The Englishman slumps to the ground. Barris
reaches into the man's jacket, pulls out the envelope of
money, pockets it, and makes his way toward the churchyard
gate. There stands the fat bachelor, watching, confused.
After the initial shock, Barris smiles warmly.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          It's Ronnie, isn't it?

The fat bachelor nods.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          C'mere, Ronnie. I want to show you
          something neat. It's okay.

The fat bachelor enters the courtyard.

<b>INT. LONDON HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Barris enters the room, shaky and scared.

<b>INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Barris rips open the Polaroid box, pulls out the foil paper
that protects the film, rips that open and pulls out a small
white plastic vial. Barris greases the vial with Vaseline
and sticks it up his ass.

peace sign. He returns the gestures, but halfheartedly. He
seems depressed. Loretta sidles up beside him.

</b>          The Newlywed Game was based on my theory
          that almost any American would sell out
          their spouse for a washer-drier or a
          lawnmower you can ride on. Such was my
          respect for that most holy of unions. I
          must've been on to something, because the
          show aired for thirteen years.

The office is filled to capacity with with hippy-like
employees watching The Newlywed Game. Many sit on the floor,
jammed up against each other. A few women are nursing
infants. Someone passes a joint. Barris sits behind his

up, and a guitar in his lap.

They break into a raucous banjo version of "Out of Limits."
Rick dances. Everyone's laughing and clapping.

As "Out of Limits" continues, now the actual version, we see
montage of Barris shooting, stabbing, and garroting various
foreign-looking people in strange, murky locations intercut
with Barris having sex with Patricia Watson in different
bedrooms and motel rooms, Barris dancing with Patricia in
various exotic locales, and Barris on the set for his many

Barris and Monica sit in first class. Barris stares out the
window. Monica stares straight ahead.

Barris leads a crying Monica down the garbage-strewn alley.
They find a doorway. Barris opens it.

Barris and Penny walk sadly through the garden.

Barris and Penny are having sex. It is gentle and quiet.
Penny is crying, trying to conceal it. Barris notices.

Barris sits naked on the bed, swigging from a bottle of
vodka, as a prostitute in a black dress and veil sings "Happy

confused.

The large man stands to face Barris. He is very large.
Barris stands. The man swings at Barris. Barris easily
deflects the punch, grabs the man's forearm and breaks it
with a sickening crack. The man screams. Barris gets him in
a chokehold from behind. The man whimpers and gags.

looks over at the woman. She looks confused.

The woman stands, grabs her purse, pulls out an 8x10 glossy
of herself and hands it to Barris, then exits. Barris stares
at the photo for a moment, then opens a drawer and puts on
top of a pile of similar photos.

building.

Barris walks down the hall, carrying a bouquet of flowers.
He arrives at Penny's door. There is an envelope attached to
it with Barris's name on it. He opens the envelope and reads
the letter.

Barris hurriedly opens the door, enters the apartment looks
around, finds Penny face down on the floor, surrounded by
empty champagne bottles and vials of pills. He stares at her
body for a moment, feeling faint. He drops to his knees.

<b>INT. DATING GAME SET
</b>
A Dating Game couple waits anxiously for host Jim Lange to
announce their destination.

<b>                    JIM LANGE
</b>          ... and we're the sending the two of you
          for three days and three nights to
          beautiful... West Berlin!

The couple screams excitedly by reflect, but as the
destination sinks in, their perplexity becomes apparent.

<b>EXT. WEST BERLIN STREET - DAY
</b>
Barris and the Dating Game couple walk along. It's cold and
gray and they all wear heavy coats. The couple wear cameras
around their necks. Nobody looks happy.

<b>INT. BEER HALL - NIGHT
</b>
Barris sits in the corner of this noisy, smoky place. He has
a stein of beer and reads a paper as a group of drunken
Germans in the background sing a song. Patricia Watson
approaches and sits. Barris looks up and smiles.

<b>INT. TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
Barris crawls through a long dirt tunnel. Telephone cables
run along the floor. An occasional bare bulb lights the way.

<b>INT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
A middle-aged man stands in his underwear at a mirror and
shaves. The stall shower pushes away from the wall revealing
a hole. Barris steps through it, covered in dust. He nods at
the shaving man. He nods back, hands Barris a gun and a
change of clothes, and continues shaving.

<b>EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Barris exits the apartment building in the clean clothes. We
see the East Berlin side of the wall in the background. A
car pulls up and Barris gets in.

<b>INT. CAR, RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
</b>
Barris sits in the parked car with Keeler, a heavyset, silent
German man with nicotine stained fingers and teeth. He is
constantly smoking and writing in a tiny notebook. There is
a long silence.

<b>                    BARRIS

Keeler keeps writing. More silence.

<b>INT. PARKED CAR - EVENING
</b>
Barris and Keeler wait in the car. Colbert emerges from his
house, alone, and walks toward the car. A drained Barris
sighs a sigh of relief, then suddenly and with unexpected
force, Keeler swings open the passenger door. The door hits
a stunned Colbert and sends him flying. Keeler races around
the car, grabs Colbert, throws him into the back seat, and
jumps on top of him. Barris watches, surprised at the
dramatic personality shift in Keeler. Keeler is strangling
Colbert. A cigarettes is dangling casually from his lips as
he does this. Keeler turns Colbert over so he's facing him,
so he can watch him die.

<b>                    KEELER
</b>              (calmly to Barris)
          Under the seat, please.

Barris reaches under the seat, pulls out a Polaroid camera.

<b>                    KEELER (CONT'D)
</b>          Please, if you don't mind, a photograph.
          To remember.

Barris is stunned, scared. He takes the photo. The flash
illuminates the bulging-eyed Colbert and the calm Keeler.

Barris types.   A knock at the door.   He looks up, panicked.

Barris looks around. The place is a disaster. Food
wrappers, crumpled papers, liquor bottles, strewn clothing,
plastic army men set up for battle. He gets up, puts on a
hotel bathrobe and his hat, grabs his gun, checks the
peephole for a long moment, and answers the door. The
housekeeper is plump and kind-looking.

<b>                    BARRIS

She puts the gun in a drawer, starts to pick up.   Barris
watches her, then:

Barris resumes typing.   The housekeeper cleans.

<b>EXT. EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING
</b>
A hollow-eyed Barris approaches the building that conceals
the tunnel entrance. Suddenly there's a commotion on the
quiet street. The shaving man is being led handcuffed out of
the building by two trench-coated men. They shove him into a
car. Barris continues to walk by, betraying no interest. He
glances casually into the entranceway of the apartment
building. Another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows.

Frenchman, sticks his head out the window.

Barris hesitates, gets in.        The car screeches off.

<b>INT. PICARD'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Picard drives fast. Barris eyes him suspiciously, fingers
his gun. Picard spots a Fiat in his rearview mirror.

<b>                    PICARD
</b>          Merde. KGB. They know who you are,
          Monsieur Barris. It is their intention
          to kill you very much in East Berlin.

Barris checks in the passenger side mirror.

<b>                        BARRIS
</b>             Merde!   MERDE!
<b>                    PICARD

Picard speeds up dramatically, but continues to drive calmly.
Barris is agitated.

          live a long happy life and have many
          dancing grandchildren to admire.

Picard screeches around a corner, then another one.            He's
lost the Fiat, for the moment.

<b>EXT. QUIET EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING

Picard's car stops at the curb. Picard and Barris emerge.
Picard opens the trunk. He lifts out a big folded-up clump
of rubber with a an engine mounted on it.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          What the hell is that?

<b>                    PICARD
</b>          Your ride, Monsieur Barris.

Picard unfolds the rubber mass. He pulls a cord and it
begins to inflate. It is an airplane, a one person
inflatable plane.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          No fucking way.

<b>                    PICARD

          It will get you over the wall. Or you
          can stay here. In the German Democratic
          Republic. I will arrange for you to get
          a good factory job. No, you must fly,
          like Daedalus before you, to the freedom
          of the west.

The fully-inflated rubber plane flies down the street,
dipping and rising erratically. The noise is deafening.
Barris lies on his stomach and steers, looking petrified.    He
approaches the wall and manages to get the plane over it.
The plane is shot by a soldier. Air hisses out.

An assistant opens the door and a middle-aged woman in pale
blue polyester pants and Joan Crawford painted on eyebrows
enters with a guitar. She begins to sing a folk song, very
sincerely, in a very off-key monotone. It's unbearable and
depressing. Barris glances over at the executive; she's
checking her watch again. The song is endless.    Barris's

shoots her. She flies back, spurting blood. Her guitar hits

<b>INT. BARRIS PRODUCTIONS - NIGHT
</b>
Barris switches on the lights, walks through the empty
bullpen area to his office, unlocks the door, enters.

<b>INT. BARRIS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
Barris enters, stares out the window, looks at himself in a
full-length mirror.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>              (stiff)
          Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The Gong
          Show! I'm your host, Chuck Barris!
              (turns away in disgust)
          Ucchhh.

Barris sits behind his desk, draws a line down a piece of
paper and writes "Pros" and "Cons" at the top of the page.
He thinks. Under "Pros" he writes "Become National
Celebrity", "Get More Attention from Stewardesses", "Even
more women will want to have sex with me". Under "Cons" he
writes: "Easier target for KGB." He gets up, paces.
Suddenly, a shot rings out. It comes through the window and
shatters the mirror.   Barris dives to the floor. More
shots, crazy relentless shooting. Barris crawls on his belly
to the window, carefully reaches up and lowers the venetian
blinds just as another shot whizzes through. The blinds
explode. The shooting stops He waits on the floor, shaking
like a leaf. He pulls the list off his desk and writes under
"Pro": "I need another hit before I die."

<b>INT. GONG SHOW SET - DAY

Center-stage is empty.   The band begins to play.   The studio
audience cheers.

<b>                    ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
</b>          And now, here's the host and star of our
          show, Chuck Barris!

The curtain rises. Barris appears in a tuxedo coat, denim
work shirt, cowboy boots and a hat pulled down over his eyes.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          Welcome to The Gong Show. Here's an
          esoteric act if there ever was one.

</b>           One that should get us our Emmy. Do we
           have an Emmy? We don't? Well this
           should get us one. Anyway, ladies and
           gentlemen... Big Nose!

Big Nose leaps onto stage. He is skinny, wearing a flowered
shirt and a sarong, and playing a toy flute while dancing in
ladies platform shoes. Suddenly he drops his flute, rips off
his sarong, revealing polka-dotted boxer shorts and a yellow
leotard. He rushes to a steamer trunk, opens it, and begins
crazily pulling out endless amounts of old newspapers.

Barris watches from the wings, mesmerized. Big Nose is
gonged. Barris dances out onto stage to join him.

<b>                           BIG NOSE
</b>             Why?   Why?     Why?

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>             I don't know. I don't understand.

Barris glances out into the audience. Something glints. Is
it a gun. He starts to sweat. Jaye P. Morgan is saying
something about Big Nose. But we can't understand it. The
audience laughs. Barris continues to scan the audience.
Someone in headphones signals Barris from behind a camera.

<b>                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>                 (to Big Nose)
             Well, win a few, lose a few.
                 (to audience)
             We'll be back with more stuff... right
             after this message.

Barris waits on his mark for the taping to again begin. He
watches the commotion around him with eagle eyes: technicians
and stagehands running around, the audience chanting "Chuckie
Baby", the celebrity panel joking with each other, the guys
in the booth smoking, the guys in the band laughing. Barris
turns around and around on his mark, trying to catch every
movement, looking for a gun, a suspicious character. The
chanting continues, louder and more distorted. The faces in
the audience turn grotesque. Barris sweats profusely, his
breathing becomes more and more shallow. Suddenly his eyes
roll back in his head and he drops to the stage floor,
unconscious.

The curtain rises. A young man with a square of Plexiglass
in his hands, presses his lips against the Plexiglass and
blows. It makes a farting noise and allows to the audience
to see inside his mouth.

<b>INT. WINGS - CONTINUOUS

Barris snorts some cocaine. We hear the act and audience
"booing" and yelling "Gong him!" in the background.

</b>          Chuck was real different on stage and
          off. Very tense. He was always looking
          over his shoulder. Even when we were
          fucking. Sort of an enigma.

The actual Gene Gene is being interviewed.

<b>                    GENE GENE
</b>          Oh yeah, a real Jekyll and Hyde.
          Sometimes nice as you please. Give you
          the shirt off his back. Other times he'd
          rant like a crazy man. I remember once
          he screamed at me that I didn't know
          anything about dancing. "Nijinsky," he
          yelled, "now there was a dancer!"

stand-up. He looks petrified.

performer. Finally he continues.

The booing continues. The comedian can't take it. He looks
disoriented. He turns away from the audience and puts his
head in his hands. Jamie Farr gongs him.

<b>EXT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

The actual Jamie Farr sits next to the pool. In the
background we see a couple of kids with enormous noses
splashing around in the water.

<b>                    JAMIE FARR
</b>          Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy.
          I think he was very saddened that the
          public saw him as this sort of spastic
          moron. I remember at the time I was
          reading Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just
          thrilled to have someone else in addition
          to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff
          with.

<b>INT. BARRIS'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Barris lies in bed next to Patricia. It's 12:30 AM. He's
chatting on the phone, lazily twirling the cord. Patricia
reads.

Barris hangs up. Patricia kisses him.       She pulls away.

<b>                    PATRICIA
</b>          I'm concerned about you. I think you
          need to get back into the life. Our sex
          was always amazing after you killed.
          Truth is you're not that great after your
          discussions with Jamie Farr.

Barris jerks up, surprised, alarmed.       Patricia watches him.

<b>                    BARRIS (V.O.)
</b>          Assassins do not fraternize. That Keeler

          I am in town on business, Chuck. And I

          friends.

Patricia glances over at Barris.   They stare at each other.

<b>EXT. LA SCALA PARKING LOT - EVENING
</b>
Barris pulls into the parking lot. As he waits for the valet
parking attendant to get to him, he adjusts the gun strapped
to his ankle.

<b>INT. LA SCALA - EVENING
</b>
Barris enters the crowded restaurant, looks around, spots
Keeler sitting at a table in the rear. As he makes his way
back, Barris shakes hands and says hello to several early
seventies tv celebrities scattered throughout the restaurant:
Carrol O'Connor, Joanne Worley, Flip Wilson, Ron Palillo.
Barris arrives at Keeler's table. Keeler rises and embraces
Chuck. He's already drunk. They sit.

<b>                    KEELER
</b>          A very fancy place.

<b>                    BARRIS

<b>                    KEELER

          wartime are remarkably strong.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          Yes.

There is an awkward silence.

<b>                    KEELER
</b>          So how is the business of television?

Barris, pleased to have something to talk about, rambles.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          Well, it's hit and miss. I've got a new
          show called "Operation Entertainment"
          which I believe is going to kill. It's
          sort of a Bob Hope visiting the troops
          thing, but it's weekly and...

Keeler is staring right through Barris.

          and laughter to millions of people. I'm
          not saying that my shows are as good as
          they could be. Yet. But --

<b>                    KEELER

Barris looks around, clears his throat.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>          Oh.

<b>                    KEELER
</b>          During the second world war, I had the
          pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I
          found it exhilirating. Afterwards, I
          could find nothing else to fill me so
          much with life. So I became what I am
          today. I wanted the exhiliration
          again... of death.

The waiter appears.

<b>INT. BARRIS'S ROLLS ROYCE - NIGHT

Barris snorts some coke, pulls out of the studio parking lot.
The sound of his heart beating pounds in his ears. Another
car pulls behind him. A wired Barris notices the car in his
rearview mirror. He turns. The other car turns also.
Barris speeds up. So does the other car. Barris panics; he
tries to lose the other car. A chase ensues. Finally Barris
screeches to a halt, pulls a gun from his glove compartment.
The second car screeches to a halt behind him. Barris
already out of his car and at the driver's side window of the
second car. He looks in and sees there are two petrified
teenagers, a boy and a girl, holding up their hands. Barris
pulls open the door.

Barris stands backstage waiting for his cue. The Unknown
Comic appears next to him, wearing a paper bag with two
eyeholes cut out over his head. Barris glances over at him.

<b>                    UNKNOWN COMIC

Barris doesn't say anything. He studies the bag. Barris
pulls a pistol from an ankle holster, and jams it against the
bag.

the guy.

She is an older middle-aged lady. Younger than Chuck, but
clearly of no interest to him. The disappointment on his
face is palpable.

Barris sits in a booth across from Tuvia. The relationship
has shifted once again. Now middle-aged Tuvia is trying to
flirt. As they talk, she touches his arm repeatedly. She
laughs at everything he says. She reapplies lipstick as they
talk. There's a quiet desperation in her eyes. Barris is
pleasant but unengaged.

closed stall door. It's Jim Brooks, whistling and holding
his Emmy. He places it next to the sink, unzips his fly and

holster, opens the stall door a crack, and shakily aims the
gun at Brooks' back.

Brooks thinks, looks at interviewer.

</b>          I'm not saying it didn't happen. I'm
          just, y'know... If he remembers it, I'm
          sure it happened. Really doesn't seem
          like much of an anecdote though.

<b>INT. CHATEAU MARMONT BUNGALOW - NIGHT

A big party is in progress. The place is packed. Late
seventies celebrities abound. Alan Alda is there. Burt
Reynolds, Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, Gene Gene the Dancing
Machine, Pam Dawber, Farrah Fawcett Majors and Lee Majors,
John Belushi. Chuck Barris steps out of the bathroom, drink
in hand. He wipes his nose like someone who's just snorted
coke. He wanders disconsolately and slightly wild-eyed
through the crowd. He sits in a chair. A man sitting across
from him looks at Barris. His eyes light up.

<b>                    PARTY MAN #1
</b>          Hey, you're Chuck Barris!

<b>                    BARRIS

Party Man #1 begins farting "Jingle Bells."   Barris   gets up
and moves away.

Barris settles by the fireplace.      A pretty woman approaches,
smiling.

</b>                 (bowing)
             It's me.

<b>                       PRETTY WOMAN
</b>             I'm glad to meet you because I wanted to
             tell you that I've seen The Gong Show and
             I think you are the most insidious and
             despicable force in entertainment today.

</b>             What is it then? To mock some poor,
             lonely people who just crave a little
             attention in their lives. To destroy
             them. So everybody's not brilliantly
             talented. They're still people. They
             deserve respect and compassion. I mean,
             who the hell are you? What the fuck have
             you ever done that elevates you above the
             pathetic masses? Oh, I forgot, you

</b>          Excuse me, I've got to --

Barris loses himself in the crowd.    He hurries past a guy who
recognizes and starts chanting.

<b>                    PARTY MAN #2
</b>          Chuckie Baby! Chuckie Baby!     Chuckie
          Baby!

Barris turns and makes his way through the crowd to the door.

<b>EXT. SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT
</b>
Barris makes his way down the crowded street. People stare,
turn their heads to gawk. We hear over and over again: "Hey,
isn't that Chuck Barris?" and "Hey, look, The Gong Show
guy!", and "Chuckie baby, Chuckie baby!" Barris smiles wanly
and nods. People shove paper and pen in his face and he
scribbles autographs without stopping. Sweat forms on his
brow. His polyester shirt is drenched.

<b>                    BARRIS (V.O.)
</b>          She was right. What the hell had I done
          with my life?

Among the fans on the street, Barris spots the fat bachelor
he killed in London. He sports a bullet hole in his head
Barris does a double take.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Wait, you're that guy. You're dead.
          This is screwy.

<b>                    FAT BACHELOR
</b>          I only want to be loved.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          That's all I fucking wanted!

Barris hurries away from the fat bachelor. He begins to spot
others converging on him: the corpses of those he killed,
bloody and disfigured. Crazy, angry-looking gonged Gong Show
contestants appear in the crowd with weapons. KGB agents in
trench coats and sunglasses wield guns, Day of the Dead
skeletons dance after him. Barris breaks into a run.
Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the
L.A. night sky. Barris dashes across the street, almost
getting hit by a car. He ducks down an alley to catch his
breath. As he leans against the wall and heaves, a middle-
aged woman appears, somewhat backlit by the street light.

</b>          Please, I'm not feeling well.

<b>                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
</b>          Just a moment of your time. I love your
          show. And, well, I, sort of, have a
          talent myself.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          You can stop by the office to audition
          tomorrow.

The woman continues to approach.

<b>                    MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
</b>          Well, I'm leaving tomorrow and I was just
          wondering. See, I dance a little and I
          was just wondering --

There's no way out of this.     Barris sighs.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          Yeah, all right. Go ahead.

Barris turns to face the woman, who's very close now. She
starts to dance around, sort of ballet-like, very badly.
Barris watches. She pirouettes, arms above her head.

<b>                       BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>          Very nice.

Something in her hand glints in the light. Barris
reflexively grabs her arm. It's an ice pick. The two
wrestle for it. The woman is extremely strong. Barris jams
the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose. She staggers
back, but doesn't drop the ice pick. Barris leaps at her.
The two roll on the ground. The woman pins Barris. She
straddles him and is about to stab him through the air.
Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch. The
middle-aged woman is a man. He screams in a distinctly male
voice. Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the
ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into
his brain. The assailant slumps over.

Barris pushes the body off himself, kneels beside it, and
pulls off the wig. He gets up, shaking and heaving. He
looks at the body one more time, kicks it in the head with
all his might.

We see Barris from above, shivering and naked in the corner.
The manuscript pages are piled high next to the typewriter.
Barris looks up at the camera with outstretched arms,
appealing to the gods.

<b>                       BARRIS

There is a pounding on the wall from a neighbor.

<b>                       NEIGHBOR (O.S.)

There's a knock at the door.    Barris crawls toward it, peeks
through the peephole.

</b>          Fuck.   Shit. Piss.

Barris unlocks the door.    Simon Oliver stands there.

          from a twentieth floor window after he
          strangled himself to death with an

          cord. Your first hit, Chuck. Your
          mother always wanted a daughter. She
          blamed you for your sister's death. And,

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Oh, and your father the dentist? Not
          really your father. Your biological
          father was a man named Edmund James
          Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your
          mother didn't know when she had an affair
          with him in 1930. If you want to look
          him up, he was also known as the
          Tarrytown Troll, because he had been
          described by witnesses as short and ugly.
          Windsor died in the electrical chair at
          Ossining in 1939. We believed your self-
          loathing tendencies coupled with that
          extra Y chromosome and whatever else you
          inherited from your father would serve us
          well.

          me at a disadvantage here, Barris. I
          don't have your files in front of me.

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          Just leave me the hell alone!

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Your mother always loved the game shows,
          and you so wanted to please her. We
          never expected the game show business to
          work out for you. But that it did,
          turned out to be in our favor. I guess
          your need to be a good daughter drove you
          more than we anticipated.

             hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me.
             I'm honored.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>             Y'know, I got a visit this morning from
             Penny. She's wanted to marry me forever.
             But she doesn't know who I am, what I've,
             what I'm capable of.

</b>             And she can't ever know. So what does
             she really love? A lie. And I started
             thinking, Treesh, you are the only woman
             in the world who truly knows me. I know
             I've screwed you over in the past, and
             I'm really sorry. I just want you to
             know that you're the one I want to be
             with. I love you, Treesh.

Patricia looks at him. Her hard-as-nails demeanor softens.
She smiles. Barris smiles and reaches across the table for
her hand.

<b>EXT. WHARF - NIGHT
</b>
Barris and Patricia stand looking out at the harbor.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>             I hate myself for how I've lived, Treesh.

<b>                        PATRICIA
</b>             Neitzsche said, "Whoever despises oneself
             still respects oneself as one who
             despises."

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>             I never thought of that. Jesus, I can't
             even despise myself with any insight.

<b>                       PATRICIA
</b>             Insane asylums are filled with people who
             think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few
             have delusions of being the guy down the
             block who works at an insurance company.
             Wonder what that means.

<b>                        BARRIS
</b>             Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I
             wanted to write something that someday
             some lesser person would quote. But I
             never did. I'm the lesser person,
             Treesh. I never said anything meaningful
             that wasn't said by somebody else first.
             I am disposable. I disposed of people
             and I am disposable.
                 (beat)
             You look cold.

Barris drapes his jacket over Patricia's shoulders.

<b>                       PATRICIA
</b>             Chuck, what's gotten into you? You're
             actually acting like a gentleman.

Barris kisses her.      She lets him.

<b>                       PATRICIA (CONT'D)
</b>             Well, it's late. I should get going.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>             I suppose you still won't tell me where
             you're staying.

<b>                        PATRICIA
</b>             No.   But I'll show you.

She takes his hand.      They walk off.

<b>INT. PATRICIA'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Patricia enters followed by Barris.       She turns on the light.

<b>                         PATRICIA
</b>             Drink?

<b>                         BARRIS
</b>             Sure.    Bourbon.

Patricia pours some drinks. There are a couple of chairs
near the window. Barris sits in one.

<b>                       PATRICIA
</b>             I've been thinking a lot about you
             lately, Chuck.

<b>                         BARRIS
</b>             Yeah?

Patricia approaches Barris with the drinks, hands him one.

<b>                       PATRICIA
</b>             I've missed you.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>             You could've fooled me.

<b>                       PATRICIA
</b>             Well, I've mellowed.

Patricia takes Barris by the hand, leads him to the window.

<b>                       PATRICIA (CONT'D)
</b>             Look. Boston's a beautiful city. We
             could start over here. A normal person's
             life. Together. Selling insurance.

</b>

<b>                    BARRIS
</b>          That sounds right.

Patricia flops down in the chair that Barris had been sitting
in. Barris sits in the chair across from her. Patricia
raises her glass.

<b>                        PATRICIA
</b>          To life.

<b>                        BARRIS
</b>          To life.

Patricia casually slides her hand under the chair cushion.
In one swift move, Barris pulls a gun from his ankle and
shoots Patricia three times, twice in the head, once in the
heart. The force of the bullets has tipped the chair over.
Patricia lies sprawled on the floor.

<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)
</b>              (bitterly)
          L'Chaim.

Barris stands and looks at Patricia's body.      She holds a gun.

<b>INT. QUIET CAFE - MORNING
</b>
Simon Oliver sits sipping an espresso. He has a black eye
and bruised face. Barris enters, looking haggard. He sits
and stares at Oliver.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>             It's done and I'm done.   Agreed?

<b>                        OLIVER
</b>             Agreed.   But if you get antsy... and you
             will.

Oliver smiles and walks off. Barris sits for a moment, then
stands, walks over to a payphone and dials.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>             Hey, Redhead?

<b>INT. CHAPEL - DAY

Barris and Penny are getting married surrounded by friends in
a small chapel.

Barris looks at Penny. Should he slug this guy?    She gives
him a "be patient" look.

<b>EXT. CHAPEL - DAY
</b>
Well-wishers, family, fans, photographers, reporters, and
passers-by are lined up on either side of a red carpet that
leads from the chapel to a limousine waiting at the curb.
Barris and Penny emerge from the chapel. Everyone cheers,
photos are snapped, rice and confetti are thrown, as the
happy newlyweds make their way to the limo, Barris spots a
pinky-ringed hand in the crowd holding a gun. Barris pushes
Penny toward the white limo. The driver stands there holding
the door open. Barris shoves Penny in, then screams at the
driver.

<b>                       BARRIS
</b>             Drive, Danny! Now!

Barris jumps in the car, the driver slams the door closed,
hurries around the driver's door and gets in. The car peals
away from the cab.

<b>INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
An ashen Barris looks back at the crowd.    Penny watches him.

<b>                       PENNY

</b>                 (still looking out window)
             Pen, I have something to confess.

Penny's expression shifts, turns slightly stony.   She's
getting ready for something bad.

<b>                       PENNY
</b>             Okay.

Penny just stares blankly at Barris, who can't look at her.
Suddenly she starts to laugh. Danny joins in. Eventually so
does Barris.

<b>EXT. TERRACE - DAY

The actual Barris is being interviewed.

<b>                       ACTUAL BARRIS
</b>             Y'know, I came up with a new game show
             idea recently. It's called The Old Game.
             You got three old guys with loaded guns
             on stage They look back at their lives,
             see who they were, what they
             accomplished, how close they came to
             realizing their dreams. The winner is
             the one who doesn't blow his brains out.
             He gets a refrigerator.

The camera holds on Barris's face as he puffs a cigar.
