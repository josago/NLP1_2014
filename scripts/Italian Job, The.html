               Half-Ear finishes up. Speaks into the headset inside his 
               gear.

</b>                         Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy.

               Half-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted 
               to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into 
               deeper water.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

<b>               TWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESS
</b>
               Coming closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John 
               Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion 
               Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at 
               a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags.

               A Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the 
               handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's 
               laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the 
               crate in the ship.

<b>               EXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHT
</b>
               Half-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride.

               Through the headset inside his gear, he HEARS:

<b>                                     LYLE (V.O.)
</b>                         Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop.

               Half-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed 
               by just above his head. WHOOSH.

               He removes a radio-controlled detonator. Hits the button.

<b>               EXT. SHIP - ON THE CUT
</b>
               The hull of the boat EXPLODES.

<b>               INT. SHIP'S HOLD
</b>
               A very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate 
               is opened. Water RUSHES IN and the crate falls right through 
               the cavity, vanishing.

<b>               UNDERWATER
</b>
               The huge, heavy crate drops down... down... hits the bottom.

<b>               ON THE SHIP
</b>
               Chaos rules. She's taking on water fast. No way to save her. 
               The captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water.

<b>               INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT
</b>
               Parked in the sand at the top of the bay. Steve looks out to 
               the bay through infrared binoculars.

               The ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to 
               the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach.

<b>               EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHT
</b>
               The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting 
               bag that is used to move heavy loads through water.

               The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.

               Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard 
               boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.

               And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...

               A large safe.

               They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light 
               at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.

               John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels 
               of the combination lock... until the door pops open.

               As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their 
               headsets, heard by all.

</b>                         "That for which all virtue is sold. 
                         And almost every vice -- gold."

               And now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening GOLD 
               BRICKS. Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one 
               is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl. We're 
               talking thirty million dollars worth of gold.

<b>               INT. HUMVEE (PARKED) - NIGHT
</b>
               They holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be 
               alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared 
               binoculars and sees --

               The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then 
               disappear.

<b>               EXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER
</b>
               The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag.

               They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a 
               hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves 
               which cause the parachute to INFLATE.

               Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing 
               floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side, 
               going along for the ride.

               Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which 
               are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through 
               the water towards the secluded beach, we...

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

<b>               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN

               The Humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the Alps.

<b>               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING)
</b>
               The gold is in three crates in the cargo bay.

               Handsome Rob and Steve are still up front. The others are in 
               the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear. They are 
               pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who 
               abstains. He holds up his empty cup.

<b>                                     JOHN BRIDGER
</b>                         My name is John and I'm a very rich

               They laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the 
               Humvee. Charlie pulls out the cigar Bridger gave him. As 
               Bridger lights it for him --

                         picture, made contingencies, covered

               Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous.

                         real.

               Bridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in 
               his wallet.

               As the advice escapes Bridger's mouth --

<b>               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD
</b>
               A Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks 
               the road. The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it.

               Click. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed 
               against Handsome Rob's temple.

               They see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, AK-
               47s leveled at the crew. Steve has double-crossed them.

               ON THE CREW: shocked would be a good place to start.

               Humvee.

               Steve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob, 
               the AK-47s aimed at the others.

               Safely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger.

               BOOM. He shoots Bridger in the head. Just like that.

               The Italians follow suit, AK-47s SCREAMING out bursts of 
               full automatic fire at the crew.

<b>               INT. HUMVEE

               They duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire.

               Glass shatters. Bullets ricochet. They're in the epicenter 
               of hell.

               Handsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas.

               Driving blind.

<b>               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD
</b>
               The Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it, 
               metal tearing against metal.

               The Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff 
               and the raging water below.

               The gunners keep FIRING. Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires.

               It almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber.

               It careens off the road and --

<b>               SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
               The Humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the

<b>               INT. HUMVEE
</b>
               Water cascades in through the open windows. They're thrown 
               around as the Humvee rides the rapids. WHAM. The passenger 
               door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is 
               swept further downstream. Through the foam and spray, Charlie 
               looks over to Bridger. He's dead. The torrent ROARS.

               Only their chests and heads are above water. And that's not 
               all. There's a WATERFALL AHEAD.

<b>               EXT. WATERFALL
</b>
               The Humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over.

               It cartwheels into the pool below, sending up a huge geyser 
               of water.

               It sinks out of sight.

               The Humvee strikes the surface bottom with an ominous thud.

               The Jeep jerks to a stop. A door opens and the bodies of the 
               two Italians, shot dead, are dumped out into the mud.

               Steve is alone now. Just him and the millions in gold.

               The water entombs them. Blood from Bridger's fatal gunshot

               They manage to get the door open. They start to swim out but 
               Charlie won't go without Bridger. He grabs his friend's body

               They drag themselves ashore, Handsome Rob helping Charlie

<b>               EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>
               A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini 
               Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low 
               to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives 
               it the legendary Mini look.

               If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't 
               bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile 
               soul.

<b>               INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY
</b>
               Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind 
               the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo 
               Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the 
               Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling.

               She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs.

               Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two 
               gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in.

               Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with 
               ease. She's right in front of --

<b>               HER SHOP

               Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with 
               the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER 
               LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a 
               poised walk she heads inside.

                         called. He has a prototype combination 
                         lock he wants you to test out tomorrow

               reading a copy of Vogue magazine.

               But as we take a closer look, we see that she's really reading

               Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers 
               the closed store. The steel door rises up and a Ukrainian 
               named YEVHEN unlocks another door. He is the gold dealer 
               that Philly Steak told Charlie about.

               Yevhen is 50 and like many in the gold trade, there isn't a 
               conspiracy theory that he doesn't embrace. As they make their 
               way to a back room, he keeps his mouth in overdrive --

                         and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do 
                         they think -- that when the collapse 
                         comes they can depend on the 
                         government? I don't think so.

               Steve motions to a security camera that looms down on them.

               Steve sees the red light is off. He lays the duffel bag on a 
               table, unzips it, pulls out three 25 pound gold bricks with 
               the face of a Balinese Girl stamped on each one. As Yevhen 
               inspects them --

                         Trilateral Commission with their 
                         twisted gods.

               Yevhen retrieves a briefcase, opens it, presenting Steve 
               with stacks of Ben Franklins: $100,000 worth. As Steve 
               inspects the cash --

</b>                         I mean, it's so obvious that in a

                         machinations, this, is our only

               The cable truck pulls over. Charlie and Lyle climb into the 
               back where they can't be seen.

<b>               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE -MORNING

               The cable repair truck pulls over, parking down the street 
               from Steve's house.

               Charlie gets out. He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a 
               sidewalk cement grate that says CABLE on it. Inside are cable 
               wires that feed the street. He crouches over and uses pliers 
               to disconnect one of the cables.

</b>
               He drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. He hits the 
               remote control for a TV. It turns on but there's nothing but 
               snow.

               He goes into the living room and checks out the plasma TV.

               The cable's not working in here, either. He hits an intercom 
               button on his telephone.

               Lyle puts an American flag pin on her work shirt. Then he 
               hits keys on his laptop and an image pops up on his monitor 
               via an RF antenna: the POV of the pin.

               She parks next to the Ferrari and finds herself surrounded 
               by the four Rottweilers. They snarl and flash their teeth

               Half-Ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the 
               paper from the fat man. The door to the building buzzes in

               Climbing stairs. From behind closed doors: TVs, crying babies, 
               violent yelling. They start down a hallway. Ahead of them a 
               door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway. 
               The door closes. They don't even get a glance at whomever is 
               inside.

               They go to the suitcase. Half-Ear clicks open the lock for 
               just a peek. He sees the goods.

               Handsome Rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the 
               door frame. Its sucked out of his hand by someone on the 
               other side of the door and disappears.

               Half-Ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of 
               the rental car. Handsome Rob closes the trunk.

               Handsome Rob keys the ignition.

               The beam of his headlights illuminate TWO HOMEBOYS. TWO MORE 
               step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's 
               door window. That one taps a 9 MM against the glass.

               Half-Ear lowers the window. The homeboy pats one hand against 
               the faux-leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches 
               the weapon.

               The homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with.

                         cap in your head.

               Handsome Rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it 
               over to Half-Ear... who nervously drops it onto the carpeted 
               floor.

               Half-Ear reaches down for the key... but in the flash of an 
               eye... moving so fast it almost doesn't register... we see 
               him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade, 
               and stab it down into the homeboy's hand. The knife goes 
               through his hand and lodges into the faux-leather interior 
               of the door.

               The homeboy suffers as Half-Ear whacks the gun out of his 
               other hand -- while Handsome Rob keys the ignition and guns 
               it.

               The other homeboys are already POPPING OFF SHOTS at the car 
               with semi-automatic handguns. Half-Ear hits the deck. Glass 
               shatters.

               Bullets slam into the trunk, illuminating the darkness with 
               streaks of light from the bullet holes. They barely miss the 
               suitcase filled with explosives.

<b>               EXT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

               The homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife.

               His legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but it's 
               going too fast so pretty soon he's being dragged. Bullets 
               whiz by him. He cries out in agony until Half-Ear has the 
               time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the 
               pavement.

               The car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over.

               The U-Haul is waiting for them.

               They get out of the rental car and open its trunk. Half-Ear 
               sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase. An inch 
               closer and they would've been a crater.

               Before the words are out of Yevhen's mouth, Steve grabs one

               face, shattering his jaw.

               Yevhen's falls to the floor and Steve lifts the brick again

               And again.

               And again.

               He then takes the gold brick -- slathered in blood -- and

               We see that the AC vent to this room is now open since Charlie 
               and Lyle have already snuck inside.

               They move fast. Charlie removes the rear panels of the 
               mainframes while Lyle adeptly hard-wires his laptop into the 
               computers. The laptop's screen lights up.

               Charlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the 
               mainframes used to be. Lyle pulls an innocent looking filing 
               box out of his equipment bag. He places the box on a nearby 
               shelf where it enjoys line-of-sight to the false panels.

               He punches a key on his laptop and the false panels and the 
               filing box quietly clicks into action, communicating with 
               his laptop via infrared. His laptop now shows a guiltwork of 
               thumbnail views from the traffic information monitors.

               Typing commands, Lyle is clearly operating on a higher 
               bandwidth than the rest us.

               Stella intentionally knocks over a glass of wine. It shatters 
               on the floor. An emergency signal...

               Charlie, Half-Ear, Handsome Rob and Lyle appear around the 
               table.

               Steve is shocked to see the men he left for dead three years 
               ago standing before him, very much alive.

               They pull up chairs from another table, encircling him for a 
               tense and pointed talk.

               The door bursts open as the burly man we met earlier is 
               dragged inside at gunpoint. Five Ukrainians armed with MAC-

               He leans forward, opens his mouth and clamps his lips over

               sprints away from the explosion.

               Lyle gets out of the U-Haul and runs to his getaway vehicle: 
               the Vespa. He's about to hop on, but something stops him...

               The sight of the vacant, shimmering, 2002 BMW 750iL parked 
               just ahead, keys dangling from the ignition.

               Draw semi-automatic handguns. Result: more madness Bystanders

               Rush hour gridlock -- no problem. The Ferrari's 12 cylinder 
               massive 210 hp engine bellows as it hits 120 m.p.h. in the

               He shifts into sixth and suddenly this car is a rocket 
               blasting off, doing a 1/4 mile in 1.3 seconds, leaving the

               Where the Blue Line rises up to ground level. The Minis

               just as two motorcycles come flying around the corner after 
               them.

               Picture this: two guards on each motorcycle with each man 
               seated behind the driver holding AK-47s in each hand, giving 
               them the appearance of having submachine guns growing out of

               accelerating full throttle for the horizon while pedestrians

               The lane is blocked by the wreck. Steve makes a right turn.

               The police cruiser hits the brakes but not fast enough. It

               cars stop just in time.

               The DRIVER of Wrangler, a muscular fire plug of a guy, jumps

               alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed

               driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel 
               Figueroa.

               With the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the 
               building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with 
               a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers

               (it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.)

               lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded 
               newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the

               with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult 
               out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted 
               palm trees.

               The motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the 
               elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The 
               elevator door opens. Some tourists step off.

               He sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber 
               across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer.

               The door closes just in time.

               A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people

               The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins.

               LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is 
               shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow 
               strip. Each tower has its own elevator.

               He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big 
               problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red 
               and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even 
               the Mini couldn't squeeze through.

               In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and 
               out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not

               over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING.

               And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of 
               the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it 
               forward --

               He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards 
               the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to 
               the last elevator, skids to a stop.

               He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his

               It soars but with a slight downward trajectory...

               Towards a large window on the top floor...

               The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of

               She can see the other two Minis are already inside. She gets

               OUR CAMERA MOVES past the three Minis parked inside...

               And STOPS at the last car in the carrier -- the Jeep Wrangler. 
               Its rear hatch rises and Steve creeps out. Looks around. 
               It's safe.

               He walks over to Stella's Mini. Pops open the trunk REVEALING 
               a silver Haliburton suitcase. He unzips the case.

               It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic 
               face of a Balinese girl on each one.

               Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. He knows his gold.

               These bricks are real.

               But as he has a moment with his gold, BEHIND HIM, the trunks 
               of the other two Minis RISE in unison.

               Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini.

               Another Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini.

               Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis.

               They cock their M-lls.

<b>               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.

               Steve hears the sound from behind him. He turns around to 
               see the weapons pointed at him.

</b>                         Get in the trunk. Not that trunk, 
                         this one. That gold is for us. A 
                         gift from some old friends of yours. 
                         They said to tell you that they didn't

                         as long as you didn't get any. Not 
                         even the toy surprise.

               The Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini.

               And for the first time, he's scared. Looking up at Mashkov, 
               he begs.

<b>                                     STEVE

</b>                         Don't worry. That wasn't the deal. 
                         I'm not going to shoot you.

<b>                                     STEVE
</b>                         Thank you. Thank God.

<b>                                     MASHKOV
</b>                              (to the others)
                         He really thought I was going to 
                         shoot him.

               The Ukrainians laugh. Steve tries to laugh.

<b>                                     MASHKOV
</b>                         No. No. I'm not going to shoot you. 
                         I'm going to hack off your limbs and 
                         bury you while you're still alive.

               And with that, he closes the trunk. THUD. Like the lid of a 
               coffin. And for Steve, the world falls into BLACKNESS.

               This causes the train to separate from the car carrier. The 
               train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour.
