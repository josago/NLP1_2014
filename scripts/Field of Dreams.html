</b>          He settled in Chicago, where he quickly
          learned to live and die with the White
          Sox. Died a little when they lost the
          1919 World Series...

</b>          He played in the minors for a year or
          two, but nothing ever came of it. Moved
          to Brooklyn in ’35, married Mom in ’38,
          and was already an old man working at
          the Naval Yards when I was born in 1949.

</b>          Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig...and the great
          Shoeless Joe Jackson. Dad was a Yankees
          fan then, so of course I rooted for
          Brooklyn. But in '58 the Dodgers moved
          away, so we had to find other things to
          fight about. We did. And when it came
          time to go to college, I picked the

          Annie: blue jeans, T-shirt, freckles. Their courtship.

<b>          RAY (V.0.)
</b>          The only thing we had in common was that
          she came from Iowa and I had once heard
          of Iowa. We moved in together. After
          graduation, we moved to the Midwest, and
          stayed with her family as long as we
          could.

</b>          We rented an apartment and I took a job
          selling insurance. I also drove a cab
          and worked in a pizza parlor. Dad died
          in June of 1 74. Annie and I got married

          could talk me into buying a farm.

</b>          It is dusk on a spring evening. The sky is a robin's-egg
          blue, and the wind is soft as a day-old chick. Ray
          Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like
          that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him.

<b>                         THE VOICE
</b>          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray looks up and around, but sees nothing that could be the
          source of this sound. All around him are empty fields.
          He stands quietly for a few moments, then goes back to
          work.

<b>                         THE VOICE
</b>          'If you build it, he will come.'
          Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this
          voice is coming from, but again, he sees nothing unusual
          -- just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away,
          the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three
          sides. On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where
          Annie and Karin sit, sipping lemonade and dreaming.

          Again, he bolts upright and looks around. Again, he sees
          nothing. This is beginning to bug him. He calls:

          there. Very quietly, he crosses to the window and looks

          baseball field at night, illuminated by floodlights, flares
          in over the lawn. Standing on the edge of the field, is
          the figure of a man with his back to us. Before we can see

<b>                         RAY
</b>          I never forgave him for getting old.
          By the time he'was as old as I am now,
          he was ancient. He must have had
          dreams, but he never did anything about
          them. For all I know, he may have even
          heard voices, too, but he sure didn't
          listen to them. The man never did one
          spontaneous thing in all the years I
          knew him. Annie, I'm scared that that's
          what growing up means. I'm afraid of
          that happening to me. And something
          tells me this may be my last chance to
          do something about it.
          (looks at her)

          think I'm crazy?

          Ray opens his eyes and turns to see Karin kneeling on the
          kitchen counter, looking out the window. Ray and Annie
          exchange a quick glance, and Ray walks to the window.

          He sees something out there and just looks at it.

          Hi es wearing a baseball uniform.

          Annie stays very calm in emergencies.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          We'll put up some coffee. You go ahead.
          Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda. The
          night sky seems close enough to touch.

          flicks it and the floodlights sputter to life.

</b>
<b>                         52
</b>          steps onto the field. On his uniform is a large "S" with
          an "O" in the top crook, an "X" in the bottom, and an
          American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve.

<b>                         54
</b>          Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in
          left field. Feet spread wide, body bent forward from the
          waist, hands on hips, he waits.

</b>          Ray's mouth is dry. He reaches home plate and picks up one
          of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls. The back
          of his neck tingles. Then, he picks up one of the balls.

          glove, and waits to field the ball.

<b>          57 AT HOME PLATE 57
</b>          Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at
          it. And misses. His face reddens, he clears his throat,
          and tries again. This time he connects.

<b>                         58 THE FIELD 58
</b>          He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a
          shortstop had there been one, but it bounces through and
          falls into left field. The Man runs in for it, scoops it
          up cleanly and throws it back to the plate.
          Ray is thrilled. He hits another ground ball, and this
          too, is fielded cleanly. Then another, which the Man
          deftly short-hops. Ray hollers out to him.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          How's the field play?

<b>                         THE MAN
</b>          It's good. The ball bounces true.
          Ray smiles with pride. He tosses up another ball, gives
          it his best swing, and is thrilled to see he has actually
          lofted one into the air. But into center field. The Man
          sprints across the outfield, and makes a lovely catch in
          short center. Instead of throwing the ball in, the Man
          runs it in, loping toward home plate. Ray's heart thumps.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Hi.
          The Man nods at him, takes the bat, and tests it to feel
          its weight.

<b>                         THE MAN
</b>          Joe Jackson.
          Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken. It is Shoeless
          Joe Jackson after all, who stands not five feet away from
          him, trying out all the bats now. Ray isn't quite sure if
          he should talk, or ask questions, or just stand there.
          Finally, he can't help himself.

<b>                         RAY

</b>          Joe looks over at Ray, now, his dark eyes evincing the pain
          his steady voice tries to conceal.

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE
</b>          I've heard that old man wake up and
          scratch itchy legs that've been dust for
          fifty years. That was me. I'd wake up
          in the night with the smell of the
          ballpark in my nose and the cool of the
          grass on my feet. The thrill of the
          grass...
          He has found the bat he likes.

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE
</b>          Can you pitch?

<b>                         MODESTY)
</b>          Yeah, I'm not bad.
          Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls. Ray can barely contain
          his excitement as he races to the mound. He stands on the
          rubber and faces Joe at the plate.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Don't we need a catcher?

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE
</b>          Not if you can get it near the plate,
          we don't.
          Ray smiles, takes a breath and starts his windup, during
          which he says aloud to himself:

<b>                         RAY
</b>          I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson.
          He makes a pitch. It's not a very good one, and Joe has
          to step across the plate to make contact, but his swing is
          graceful, compact and effortlessly powerful. He drives the
          ball against the fence.
          Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back, Jackson
          is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch.
          Ray makes the standard pitcher's gesture for a curve ball.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          See if you can hit my curve.
          °He goes into an elaborate windup, throws it, it does not
          curve much, and Jackson whistles it right by Ray's ear.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          You bet.
          Ray makes another pitch, and Jackson hits a line drive down
          the third base line. Then a smoker down the first base
          line. Ray is mightily impressed.

<b>                         RAY

</b>          Damn, this feels good. Put it right
          here, huh?
          Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches
          it reasonably close to that spot. Jackson hits it out of
          the park, and beams. Ray brightens up with remembrance.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Right, you were a low ball hitter.

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE

          I'd have played for food money. it was
          the game, the sounds, the smells. You
          ever held a glove or a ball to your
          face?
          Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound.

</b>          Yeah.

<b>                         SHOELESS JOE
</b>          And it was riding the trains from town
          to town. And the hotels with brass
          spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds
          in the rooms. And it was the crowd
          getting to their feet when the ball was
          hit deep. Shoot, I'd have played for
          free.
          The sound of a screen door turns their. attention to the
          house. Annie and Karin are coming out to them.

          Ray and Annie look at Joe for a moment, not quite

          shrills, and fireflies dazzle the night.

</b>          Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers, eating peanuts while
          Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice. (Three,
          including Shoeless Joe, are in the outfield, two more in
          the infield, one pitches, one catches, and one bats.)
          The men are all in their twenties or thirties, but show the
          sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five
          years to the game they love.
          Ray directs Karin's attention to the left fielder.

</b>          Watch Joe. Watch his feet as the
          pitcher gets the sign and starts to
          pitch. A good left fielder knows what
          pitch is coming, and he can tell from
          the.angle of the bat where the ball's
          going to be hit.
          At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls, takes
          five loping strides toward the fence, turns again', reaches
          up, and the ball smacks into his glove.
          Karin cheers. One of the players good-naturedly boos.

          of something about which you don't know
          squat. Terence Mann was a warm and
          gentle voice of.reason during a time of
          great madness. He coined the phrase
          'Make Love, Not War.' When others were
          chanting 'Burn, baby, burn,' he was
          writing about love, and peace, and
          understanding. He helped define an era.
          And a generation. And he helped us
          laugh at ourselves. I cherished every
          one of his books, and I dearly wish he'd
          write more. And if you had experienced
          even a little bit of the Sixties, you
          might feel the same way, too.

          Ray is asking the spritely Jewish Butcher for directions.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          He lives right around here. Do you know
          him? I'm a friend of his.
          The Butcher just stares back, with suspicion.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          He's sort of a tall, black man.

<b>                         BUTCHER
</b>          If you was much of a friend, he'd of
          give you the directions himself.
          Ray nods. He knows this is useless.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          That's a good point. Thank you.
          Ray exits.

</b>          I don't know where he lives.
          But by her raised eyebrows and the tone of her voice, it
          is clear that if she did know -- which she probably does
          -- she certainly wouldn't tell him.

</b>

<b>                         82
</b>          In between a deli and a Kosher butcher shop, Ray finds a
          storefront with blacked-out windows. He enters an open
          hallway in which he sees the door to the storefront, as
          well as stairs to the apartments above it.
          There are half-a-dozen mail boxes on the wall. Ray checks
          the names. He smiles.

<b>                         84
</b>          Ray turns to the storefront door. Instead of a buzzer
          there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from
          a hole at the top of the door. Next to the wire is a
          handwritten note taped to the door, which reads: "You
          better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell."
          Ray laughs. This guy is great. He pulls on the wire. On
          the other side of the door, a bell rings.
          Ray has to struggle to control his nervousness. He takes
          a breath. He hears footsteps inside, approaching the door.
          He cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of
          meeting one of his cultural heroes.
          The door opens. Terence Mann is menacingly huge. He
          glares at Ray and roars:

<b>                         MANN
</b>          Who the fuck are you???-
          Ray is momentarily taken aback, but he figures maybe the
          guy is joking, so he just smiles and plunges ahead.

<b>                         RAY

          The door slams in his face. It takes Ray a few seconds to
          realize the interview is over.
          He rings the bell again. The door opens. Mann°s large
          frame fills it.

          It is hardly fashionable, but it's roomy and comfortable.
          There are tables stacked high with mailing envelopes and
          a postage scale. A few workbenches have software and
          spread sheets strewn across them. In the back are a couple
          of personal computers.
          On a side wall there are book jackets and newspaper photos
          in cheap frames: pictures of Mann with Martin Luther
          King...with Bob Dylan...with Timothy Leary...rann being
          arrested at some demonstration.. .Mann at Woodstock...
          Mann's gruff voice pulls Ray's attention away from these

</b>          God, this place is so beautiful.
          The grass is so green you can almost smell it. Looking
          around the old ballpark, they see only about twenty or
          thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice;
          a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage
          as one player hits to several others in the field. A few
          sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts.
          Ray and Mann stop at the first row, right behind the Red
          Sox on-deck circle, lean on the railing and talk.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          It could be 1912 out there, for all this
          place has changed. Babe Ruth stood on
          that very mound as a pitcher long before
          anyone knew he could hit home runs.
          Same mound.

          row seats. They do not speak.
          At one point, Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that
          something is about to happen. He looks at Mann who is just
          watching the game. Then he looks at the scoreboard.

<b>                         94 THE SCOREBOARD 94

</b>          Right now, the display is replaced by an oddly glowing
          message. The sounds of the stadium, the game, and the
          crowd fade out.
          There is only the message:

          The message does not just glow, it pulsates. It looks
          almost otherworldly, phosphorescent; clearly unlike
          anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard.

          from the unconcerned faces of the people near him, he
          realizes that no one else can see the message. He opens
          his program and starts writing it down. Mann notices this,
          but cannot see what Ray is writing.
          Then Ray hears The Voice.

          program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham,
          who played one game fifty-seven years ago, but did not get
          to bat -- and follows Mann out of the ballpark.

</b>          It was the last day of the season.
          Bottom of the eighth, and we were way
          ahead. I'd been up with the club for
          most of a month, but hadn't seen any
          action. Just then old John McGraw
          points a bony finger at me and says
          'Right field.' Well sir, I jumped up
          like I was sitting on a spring, grabbed
          my glove, and ran out onto the field.
          They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset, and
          enter. Doc Graham's office.

          Doc seats himself behind a cluttered desk, and motions Ray
          to the black-leather sofa a few feet away.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Did you get to make a play?
          Doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk, expertly rips an
          inch or so off the corner with his teeth, and begins
          chewing.

          It hits the back of the sofa a few feet from Ray, and hangs
          there, like a white fly.

          Ray nods, and a look of understanding begins to appear on

          thoughtfully with a palm, as if it were an eraser that
          could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the
          Polo Grounds in New York.

<b>                         DOC GRAHAM
</b>          I never got to bat in the major leagues.
          I'd have liked the chance -- just once
          -- to stare down a big league pitcher.
          Stare him down and then just as he goes
          into the windup -- wink! Make him
          wonder if I know something he doesn't.
          That's what I wish for. The chance to
          squint my eyes when the sky is so blue
          it hurts to look at it, and to feel the
          'tingle that runs up your arms when you
          connect dead-on. The chance to run the
          bases, stretch a double to a triple, and
          flop race-first into third, wrapping my
          arm around the bag. That's my wish, Ray
          Kinsella... that's my wish.
          Ray begins to smile. Graham is staring intently at him.

          heard that all through the Midwest,
          towns have teams, and in some places
          they'll find you a day job so you can
          play ball nights and weekends.

          tried to get his son to make it for him.
          By the time I was ten, playing baseball
          got to be like eating vegetables or
          taking out the garbage, so when I was
          fourteen, I started to refuse. Can you
          believe that? An American boy refusing
          to have a catch with his father.

</b>          Good thing for you that wasn't his
          fastball.
          Archie digs in again at the plate, but backs up just a
          little. Now his look to the pitcher is one of
          determination.

<b>                         ARCHIE
</b>          Come on, let's see your fastball.
          The pitcher smiles, winds up and throws. Very fast. And
          right at Archie's chin. Again, he has to dive out of the
          way. This time, however, he gets right up and immediately
          appeals to the Umpire.

<b>                         ARCHIE °
</b>          Hey, ump, how about a warning?

<b>                         UMPIRE
</b>          Sure. Watch out-you don't get killed.
          Both benches laugh at that. Archie holds up his hands to
          call time, and steps out of the batter's box. The on-deck
          batter, Mel Ott, comes over.

          Archie takes his place in the batter's box again. He still
          looks determined, but a little less cocky. The next pitch
          is a curve that looks as if it's heading right for him.
          But he holds his ground, and when the ball breaks down and
          away, he steps in, snaps the bat forward, and hits it.
          The ball sails in a high arc to right center. The center
          fielder backs up a couple of steps, lopes a few strides to
          his left, and makes the catch.
          Archie is out, but the runner on third tags up and scores.
          As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline
          to the Giants' bench, he hears cheering.
          In the stands, Ray, Annie, Karin and Mann are giving him
          a standing ovation. In return, he touches the brim of his
          cap, a ballplayer's cool response to adulation.

          anymore. He leaps up and lets out a cheer of pure joy.

           which no player can pass
          -- and when he emerges from the
          shadows on the bleachers side, he is no longer young
          Moonlight Graham, the ballplayer of long ago...but Doc
          Graham, the old man from Chisholm, Minnesota. His baseball
          glove has turned into a black doctor's bag.

          other under her knees, seats himself on the bleachers, and
          turns her face down. Supporting her chest with one hand,

          from her face as she continues to breathe deeply. Doc
          peels back each eyelid in turn, stares at the pupil for a
          few seconds, and lets the eye close.

          'Go the distance.'
          When he says those words, Shoeless Joe sounds just like The
          Voice.

</b>           No, Ray. It was you.
           Shoeless joe winks and walks away, disappearing through the
           door in the outfield fence.

</b>          The Catcher is halfway across the field. Ray turns to
          Annie. He cannot even swallow.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          My God, I only saw him later, when he
          was worn down by life. Look at him.
          The young Catcher has reached the outfield grass. Ray
          walks down to the edge of the outfield.

          What do I say to him?

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          Introduce him to his granddaughter.
          Ray cannot believe how wonderful Annie is. The Catcher has
          reached the edge of the field, and now stands before Ray
          and Annie.

<b>                         CATCHER
</b>          Hi, I just wanted to thank you folks for
          putting up the field and letting us play
          here. I'm John Kinsella.
          They shake his hand.

          (to the Catcher)
          Very nice meeting you.

          field.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          You catch a good game.

</b>          Thank you. It's so beautiful here. Its
          like-well for me, it's like a dream
          come true.
          Ray cannot speak. He nods.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Can I ask you something?
          Again, Ray nods.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Is this heaven?
          Ray smiles and shakes his head no.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          It's Iowa.

<b>                         JOHN

<b>                         16 3

          as if he were asking the secret of life. Maybe he is.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Is there a heaven?

<b>                         164
</b>          takes time to answer that. He looks up at the night sky
          and searches it.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Oh, yeah...
          Then he looks square into Ray's eyes.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          Heaven's where dreams come true.

</b>          looks toward the house and sees his wife and daughter on
          the veranda, a moon bright as butter silvering the night
          above them. He smiles. He finally understands. He turns
          back to John and nods.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Then maybe this is heaven.

</b>          John starts to walk off toward the door in the outfield
          fence.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          Hey!
          John turns back. Ray is holding a ball.

<b>                         RAY
</b>          You wanna have a catch?
          John closes his eyes for a second, and when he opens them;
          there is the hint of moisture. Does he know Ray is his
          son?

<b>                         JOHN
</b>          I'd like that.

          Ray tosses him the ball, picks up a glove lying there, and
          puts it on.

          They throw the ball back and forth.

          And as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son
          bathed by white floodlights and car headlights... on the
          silent, satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of
          a cornfield.
