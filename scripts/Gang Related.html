               The N and the E are not working. So it reads the PR IC motel. 
               ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The Prince 
               Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked 
               outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed, 
               but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH 
               in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking 
               lot. Then the curtain closes.

               Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man 
               moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender, 
               sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in 
               his late thirties. Slightly nervous.

               Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is 
               forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI.

</b>                         Says here they got slips in Honolulu. 
                         325 a month. Utilities included. 
                         That's not bad.

               Rodriguez sits down.

</b>                         But I gotta get at least a forty 
                         footer. It'll handle rough water 
                         better and I'll need the room if I'm 
                         gonna live on it.

               Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci looks 
               up.

                         you can think about Hawaii right

                         wouldn't be thinking about here. See 
                         the difference?

<b>                                     RODRIGUEZ

                         But I don't want to be here, I want 
                         to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, 
                         therefore I think about it so as to 
                         not get depressed about being here.

                         be anyplace else because I look around 
                         and I see all this shit. How do you 
                         get around that?! That's what I'm

               Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch.

                         Focus on this.

               Rodriguez shakes his head, exasperated, and exits.

<b>               EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some 
               buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past. 
               We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.

<b>               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
</b>
               LIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The 
               MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN 
               sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB. 
               Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt, 
               tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life.

               She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her 
               skirt hiked up on her leg.

<b>                                     CYNTHIA
</b>                         Left at the corner.

               Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns 
               his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy 
               bass.

<b>               EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
               The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of 
               room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out, 
               leads him to SEVEN. Knocks.

               The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia. 
               She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens.

               Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.

<b>               INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT
</b>
               Divinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as 
               Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one 
               has followed, then shuts the door.

<b>                                     DIVINCI
</b>                         Hope you don't mind me checkin' you 
                         for weapons.

<b>                                     HUDD
</b>                         Hell yes I mind.

               Divinci hesitates. This could break the deal.

<b>                                     HUDD
</b>                         I just don't want no man handlin' 
                         me.

               Hudd looks at Cynthia. The suggestion is taken.

<b>                                     DIVINCI
</b>                         Okay. Check him.

               Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms. Cynthia would rather 
               not have the job, but there's no choice.

<b>                                     HUDD
</b>                         Lotta good hidin' places on this 
                         body. Check good.

               Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants, 
               sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.

<b>                                     HUDD
</b>                         Careful. It's loaded.

               Cynthia has heard it all before. She's not squeamish in the 
               least and she gives him a good going over.

<b>                                     CYNTHIA
</b>                         He's got nothin'.

               She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the couch 
               and seductively crosses her legs.

               Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight with 
               COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd.

               Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in 
               and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off Divinci.

<b>                                     HUDD
</b>                         Not bad, not bad. Any more where 
                         this came from?

<b>                                     DIVINCI
</b>                         Maybe.

<b>                                     HUDD
</b>                         Then maybe we talk again.

<b>                                     DIVINCI
</b>                         Maybe.

               Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock, 
               but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.

<b>                                     HUDD
</b>                         Told you there was a lotta good hidin' 
                         places on this body.

               Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag. 
               Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.

<b>                                     HUDD
</b>                         Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin' 
                         places, too.

               Then Hudd smiles and exits.

<b>               EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
               Hudd gets into his Cadillac, pulls out of the motel parking 
               lot.

<b>               EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               Deserted. No one on the street this late. Several of the 
               buildings are boarded up.

<b>               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
</b>
               Hudd drives. No music this time. His attitude has changed. 
               More serious. LIGHTS in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. Coming up fast. 
               Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass.

               He glances at the CAR as it pulls past him, but all we SEE 
               is the FLASH OF A BLAST FROM A GUN. Front WINDOW EXPLODING.

<b>               THE CADILLAC
</b>
               swerves into a parked car. The OTHER CAR -- a BUICK REGAL -- 
               screeches to a stop next to it. ONE MAN gets out. Moving 
               quickly to the Cadillac. It's dark, difficult to see. He 
               carries a SMITH AND WESSON .44. Opens the door. He's wearing 
<b>               PLASTIC GLOVES.
</b>
               Hudd is dead, slumped against the passenger door. The man 
               reaches in, turns off the engine, grabs the plastic bag of 
               cocaine. And now we see it's Divinci.

<b>               INT. BUICK REGAL - NIGHT
</b>
               Rodriguez is the driver. Anxious. Engine running.

<b>                                     RODRIGUEZ
</b>                         Come on! Hurry up!

               Divinci dashes back to the Buick, hops in. Rodriguez floors 
               it.

<b>               THE BUICK
</b>
               tears off down the dark street.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
               Not a great part of the city. Apartment buildings line both 
               sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the 
               buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING on a 
               MAN passed out in the street.

               Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She glances at 
               the man passed out in the street.

               His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered in 
               beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he is. 
               Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches a 
               bottle in a bag.

<b>                                     CYNTHIA
</b>                         Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street 
                         before you get run over. Joe, wake 
                         up!

               She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls back. 
               Dead drunk.

<b>                                     CYNTHIA
</b>                         You're in the street, Joe. Get outa 
                         the street.

               The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl -- 
               toward the middle of the street.

<b>                                     CYNTHIA
</b>                         Other way, Joe.

               Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches him for 
               a moment. He is truly pathetic.

<b>                                     CYNTHIA
</b>                         Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better 
                         off right there. I don't think you'd 
                         even feel it.

               Cynthia enters the building next to the alley.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

               asleep. The room is dark. We HEAR a door open and close. 
               Cynthia wakes.

               A door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom 
               apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from 
               the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is 
               VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name

                         that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely 
                         on a late fee as sufficient 
                         encouragement to repay one's debts. 
                         I am forced to employ the likes of 
                         Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might 
                         add, contributes significantly to my

                         then I am forced to stay up all night 
                         trying to convince them that I have 
                         needs, too. The point of which is, I

                         bag of cat shit.

               Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in 
               between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.

               Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options. 
               There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some 
               of his night's earnings.

               Vic takes the money, heads for the street. Rodriguez watches 
               Vic walk away. Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez.

                         explain. I was born in the back seat.

               Captain Henderson doesn't wait for a response. He heads for 
               the office -- an inner office of glass and wood.

               Divinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little nervous. 
               We can HEAR the PERSON OVER THE PHONE that he's talking to, 
               but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them.

               Divinci gets out quickly, follows him. Rodriguez is so fired 
               up and scared he can't stop moving.

               THREE AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS, all in their twenties, are 
               hanging on a street corner. Talking. Normal street traffic. 
               They give a long hard look to an ATTRACTIVE AFRICAN AMERICAN 
               WOMAN who walks past. A little chatter.

               The UNMARKED CAR suddenly screeches to the curb. The black 
               youths scatter quickly as Divinci jumps out and goes after 
               the tallest of the three. His name is JAMES. Rodriguez guns 
               the car and gives chase on wheels.

               James darts across traffic. Divinci running hard after him.

               Rodriguez spins the car in a u-turn. Racing after them.

               James darts down the alley. Narrow, dark, lined with trash 
               bins. Divinci turns into the alley, but he isn't going to 
               catch him.

               James is almost to the end when the car turns into the alley, 
               skidding to a stop. Rodriguez jumps out, gun leveled at James.

               No where for him to go. He slows down. Rodriguez moves in 
               from his front, Divinci runs up from behind. James is 
               disgusted.

               gun, but Divinci picks it up quickly with a pencil through 
               the trigger guard. James glares at them with murderous intent.

               BEHIND him. He turns, instantly reaching for his pistol.

               A drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has a gun

               Divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when --

               The drunk stops when he hears the voice. Looks through his

               we recognize Joe.

               Divinci turns away, disgusted. Opens his car door, then stops. 
               Caught in a thought. He turns back and looks at Joe again.

               Joe stumbles back into the DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY. Lies down

               with an arm.

               We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, then Divinci bends down 
               into the LIGHT. He is wearing a BASEBALL CAP backwards on

               Joe thinks a moment, then reaches into his coat pocket and 
               pulls out the .44. Divinci hands Joe the bottle and Joe 
               drinks. We PUSH IN on the BOTTLE OF VODKA as the liquid drains

               Divinci has held Joe's finger on the trigger and pulled it.

               The gunshot is deadened in the old building. Joe is lying in 
               the back seat of a car, passed out, with Divinci holding the 
               .44 in his hand. The back door is open. The engine is running.

               Divinci pulls the 44. out of Joe's hand, then shuts the door, 
               gets into the front. The car pulls away, exiting the

               Cynthia enters the kitchen and Divinci follows. Cynthia starts 
               unloading the groceries, putting the milk, eggs, etc. into

               ROWS of seats face a small platform. The LINEUP WALL is 
               striped with horizontal lines with HEIGHT NUMBERS. The 
               brightly lighted lineup is separated from the gallery, which 
               is in the dark.

               UNIFORMED GUARDS are on hand to make sure there is no 
               discussion, verbal or otherwise, between accused and witness. 
               SIX MEN file onto the platform. All shady characters.

               The six men obey. A couple keep their heads down. The others 
               squint from the bright lights.

               Heads are lifted. Eyes front. But we only recognize one of 
               them, standing third from the left. It's Joe.

               Divinci, Rodriguez and Cynthia are in the gallery.

                         face.

               Cynthia counts three from the left and... wait a minute. She 
               looks more closely. Just to be sure. Rodriguez and Divinci 
               watch her. She's obviously putting on a good show. Then she 
               turns to Divinci, sitting next to her and whispers --

</b>                         I know him.

               Divinci is caught a little of guard -- he didn't expect a 
               private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of it 
               looking like he's coaching her.

               Cynthia, frustrated, gives Divinci a look.

</b>                         No. I fucking know him.

               Divinci still isn't sure what's gotten into her. Rodriguez 
               looks over, a little annoyed.

                         You don't understand.

               Divinci is losing his patience. He doesn't want to blow the 
               whole thing now, not in front of guards and police personnel. 
               The Guards are beginning to wonder what the hell's going on. 
               So are the MEN in the line.

               Divinci leans in close to her. We can HEAR GRUMBLING from 
               the men on the platform.

               Cynthia starts to protest again, but she suddenly feels 
               Divinci's hand grip her arm. He's had enough. Cynthia gets 
               the message. And while keeping her eyes locked on Divinci 
               she says --

               as if he recognized the voice.

               Court is in session. Old metropolitan courthouse. The 
               PROSECUTOR and his TEAM are at one table. The DEFENSE ATTORNEY 
               and his CLIENT are at the other.

               The Prosecutor is a woman. Her name is HELEN EDEN. She is 
               thirty-nine. She wears a business suit. RICHARD STEIN is her 
               second in command. Richard is thirty-three.

               The DEFENSE ATTORNEY is fifty and a little on the portly 
               side. His name is JOHN OBLINGER.

               But it's the DEFENDANT that really attracts our attention. 
               His name is CLYDE D. DUNNER. He's done his best to look like 
               a law abiding citizen, but no matter what kind of clothes he 
               wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims his 
               mustache, this sonuvabitch looks like he'd kill for a nickel. 
               He's on trial for murder. In the first. What a surprise.

               We are in the midst of opening statements. And Helen is 
               keeping the JURY riveted. The presiding Judge is a WOMAN, 
<b>               JUDGE WEINBERG.
</b>
<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         -- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, 
                         entered the house of George and Carol 
                         Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber 
                         pistol in his hand. He entered the 
                         house with one thing in mind. To 
                         kill George and Carol, the people he 
                         blamed for the break up of his 
                         marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.

               The defendant is hardly listening. His attention is on TWO 
               MEN SITTING BEHIND the prosecution table. And he turns to 
               glare at them. The two men are DETECTIVES RODRIGUEZ and 
<b>               DIVINCI.
</b>
               Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right now, 
               walk over to them and cut off their heads. Actually, that's 
               what he's thinking. He mouths "You die."

               Divinci mouths back. "Fuck you, prick, asshole, dickhead." 
               Then he smiles. Clyde boils.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         George and Carol were watching a 
                         movie when he entered the living 
                         room and opened fire. George was 
                         killed instantly, hit in the face. 
                         Carol died later of three bullet 
                         wounds to her chest.

               John Oblinger, his attorney, catches Clyde's murderous look 
               and instructs him, with a point of his hand, to pay attention 
               to Helen. Clyde reluctantly turns his gaze from Divinci.

</b>                         Then the defendant, in his effort to 
                         cover up the crime, doused them with 
                         lighter fluid and set the house on 
                         fire... Carol was still alive.

               A YOUNG MAN, looking very upset, enters the courtroom, shows 
               i.d. to a GUARD, then makes his way down the aisle. He tries 
               his best to be quiet, not to interrupt Helen's statement.

               our attention stays with Helen as she approaches the table 
               to find her team in an upset. Their conversation is a tense

               Clyde's attention is on Helen's LEGS. He's bored by the

               All attention turns to Clyde. His attorney, the judge, the 
               jury, Helen, everybody is surprised by the sudden statement.

               arm. Clyde pulls it away. And now things happen very fast.

               Joe's preliminary trial. Joe is seated at the defense table 
               with Elliot. ANOTHER JUDGE, JUDGE HAROLD PINE, is behind the 
               bench. No jury. This is a preliminary hearing to determine 
               if there's enough evidence for Joe to stand trail. Elliot is 
               shuffling papers in preparation for his opening.

               And at the prosecution table is a very tired Helen. She looks 
               completely pissed off and worn out. In no mood for anything 
               to go wrong.

               dependency on alcohol. His hair is clean and combed. And 
               he's not as depressed. He stops upon seeing Elliot and Arthur 
               at the table. Both men stand. The guard shuts the door. Arthur

</b>                         And you're positive the man you saw 
                         with the gun is the defendant.

               Instead of looking at Joe, Cynthia turns to Rodriguez and 
               Divinci who are seated in the rows behind the prosecution 
               table. They are looking right at her. They wait for her 
               answer.

</b>                         No further questions.

               Divinci offers her a small smile.

               Cynthia turns away. Arthur is now standing in front of her.

                         before the night in question.

               Divinci stares at Cynthia. As if willing her to give the 
               answer he wants her to give.

</b>                              (to Cynthia)
                         And how far away from the corner was 
                         the Mini-mart? For example was it in 
                         the middle of the block, close to 
                         the corner, where?

</b>                         So you walked all the way to the 
                         corner. I assume then you were walking 
                         back to your car, yes?

                         Um... there were lots of cars parked 
                         on the street.

<b>                                     ARTHUR

</b>                         Lots of cars, but no people. Any 
                         traffic?

</b>                         So you were the only person to see 
                         Joe on the street that night?

</b>                         I didn't see anybody else.

</b>                         So you heard a gunshot, a car crash 
                         and a man running with a gun in his 
                         hand.

<b>                                     CYNTHIA

</b>                         And you're sure it was Joe you saw 
                         that night?

<b>                                     CYNTHIA

</b>                         When you went home.

               Arthur pauses.

<b>                                     ARTHUR
</b>                         When you went home you saw Joe?

               Cynthia realizes what she's said.

<b>                                     CYNTHIA

</b>                         Objection. Defense is trying to 
                         confuse the witness.

<b>                                     ARTHUR
</b>                         I'm not trying to confuse the witness, 
                         it's the witness that's trying to 
                         confuse the court. I have witnesses 
                         who will refute her testimony. 
                         Witnesses who were on that corner 
                         the night of the shooting, who never 
                         saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the 
                         gunshot, who never saw Joe run past. 
                         Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment 
                         building that night because he lived 
                         in the alley next to it. Isn't that 
                         right, Ms Webb?

               Arthur turns dramatically to Cynthia. She is scared.

<b>                                     HELEN

               Everyone's attention is on Cynthia.

</b>                         When I referred to him as Joe, you 
                         knew who I was talking about, didn't 
                         you. This case is the People versus 
                         Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has 
                         never been mentioned in this trial.

                         about, Ms. Webb?

               Cynthia looks from Arthur to Divinci. Divinci is frozen. 
               Rodriguez is sweating.

               Then Cynthia turns and looks at Joe.

               Joe looks at her, feeling sorry for her. Not hating her.

                         was the defendant?

               Cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor.

               A beat, then he lowers his gun.

               Divinci starts to shift gears, but suddenly throws his elbow 
               into Rodriguez' face. And Divinci is all over him like a 
               tornado. Slamming a fist into his face repeatedly. He grabs 
               his shirt and rips it open REVEALING the TAPE RECORDER 
               strapped to his body, recording their every word.

               bleeding from the mouth and nose, looks at Frank.

               Divinci pulls back the hammer, ready to blow Rodriguez' head 
               off.

               Divinci rips the wires off the recorder. Rodriguez closes

               Rodriguez opens his eyes, looking at Divinci, who is still 
               holding the gun to his head. Another moment, then --

               Rodriguez pushes open the door to his apartment, enters. 
               Shuts the door. Stands alone in the room for a moment, then 
               suddenly erupts in rage. Ripping off his coat, ripping off 
               his shirt, ripping off the tape recorder taped to his chest.

               He throws the recorder on the ground. Stomps on it until 
               it's shattered into pieces. He stares at the broken recorder.

               Rodriguez spins around. Vic steps into the moonlight streaming 
               in through the window. Behind him is Cutless Supreme.

               Rodriguez suddenly YELLS and CHARGES THEM. He tackles Vic. 
               But in the darkness we can't see anything. Until the explosion 
               of a GUN and the FLASH of flames lights up the room. A moment 
               of silence then --

               Two men stumble to the door. Leaving one on the floor. The

               Supreme.

               Arthur pushes the tape recorder and we HEAR --

                         fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget 
                         it. This thing... shit. Let's just 
                         get it over with. I'll just feel a

                         Then we're off the hook.

               Arthur watches Cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead." But 
               Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything. 
               And her reaction is subtle. She knows better than to reveal 
               what she's really feeling and thinking.

                         traded you... Simms knows everything.

               The recording ends. Arthur shuts off the machine.

</b>                         I think you know my client is 
                         innocent. That's all I care about, 
                         my client. But I understand why you're 
                         scared. You're already facing perjury 
                         charges. My guess is, your involvement 
                         is deeper than that. But I don't 
                         really care, I'm not after you... I 
                         get nothing if you go to jail. But I 
                         think if I help you, I can help my

               Cynthia looks at the men, then at the TAPE RECORDING EQUIPMENT

               Divinci puts aside his gun. And pushes Cynthia down on the

               TWO PARAMEDICS push the gurney down the hall. Cynthia is 
               conscious on the gurney. Looking up at the ceiling. She is

               out of an Operating Room. Pulling off masks and rubber gloves 
               bloody from surgery. One of them is Joe. The other surgeon

               move off down the street.

               Suddenly the driver turns around, holding a 9mm and fires. 
               BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. Divinci's head snaps back as the BACK WINDOW
