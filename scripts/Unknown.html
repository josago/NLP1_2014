          passengers still asleep, a few read, or stare blankly.
          In business class, A HUSBAND and WIFE, mid-30's. He's awake,
          reading a document. She sleeps nestled against his shoulder.
          He's trim, sharp, good looking in an academic way. Even in
          sleep, she's beautiful. Wide-mouthed and honey-haired.
          The plane's aspect SHIFTS, the pilot's voice comes on in
          German. The man lifts his window shade, peers out at the
          first rays of sun touching the skyline of Berlin.

          ushers them toward a waiting cab and DRIVER...
          a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in
          strength. A DELUGE. The taxi driver hustles Martin and Liz
          towards his car. He shields his head with a newspaper,
          piling their bags into the trunk, cursing.

          relax a little, enjoying this moment of forced calm.
          He catches sight of the driver in the rear-view. Young,
          female, shortish hair. Tomboy cute. Smart eyes, older than

          'Hotel' is a charitable description. Martin counts out
          sodden bills, hands them to a WOMAN behind the desk. She in
          turn gives Martin a form to fill.

<b>                         WOMAN

          A beat. Martin looks at her, helpless. The woman sighs.
          Pushes back his money.

          Martin exits, pulling dirty clothing closed against the cold.
          He scans the street, unnerved, frowns as he spots A BROWN
          RANGE ROVER, up the street, parked, idling. He squints,
          paranoid, checks the other way...
          His eyes lock on a lit S-BAHN station across the Platz.

          Martin pushes through the turnstiles, his footsteps echo in
          the empty tile corridor as his eyes play over the
          advertisements. Happy sexy Germans smile back at him... The
          SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS behind him, matching his. He slowly
          becomes aware, glances back.
          MARTIN'S P.O.V.: The empty corridor, curving away...
          Martin STOPS, listens... nothing. He starts to move again,
          aware that the delicate "click" of the following steps also
          begins again.
          UP AHEAD, the corridor straightens out at the train platform,
          several late-night travelers waiting. Martin begins to
          hurry... the FOOTSTEPS also increase in speed.
          Another sound: A TRAIN APPROACHING. Martin gives up cool,
          starts to run as the train barrels into the station, its
          noise eclipsing all sound. Doors open and Martin leaps in,
          turns to face the open door...
          .moments pass, the car's bell signals. Then a MAN appears,
          rushing from the corridor, one hand raised.

          He's mild-faced, glasses, carrying a shopping bag in one
          hand. He FROWNS as Martin does nothing to stop the door.
          The two men stare through the glass as the train begins to
          move. The man shakes his head: foreigners.

          Martin shivers with cold and exhaustion, eyes play over the
          few passengers in the car... a nondescript man a few benches
          down who stares at him, then back to his paper.
          Martin eyes him, paranoid. Slowly gives up, lets his gaze
          plays over the adverts. Times, dates... Nov 26th. Memories
          reawakened...

          Martin's eyes creak open. The train is still moving, but
          everything has changed. Morning passengers crowd the car,
          giving him space. An AMERICAN COUPLE, their bags tucked

          computer... The young man looks over, meets Martin's eyes,
          holds for a long moment, small smile, looks back.
          Martin studies him for a moment, forces his gaze back to the
          page, the negation of his life on a small screen.

          seeping from the earbuds... nothing.
          Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored ATTENDANT who nods
          towards the back. Martin moves past college kids on
          Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked "Manner," and
          what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked.

          Where the form asks for a complaint, Martin has written

          DR. FARGE fans a penlight across Martin's eyes. Propped

<b>                         FARCE

          mistake was mine. I should never
          have let you leave.
          Martin blinks, bleary. Farge talks briefly to the nurse in
          German. She nods, starts prepping a hypodermic at a table.
          Farge looks back to Martin. Explains gently:

<b>                         FARGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Confusion... memory loss... the
          complete or partial loss of
          identity... these are common
          stages in recovery. Some
          temporary, others longer term.
          We're going to do an MRI. Try to
          find out what's happening.
          Martin stares out the window, not fighting, hardly listening.
          A bird alights on a branch.

<b>                         FARGE (CONT'D)
</b>          The mind is like a jigsaw puzzle.
          The pieces fit together to create
          the person we are. With major
          trauma, the puzzle is shattered.
          But the brain's ability to
          recover is remarkable. The mind
          needs a narrative, an identity...
          a soul. Without memory, without
          a past, we are nothing. In the
          coma state, memories are rebuilt.
          In some cases the pieces move.
          In others they go missing. And
          sometimes... completely new
          pieces are found.
          The bird flies off. Martin's eyes track... empty.

<b>                         FARGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Comas sometimes perform a kind of
          alchemy. A patient awakes
          convinced of a reality that was
          previously only fantasy.

          Bleak, uniform blocks of Communist-era housing. Graffiti-

          Urine stench. Water pooling on concrete. 'Gebrochen' sign
          blocking off the elevator. Martin climbs the steps.
          Approaching FOOTFALLS, SHOUTS from above. A group of young

          Martin presses a bell. Hears it RINGING. No answer. A door
          behind him OPENS. A grey-haired LADY peers out. A beat.
          Martin tries the BELL again. COUGHING from inside, the sound
          of a LOCK. The door half opens...
          revealing ERNST JURGEN. Piercing eyes in a face far
          older than its sixty-some years. Frayed suit jacket, stained
          shirt; grey hair yellowed by nicotine.

<b>                         JURGEN
</b>          Alles in ordnung, Frau Brunner.
          He smiles. Frau Brunner retreats back behind her door.
          Jurgen turns to Martin. Eyes reading him.

</b>          Siegler used to work for me.
          Did he tell you that?
          His laughter becomes a COUGH that racks his body. Lets it
          pass, before ushering Martin into a tiny living room.

<b>                         JURGEN (CONT'D)
</b>          Sit down...
          Points Martin toward a battered chair. opens a bottle of
          cheap brandy, pours two glasses. Turns to find Martin
          looking at FRAMED PHOTOS on the sideboard...
          . a YOUNGER JURGEN in East German army uniform... in a
          large office... smiling beside a Russian-made sedan...

<b>                         JURGEN (CONT'D)

          at forgetting. We forgot we were
          Nazis. Now we've forgotten forty
          years of Communism. All gone.

          A beat. Martin shakes his head, at a loss. Jurgen leafs
          on... the piece of CARD drops from between the pages. Jurgen
          picks it up. Martin's notations from the night before in the
          train: times... dates... places.

          may be good, but they're not God.
          The question is, why would they

          could they gain from being you?

          principle: Ask enough questions
          and a man who is lying will
          eventually change his story. But
          a man who tells the truth cannot
          change his, however unlikely his

          gas. Spoons Nescafe into a mug. Opens a closet, reaches
          over a musty clutter of jars and boxes...
          finds a rusted sugar tin. Inside is a single ancient
          sachet of sweetener. A beat, pensive. He tears it open,

          Jurgen coughs again. Suddenly sways. Puts a hand out to

          as the cyanide sweeps through him. Trembling hands clasp
          the edge of table. Building force. Shaking. His piercing

          No answer. Jurgen's hands slip. He slumps forward, his head
          hammering down onto the table. A final convulsion. Then
          he's still.
          A long beat. Cole buttons his jacket. Slips on some gloves.
          Gently lifts Jurgen's head from the table top, rests it on a
          forearm, as though Jurgen were asleep rather than dead.
          Restoring some dignity to him.
          Cole goes to the mantel, wipes off the one framed photo he
          picked up. Takes Martin's Rolex, drops it into his pocket.
          He turns, casting an expert eye over the apartment... The
          legs of the stove... ever so slightly askew...
          The phone RINGS... RINGS... Cole ignores it, moves forward.

           Sleeting rain streaks the glass. Endless grey city-scape.

</b>
          Food-laden serving carts, cook-tops, pots and pans, knives.
          Falling plaster and debris... deserted.
          Liz walks through, brisk, angry. Dress torn, a cut across
          her forehead. She stops at a disposal chute, disposes of the
          sportsbag. Reaches high under her dress, comes out with a
          knife, starts to toss it as well...
          .She STOPS. Looks up, into the distorted mirror of the
          stainless steel surface in front of her.

<b>                         LIZ
</b>          .Hello, Martin.
          REVOLVING... to find Martin there. Bleeding, hurt, covered
          is debris, but holding the gun on her in unsteady hands.

<b>                         LIZ (CONT'D)
</b>          Be careful, that might go off.
          She turns to face him. Hair slicked, clothes drenched.
          Stunning despite everything

<b>                         LIZ (CONT'D)
</b>          Five years as a team... and you
          end it like this.
          Her hand almost casually moves back, the knife still seated
          in her palm. Martin tracks it, steadies the gun.

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>          Don't. Keep your hands where I
          can see them. Please...
          GROANING from the hotel structure. Plaster and cables fall,
          SPARK across the floor. Martin FLINCHES, tries to keep
          steady. Liz is steady, cool. Laughs a little.

<b>                         LIZ
</b>          You know, working with you... it
          almost wasn't work. We were so
          good... You, were so good. At
          the job. At other things...
          She smiles a little, warming.

<b>                         LIZ (CONT'D)
</b>          Don't you want to know your real
          name?

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>          Let go of the knife, Liz.

<b>                         LIZ
</b>          'Liz?'... Don't you want to know
          y real name? Don't you still
          want... me?
          She leans forward, just a breath. Warmth radiating, Martin
          stepping back...

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>          Please, just stop, Liz...
          Her face, reading him. His fear, his uncertainty... She
          smiles, just a little... Liz throws the knife! Martin FIRES
          as the blade sinks into him, sending him reeling back onto
          the floor.

<b>                         MARTIN
</b>          His hand going to the knife sunk in his shoulder, SCREAMING
          in agony as he rips it out, looking up at...

<b>                         LIZ
</b>          A soft distance in her face. A small hole in her chest, just
          below her beautiful collar bone. Her eyes find him, focus,
          smile...

<b>                         LIZ
</b>          You'll never know. You'll never
          know who you are...
          A long beat. We're not sure when exactly the life goes out
          of her eyes. Finally, Martin pulls himself forward. Gently
          closes her eyelids.

</b>
          Police keeping people back. FIRE TRUCKS everywhere, jets of
          water fighting back the flames. A collective GASP...
          as the bomb-damaged corner of the hotel starts to FOLD
          INWARD in a spray of dust and smoke.

</b>          moves through the crowd, anxiously searching the stream of
          people still pouring from the building...
          She JUMPS as a hand takes her arm. Turns her. Martin. she
          stumbles back, hands raised against him. Fear, betrayal,
          love... Him standing there, empty, bleeding...

          her tight to him. Holds on. All he has. All he knows.
