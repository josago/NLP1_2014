<b>          TNT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>          A New York Times crossword puzzle. The hand of MARY HOROWITZ
          scratches the answers in ink without pausing even a second
          between each one.

<b>          MARY (V.O.)
</b>          Vita aenigma est. Life is a
          puzzle. It is. Specifically, life
          is most like a crossword puzzle.
          There are a million reasons why,
          not the least of which is that
          life, like crosswords, requires the
          use of your whole entire brain-
          Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills
          all over the puzzle.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Crap.
          The puzzle answers all run together.

<b>          INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
          Ten plastic folding chairs line the hallway -- all empty
          except for one.
          In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best
          synthetic cardigan, somebody's grandmother's skirt, her own
          red rubber boots. Genius meets retard. She mumbles to
          herself.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Four letter word for... vomit.
          She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Not "barf". For sure not "barf".
          That's too easy. "Puke" is okay,
          but maybe a bit pedestrian (that
          means boring)... I like "hurl". I
          do. I like the way it rolls off
          your tongue -- the word, I mean.
          But my all time favorite is none of
          those.
          She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it
          together.

</b>          Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E-
          W. Spew... Sp-ew.
          A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER
          walks out.
          A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals
          to Mary.

          (a plastic Kroger shopping
          Mary jumps up, grabs her purse
          bag).

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Jesus help me.

<b>          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
          Mary stands in front of the chalkboard, "CAREER DAY" written
          in huge letters behind her. She smiles with terror at the
          class of 10 year old KIDS.
          The Teacher reads from her notes.

<b>                         TEACHER
</b>          Here's a treat, students. Our
          final guest for Career Day, Miss
          Mary Horowitz, is the crossword
          constructor for the Atlanta
          Citizen. You know the crossword
          puzzles you see every week in the
          newspaper? It's her job to create
          them. Isn't that fun?
          Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          You weren't supposed to tell them.

<b>                         TEACHER
</b>          Pardon me?

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I made a crossword puzzle to help
          them guess what my job is. You
          ruined it.

<b>                         TEACHER

          them like lost puppies.

<b>                         TEACHER
</b>          Maybe you could tell them a bit
          about what your job is like?

<b>                         MARY
</b>          People do crossword puzzles all the
          time but they don't often think of
          the person who made all the words
          fit together, and who thought up
          the clues, and who made sure the
          little black squares at the top
          mirror the ones at the bottom.
          She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds
          it up, turns it upside down, forces a nervous smile.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Crossword constructors usually have
          above average intelligence, with
          knowledge of just about every
          subject you can imagine. And it
          helps if they can spell.
          The card in Mary's hand reads "LAUGH". She laughs. Nobody
          else does. She looks at the cards again, instantly gets
          serious, sweeps her hand through the air.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Imagine, for a moment, a world
          without crossword puzzles. A world-
          Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her
          off.

<b>                         TEACHER
</b>          Daniel, you have a question?

          enough to live on.
          A LARGE KID in the front row pipes up.

</b>          You live with your parents?
          The Kids all laugh their asses off. Mary just stares at
          them.

<b>          LARGE KID
</b>          Oh my God, how old are you? Still
          living at home!
          The kids all laugh some more. Mary's on the verge of panic.

<b>                         TEACHER
</b>          Children!
          The Teacher shoots the Kids a warning look, then notices Mary
          hyperventilating.

<b>                         TEACHER
</b>          Are you okay?
          Mary grasps for breath, struggles to speak.

</b>          Water.

<b>                         TEACHER
</b>          Water. Just hang on.
          The Teacher rushes out. The kids all stare at Mary.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Yep, I live at home...
          She forces herself to get it together, totally faking it.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          But so do all of you, so there...
          And sure, I only create one
          crossword puzzle a week but I have
          deadlines, I have stress, I have
          demands on me so huge you would not
          believe. The newspaper business is
          hell. I mean it. Hell.
          Somebody's got to write about all
          the horrors that go on in this
          world.

          And after people read about those
          horrors, somebody else has to bring
          them back from the brink of
          suicide. Who do you think that is?
          She leans in close to the front row, scares herself more than
          anybody.

          tonight picking your nose and crying
          yourself to sleep. I know I will.
          The Kids just stare at her. She leans against the teacher's
          desk, tries to look relaxed but fails miserably.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          My job matters, you know. In media
          circles I am, as the Dutch say,
          geliefd. That means I have plenty
          of friends. Hoards, in fact.
          Scads even.
          The kids aren't buying it.

<b>          LARGE KID
</b>          You're a freak.
          The kids all nod in agreement. Mary's frozen, devastated.
          The Teacher rushes back into the room with a cup of water,
          hands it over. Mary sips it like communion wine. Half of it
          runs down her chin.
          Mary looks at the Teacher, fakes a smile.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          That's a pretty blouse.
          The Teacher smiles back. Awkward.

<b>          EXT. SCHOOL -- DAY

          The front doors of the school swing open and a visibly shaken
          Mary walks out. She takes a deep breath and embraces denial.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          As one would say in old Paris...
          Coup de maitre!
           A CUSTODIAN cleaning the school yard looks up. Mary keeps on
          talking - now to him.

</b>          It means "master stroke", even
          though the direct translation is
          actually "master blow"... Leave it
          to the French to pass off an
          unpleasant slave activity as an
          everyday expression.
          The Custodian doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
          Mary continues on to the bus stop.

          She lurches for an empty seat and just about dislodges her
          shoulder on the center pole. Finally settled, she peeks
          under her sweater at the shoulder damage.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Hello hematoma.
          She smiles at an angry ELDERLY LADY sitting across from her.
          The lady gives her the "don't talk to me" glare, then stares
          out the window. Mary fidgets in her seat.

</b>          In crosswords, as in life, some
          days are harder than others. It's
          true. In the New York Times, for
          example, the puzzles get harder as
          the week goes. So on Monday, a day
          that traditionally bites the big
          one, the crossword is super easy.
          It's comforting to know that
          although life can be difficult at
          times, crosswords let you off easy
          when you need it the most.
          Mary looks around for anybody to talk to. The other
          PASSENGERS avert their eyes. Mary starts biting her nails.

<b>           EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

          A frail 80 year old man MR. TAKIHASHI works alongside his
          wspapers,
          40ish granddaughter BETTY selling magazines, ne
          smokes and Pocky.
          In the corner of the newsstand, a muted TV features CNN
          "Breaking News" coverage of a high speed car chase.
          BUSINESSMEN are glued to the images as they wait in line.
          Mary grabs a half a dozen different newspapers, yells to Mr.
          Takihashi like he's deaf.

<b>                         MARY
</b>
<b>          KONCHA, TAKIHASHI-SAN!
</b>          He ignores her. Mary hands the papers to Betty.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Hi Betty.
          Betty just rings up the papers.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Did you see the review of
          "Hairspray" in the Journal
          yesterday? They used the word
          "spectacular" -- always a good
          sign. Maybe you'd like to go see
          it with rne? I have a coupon for
          five dollars off.
          Betty shoves the newspapers back across the counter, points
          at them, then speaks in barely recognizable English.

          want. I don't think the show is
          ageist. That means he won't feel
          like a loser for being old.
          As she takes her time paying, Mr. Takihashi madly gestures
          about Mary holding up the line. Betty barks at her.

<b>                         BETTY
</b>          Pecha kucha! Do Itta!
          Betty takes Mary's money, waves her on and helps the next
          customer.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          So no then? That's a no?
          Betty ignores her. Mary waits, loads the newspapers into her
          bag.

<b>          MARY (V.O.)
</b>          Sometimes crosswords are even
          better than life. Here's how.
          They don't discriminate.
          Crosswords don't care if you're
          young or old; black or white; male,
          female or intersex. Crosswords
          only care if you're an idiot. And,
          really, that's okay, because if you
          have the IQ of a yam, finishing a
          crossword should be the least of
          your worries.
          Mary glances up at the TV news once more, then walks away.

          An 1890 Colonial Revival home surrounded by White Oaks.
          Oversized statue of the Blessed Virgin in the flower bed.
          Mezuzah on the door.
          Face still in the newspaper, Mary trips up the steps and
          skids onto the porch. Her knee starts to bleed.

</b>
           It's house that's been lived in. Every inch cluttered with
           old newspapers, family photos, various objet d'art, and
          books, books and more books.
           Mary steps out of her boots and marches into the living room
          where her 50ish mother, MRS. HOROWITZ, sits reading with MR.
          HOROWITZ (late 50's, professorial head to toe, furrowed brow
          to worn loafers).

<b>                         MARY
</b>          "Brilliant" is what they said.
          Never in the history of St.

          children's brains been so
          inordinately stimulated as they
          were today by my presentation.

<b>          MRS. HOROWITZ
</b>          Good for you, sweetie.
          Mary pulls the newspapers out of her bag, sorts through them,
          stacks them on top of the TV.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          "Inspired", the teacher told me.

<b>          MR. HOROWITZ

          She hands him the paper.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          "Engrossing" one child exclaimed.

<b>          MR. HOROWITZ

          "ebullient"-

<b>          MR. HOROWITZ
</b>          What happened to your knee?
          Mary looks down at the blood dripping down from her knee onto
          her sock. She's completely annoyed - more at the question
          than the mess.

          off for their labors. I'm lucky to

          Mary hands over the last newspaper, heads out to the hallway.
          Her mother yells to her.

<b>          MRS. HOROWITZ
</b>          Change those socks before your
          date.

<b>                         MARY

          Mary walks up the stairs.

<b>          MRS. HOROWITZ
</b>          Mary, it's just a date. This is
          what normal girls your age do.
          Mary stops on the stairs.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I'm normal.
          Silence from her parents. Mary marches back into the living
          room.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          In fact, I'm normalis extremes.
          That's the kind of normal that
          doesn't get more normal.

          father. Mary's mind reels, like her head is going to
          explode. Finally, a determination hits her.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I'll go.
          Mary bolts up the stairs to her room.
          Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz look at each other, surprised, happy.

<b>          MR. HOROWITZ
</b>          You ever want to see grandchildren,

          She swats him with her book, tries not to laugh.

<b>          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Storage room or bedroom? Boxes and books all over the place.
           In the middle of it all, a bed.
           On the dresser, a bunch of photos of Mary Tyler Moore in the - MTM in a
          1970's. Taped to the mirror, the chosen photo Horowitz
           smart blue sweater and skirt ensemble. An
           wears the exact same outfit. Oddly,
           surprisingly current and actually hot.
           She leans over the gerbil cage next to her desk, taps to wake
          up the :Lone, fat occupant.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Carol, tonight I have a date. A

          situation. We are, as yet, unknown
          to one another... It's nerve
          wracking, I know. Try not to have
          a spontaneous epileptiform seizure.
          The doorbell rings. Mary freezes, listens for the muffled
          voices downstairs.
          She sits on the corner of her bed and breathes rapidly into a
          paper bag.
          There's a knock on her bedroom door. Mary folds up the bag,
          puts it in her pocket for later, then opens the door a crack.
          It's her mother.

<b>          MRS. HOROWITZ

          Mrs. Horowitz opens the door wider, takes a look at Mary,
          looks like she's going to cry.

<b>          MRS. HOROWITZ
</b>          Look at you.

<b>                         MARY

<b>          MRS. HOROWITZ
</b>          Beautiful and smart. And fun. And
          interesting.
          Mary takes a deep breath, lets it out fast.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Let's hope all that does it for
          him.

<b>          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          A bored, CNN jacket wearing Steve looks up to see Mrs.
          Horowitz descending the stairs. Not far behind, Mary takes
          each step like her knees are fused together but still manages
          to look hot. Steve's pleasantly surprised.
          With one look at Steve, Mary's eyes glaze over as if a choir
          is screaming "hallelujah" in her brain.
          As Mary reaches the bottom step --

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Mary, hi. I'm Steve.
          She puts up a finger - "just a second".
          She turns around and runs back upstairs. Steve looks at Mrs.
          Horowitz, confused.

<b>          MRS. HOROWITZ

          Mary runs into her room, kneels down in front of the mizrach
          and crucifix on the wall. Hands clasped in prayer.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Gods. You may have noticed that

          Translation: I'm really trying and
          thus should be amply rewarded.
          Thanks for your support.
          She gets up, has a second thought, gets back onto her knees.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          And by support I don't mean, you
          know -
          She hikes up her bra.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I mean your assistance, your
          furtherance, your advocacy of my
          efforts to get out there and... do
          what I'm supposed to do.
          She concentrates hard, opens her eyes. Now she's ready.

<b>          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Steve waits as Mary walks down the stairs again, this time a
          bit more relaxed.

<b>          MRS. HOROWITZ
</b>          There we go.
          Mary makes it to the bottom of the stairs, steps into her red
          boots. Her mother cringes. Steve's a bit surprised at the
          boots but who cares, Mary's still hot from the knee caps up.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Ready?
          Mary nods a bunch of times.

<b>          MRS. HOROWITZ
</b>          Be careful now. Don't forget your
          seatbelts.
          Mrs. Horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the
          living room. She waves to them out the window, trying to
          hide her worry but failing miserably.

<b>          MR. HOROWITZ
</b>          She'll be fine.
          They look at each other - a bit of hope, a bit of dread.

          Steve unlocks the driver's side door of his SUV while Mary
          waits at her door, nervous but smiling.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Sorry about this blind date thing.
          My mother -

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I never went to kindergarten!
          He looks at her, totally confused.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          They skipped me to the forth grade.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Okay.
          She gets in the car, fastens her seatbelt. Steve hesitates
          then heads to the driver's side, gets in.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I missed finger painting.
          He has no clue what to say.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Me too.
          She lunges for his lips but the seatbelt snaps her back
          inches short.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Whoa!
          Undeterred by the whiplash, Mary undoes her seatbelt and
          tries again, this time making contact with Steve's lips.
          He's more than a little startled but kisses her back anyway,
          all the while straining to see the Horowitz house.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Mary... uh, what about your mother?
          She straddles him and keeps kissing.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          You're not her type. And she's
          married.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          No, we're right in front of your
          house and...
          She undoes her sweater.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          And I have no problem with that
          whatsoever.
          She kisses his neck. He looks up with a "thank you, God".

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Steve?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Mary.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Is it Steven with a V or Stephen
          with a P-H?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>
<b>          V.
</b>          She works over his face over like it's an ice cream cone.

<b>          18.
</b>
<b>                         MARY
</b>          I thought so. There are almost a
          million Stevens with a V in the
          country, you know. It's much more
          popular than the P-H way, almost
          twice as popular in fact. I think
          it's the Brits who prefer the P-H.
          They love their P-H's over there.
          Not as much as they love their fish
          and chips but still, they love
          them. It was the media thing, you
          know, that's why our moms wanted us
          to get together. You work in the
          media, so do I. We really have to
          hand it to our moms, Steve, we do,
          and not just for raising us, or for
          thriving during a time when women
          painstakingly struggled for
          equality, but I mean we should hand
          it to them for being visionaries
          and predicting our all encompassing
          compatibility. We're
          professionally compatible, yes, but
          it's occurring to me at this
          particular moment that we're also
          sexually compatible, and I don't
          know if you noticed like I noticed
          but we're also both wearing blue.
          What are the chances of that?
          Actually, if I really think about
          it, the chances are probably pretty
          good. Blue is one of the most
          popular three colors, however,
          yours is-
          She leans forward and checks the fabric tag on the neck of
          his jacket. She can't quite read it. She reaches up and
          flips on the interior light. Steve's just about blinded.
          She grabs the tag, reads.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Nylon. And mine...
          She grabs her own tag and reads it, just about elbowing Steve
          in the eye.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Polyester! See? Both synthetic
          fibres! And the chances of that
          are much smaller than the chances
          of us just wearing blue.
          Steve looks at Mary - suddenly fully aware of her craziness.

          She just about jumps out of her pants with excitement.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Me too! And semantics, the study

          keeps pointing to the seedling - which happens to be right in
          front of the Botanist's generous breasts.
          The camera gets closer and closer - each time it pulls away
          Hartman points to the seedling again to force the camera in
          close - basically turning the piece into a giant boob-fest.

          She looks at her parents. They sit at a table playing bridge
          with MR. and MRS. HANCOCK.

          Mr. Hancock checks out Mary's bare legs as she stands in a
          puddle of bath water. Mrs. Hancock lifts her husband's chin,
          snaps him out of it.

          her mother then jumps up onto the first step of the bus. Mr.

          Local and national NEWS CREWS are camped across the road from
          the Medieval Times castle. Among them, Steve holds the CNN

          on his fellow performers. Twenty-

          employees are still being held
          hostage by the assailant, their

          of eight medieval Times dinner
          theatre restaurants. Guests who
          cross the drawbridge enjoy a
          medieval style feast while watching
          the main attraction: knights
          engaging in a battle of strength
          and skill. The restaurant promises
          "fun, feasting and fighting" but it
          appears that this time, fun was in
          short supply.
          A few feet away, Angus frantically takes notes as he talks to
          a MAINTENANCE WORKER, then slips a piece of paper to Hartman.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          Paula, devastating news just in.
          We have one confirmed death - an
          Andalusian - a purebred Spanish
          horse. One of many that perform in
          the show, and the first innocent
          victim of a rogue knight's rage...
          He takes a moment to fake compose himself, barely getting the
          words out.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          At times like this, I like to think
          there's a heaven just for horses.
          A rolling meadow, lush grasses,
          unlimited supply of... those things
          horses like to lick - or is that
          cows? Nevertheless, a beautiful,
          peaceful place.
          He turns and looks toward to the Medieval Times.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          May you long roam in that heaven,
          noble horse -
          Angus hands him another note. Hartman scans it, instantly
          kills the fake anguish.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          But not quite yet. We're the first
          to report, the horse is not dead,
          Paula. Not dead. The horse is
          alive and well after having merely
          fainted, as it was trained to do
          for the show. One happy, blessed
          miracle...

          his 60's beside her. The light above their seats illuminates
          the crossword puzzle he's working on. Mary looks over his

          which does not, as one might think,
          have anything to do with pigs.
          It's actually a raw iron made from

          - and by coke I mean the
          carbonaceous residue, not the cola,

          Perhaps the greatest obstacle the
          hostage negotiators face is the
          suspect's refusal to communicate
          using modern day technology. In
          keeping with his role as a medieval
          knight, he's insisting on an
          eleventh century messenger to
          deliver all communication.
          The screen splits with a female news ANCHOR.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Carrier pigeons, despite their

          anything. Homing pigeons are
          better for messenger work...
          The Diners lose interest. Mary catches the eye of a WANDERER
          at the end of the counter. He's hanging on her every word.

<b>                         MARY

          writes Norm's license number in huge print down her arm.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Norm, if you're going to rape and
          murder me, you'll have to cut me up
          into a million chunks and scatter
           me all over four states, otherwise
          this appendage -
          She holds her arm up, shows him.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Will lead homicide detectives right
          to you.
          She smiles at him warmly, puts the marker back in her bag.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          And you already told me you don't
          have a light to burn the flesh off.
          Norm can't believe this. Before he can say a word, Mary
          moves around to the passenger side, hops up into the truck.
          She notices some snacks on the dash.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Moon Pies! Want to go halfsies?
          At a loss, Norm motions for Mary to help herself. As she
          unwraps a Pie, he reluctantly starts up the truck.

          Dozens of local and national news vans line the streets

          A long line of news crews, views of the hospital's admitting
          entrance behind them. At one end of the line, a male KOCO
          (Oklahoma) REPORTER talks to camera.

<b>          KOCO REPORTER
</b>          Eleven months ago, the child we've
          come to know as Baby Peggy was born
          with an extremely rare birth
          defect, a third leg. Shortly after
          the birth, her parents Misty and
          Bill Dunlevy separated. Now with
          joint custody, one parent wants the
          baby to keep the third leg, the
          other wants it gone...
          A few feet away, a female FOX NEWS REPORTER is on camera.

<b>          FOX NEWS REPORTER

          scheduled for Wednesday but the
          father, Bill Dunlevy, isn't about
          to give up. As his lawyers work to

          to keep it." But for now, the fate
          of that precious child's third leg
          is the hands of a judge... This is
          Hartman Hughes reporting, live from
          Oklahoma City.
          Steve signals they've cut, lowers his camera. Hartman calls
          out to Angus.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          What if next time I say Baby Peggy
          is like the wishbone of her
          parents' dispute?
          Hartman acts out a wishbone pull. Steve's disgusted.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Yeah, go ahead and suggest that.
          Corbitt will love it.
          Steve turns and looks toward the edge of the fenced off
          hospital grounds. Dozens of PROTESTORS are camped out - a
          sorry assortment of oddballs standing at the fence, waving
          their signs: "SPARE THE LEG", and "HONOR THE FATHER". Many
          of them carry drawings of a three legged baby wearing a halo.
          Steve braces himself and heads for the crowd. Half way
          across, he spots a loner walking from the parking lot. He's
          35, chubby, his shirt buttoned one button off so it hangs
          lower on the left. This is HOWARD. In one hand: a pro-leg
          sign. In his other hand: a carton of chocolate milk.
          Howard stops to lick up the chocolate milk spilling all over
          his arm. Steve catches up with him.

<b>                         STEVE

          It's an impressively detailed drawing of a judge yanking a
          baby's third leg off.

<b>                         HOWARD

<b>          EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY

          Mary steps onto the hospital grounds and looks all around her
          - NEWS CREWS circulate, PATIENTS and staff walk in and out of
          the hospital, protestors line the fence. Somewhere in the
          middle, she finds what she's hunting for -- Steve.
          Mary's face lights up and she starts running toward him - in
          her mind, no doubt in slow motion, with clouds parting to
          light her way.
          Steve's attention is drawn away from the interview with
          Howard. He spots Mary running toward him, arms outstretched.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Please God, no.
          He looks for a place to hide but she's running ridiculously
          fast. It's too late. She's only a few feet away.

</b>          Steve!
          She jumps into his arms but he's only got one arm free and
          isn't about to use it to catch her. She slides down his leg
          to the ground but quickly picks herself up.

          and dress shoes, sneaks out the door unnoticed.

          Steve looks back, a bunch of people stare. Mary waves to him
          then watches until he's out of sight.
          A SECURITY GUARD approaches her.

          Mary turns to see what he's pointing at - the growing crowd
          of protestors off in the distance. They wave their signs
          around, cry, sing and sway together, their painful song
          barely audible from afar.

          another protestor's backpack thermos. She finishes pouring,
          taps the guy on the shoulder.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Thanks, Bruno.
          He walks away. Mary takes a sip of the hot chocolate, burns
          her mouth.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Crap.
          She grabs her tongue with her fingers. Hartman appears right
          in front of her.

</b>          M'lady.
          She's a bit stunned and star struck. He offers his hand.

</b>          Hartman Hughes.
          Mary lets go of her tongue, uses her saliva covered hand to

          Hartman reflects on it, smiles.

</b>          Me, of course me, but every once in
          a while some of them try to land
          Steve. It's true. Sure he'll go
          for a few skanks here and there but
          it's all just a sad attempt to hide
          his fear. All he wants is to love
          but he's afraid of opening up,
          afraid of putting himself out
          there, afraid of somebody like you,
          Mary - yes you - afraid of you
          breaking his heart. Can you blame
          him?
          She's a bit stunned and confused by all of this.

</b>          No! Promise me this. Promise
          you'll stick around long enough to
          help him get over that fear. He
          tells you to go away, don't. He
          says he thinks you're crazy?
          You're not. He's crazy, Mary.
          Crazy not to let down his walls and
          tell you how he really feels. Can
          I count on you to hang in there no
          matter what?

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Of course. I don't want to
          interfere in his work but I just
          need to be here for him and -
          He grabs her, hugs her in so her words are all muffled - and
          yet she keeps talking.

          The SECURITY GUARD walks past, gestures that they should be
          behind the fence. Hartman holds up his press pass to get rid
          of the Guard, then lets go of Mary. He points her toward the
          protestors, starts backing away.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          I'll tell Steve to come find you
          when we wrap for the day. What
          side are you on?

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Pro-leg.
          She shows him her button featuring a cartoon of a very happy
          three legged baby. Hartman laughs.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          You might want to jump camps. No
          way they're going let that baby
          keep the third leg and live like a
          freak. Trust me.
          He waves and turns around, starts heading for the press camp.
          Mary calls out to him.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          She'd just be like the tree frogs.
          Hartman turns around. What?

</b>          A trematode parasite causes
          polymely (that means extra limbs)
          in tree frogs. It happens all the
          time. In some ponds there's like a
          quarter of the tree frogs with
          extra legs. Totally natural.

          hidden.

</b>          Exactly what I told him, but the

          Only a few protestors remain. Abandoned signs and garbage
          cover the grass. Elizabeth gets autographs from other

          sick, not as in rad, although he is
          that too, but more like unwell,
          infirm, perhaps barfy. Hopefully
          nothing serious but you never can
          be too sure and besides, healthy or
          not, he needs me.

          Mary is stunned. She takes a minute to realize it's real,
          gets excited. From behind her:

<b>          HOWARD (O.S.)
</b>          I'll go too.
          Mary turns around and spots Howard.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>          Mary, have you met Howard?
          Mary shakes her head. Howard offers his hand. It's got
          dried chocolate milk all over it. She takes it.

          Elizabeth and Howard each pick up a Baby Peggy sign off the
          ground. Mary grabs as many as she can hold -- way, way too
          many. A bunch of them slide off but she perseveres.

          Howard starts the car. In the passenger seat, Elizabeth has
          a bunch of the protest signs crammed in at her feet.
          Mary gets settled in the back seat, spots a copy of
          Scientific American magazine, then finds an apple stuck
          behind the seat belt. She yanks the apple out, looks at it.
          Howard looks at her in the rear view mirror.

</b>          You can have that. I have more.

<b>                         MARY

          Mary puts the apple in her Kroger bag.

</b>          This tragedy began eight months ago
          in what was once paradise - the
          Elysium Sanctuary outside of Taos,
          New Mexico. For years, celebrities
          considered the five star meditation
          resort the only true place for
          spiritual purification, and with
          good reason. Nestled in the heart
          of reclaimed Pueblo Indian lands,
          the Elysium Sanctuary promised one
          thing - enlightenment.
          A COURT TV REPORTER is on camera a few feet away.

<b>          COURT TV REPORTER
</b>          But the Elysium Sanctuary would
          never be the same after tragedy
          struck last winter. Twenty-six
          year old resort masseuse Juan
          Carlos Velasquez found stabbed to
          death in the meditation villa of
          beloved star of stage and screen,
          Cloris Leachman.

</b>          Publicists for the eighty year old
          Leachman insist her relationship
          with the deceased Velasquez was no
          different than with the dozens of
          other resort personnel attending to
          Ms. Leachman during her solitude
          retreat.
          At the end of the row, Hartman reports.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          But the octogenarian Leachman may
          not have been as innocent as her
          representatives claimed, at least
          according to the evidence found at
          the murder scene.

          CLORIS", "JAIL REAL CRIMINALS, NOT OLD LADIES" and "OSCAR
          WINNERS DON'T KILL", with photos of Cloris Leachman through
          the years.
          On the other side of the crowd, a smaller group of MEXICAN

          Unwashed hair, bed head, and there's a chunk of a Twinkie

</b>
          In full rain gear, Hartman walks past rows of boarded up
          businesses. Steve follows him with the camera. Angus, Doug
          and Josh are close behind.
          The rain is deafening, the wind ridiculous. It's all Hartman
          can do to stay on his feet.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          (yelling his head off)
          And this time, the warnings were
          hard to ignore. One Galvestonian
          told us "tornados, we can handle.
          Hurricanes we can handle. Bugs we
          can handle. Put 'em all together
          and that's a storm I don't need to
          see". A wise man indeed.
          Something off to the side catches Hartman's eye -- it's a
          picnic table blowing down the street.

          Steve gets the shot then pretends to make adjustments to his
          camera while he discretely scans the area, on the lookout for
          Mary.

<b>          INT. HOWARD'S CAR ON 1-45 TO GALVESTON TX - DAY
</b>
          Howard and Mary can barely see out the window. The car
          inches along.
          Mary digs in a KFC bag, takes out a handy wipe, starts
          cleaning her body with it.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          And when I met Steve, I knew right
          away we had a lot in common. We're
          both in the media, we both love
          crosswords, we both love words. We
          both felt this unexplainable
          connection, no matter how much his
          instinct might be to fight it.
          That's okay. We just have to get
          to know each other better, that's
          all.
          She uses the wipe on her face, gets a bit on her lip and the
          taste is awful. She rolls down the window, closes her eyes
          and gently sticks her face out to rinse with rain water.
          The car hits a flooded patch of the road. A wave of mud
          washes up and smacks Mary right in the face.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Crap.
          She starts the handy wipe bath all over again. A nervous
          Howard speaks up.

<b>                         HOWARD
</b>          I saw Steve talking to you... He
          wasn't very nice.
          Mary makes herself busy putting the handy wipe in her Kroger
          bag then looks out the window.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          If there's one thing I learned from

          She looks at Howard.

          window.

<b>          EXT. GALVESTON PIER - DAY
</b>
          Hartman stands in the middle of a pier that looks moments
          away from being carried out to sea. Steve shoots from a spot
          on the pier a few feet closer to shore but not much safer.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          Paula, this pier was closed to the
          public twenty-four hours ago, and
          for good reason.
          Steve inches a bit closer for the shot, his footing unstable.
          Josh moves in and hangs on to Steve to keep him steady.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          As I stand here, I can actually
          feel the structure moving under my
          feet. The only thing between me
          and the limitless depths of the sea
          is this two-by-four railing that -
          The railing flies off. Hartman drops to his knees and crawls
          to the other railing then hangs on for dear life. Steve and
          Josh struggle to hang on to the camera and each other.

</b>          Steve signals,to Hartman to wrap it up fast. Hartman talks
          slower than ever.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          And Paula I have to tell you, not
          only has my hearing been
          permanently damaged by the sheer
          force of the rain hitting my
          eardrums, but at this point, I'm
          beginning to wonder if I'll even
          make it out alive.
          He raises his head up for the big finish, gets hammered by
          the wind and rain.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          This is Hartman Hughes, reporting
          live from Galveston, Texas.
          Steve and Josh start backing up off the pier with Hartman
          crawling behind them. Steve yells back to him.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          You had to get the pier shot. Had
          to. Just about got us all killed.
          Happy?
          Hartman points in the water, yells.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>
<b>          OH MY GOD! IT'S MARY!
</b>          Steve jumps, looks to where Hartman is pointing -- it's a
          plastic bag floating by in the water.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          You're such an asshole.
          Steve walks off the pier mad as hell.

<b>                         HARTMAN
</b>          Come on, that was funny. You have
          to admit... Stevie?

          his face.

<b>                         HOWARD
</b>          Hang on.
          He hits the brakes, starts backing up as quickly as possible.
          Mary looks ahead -- sees what looks like a tornado up ahead.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Oh my God.
          Howard backs under an overpass, points to a protected area up
          the cement embankment.

<b>          EXT. 1-45 OVERPASS - DAY

          Mary and Howard run up the cement embankment as the rain and
          winds swirl all around them.

</b>          We'll just have to wait for this to
          pass, then we'll keep going. It'll
          be okay.
          They look down to the road just in time to see Howard's car
          picked up and blown right through the underpass, landing on
          its side in a ditch fifty yards away.

          up his laptop.

          As the storm calms around them, Howard and an exhausted Mary
          crouch in the sheltered area. They use a little flashlight
          on Mary's keychain to watch debris blowing by.

<b>                         MARY

          Mary points to a steel belted tire on the ground, lays back
          and shuts her eyes. Howard takes something out of his - it's a
          pocket, puts it in her hand. Mary looks at it
          shrivelled, sculpted apple head. She smiles, hardly able to
          keep her eyes open.

          bored. Now I just make these and

          Science is her life. Not like my
          girlfriend in Tacoma. She's really
          into Jesus. Same as my other

          drive this woman to such an

          Mary coughs. Before she has a chance to catch her breath, a

          She sits down.

          She notices the Little Girl's shoes are soaked. Mary moves
          next to her, takes off her rubber boots and puts them on the
          Little Girl. Mary puts an arm around her, holds her close at
          - softly,
          her side, then speaks like she's a different person
          to herself, the Little Girl unable to read her lips.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I'm not good at... silence. "Mary
          doesn't do quiet", that's how my
          grandmother always said it.
          "What's that hush?" she'd holler at
          a party. "It's Mary about to
          talk", then she'd laugh and laugh
          and laugh. Everybody would... But
          I knew something they didn't - that
          if you keep talking, if you keep on
          talking, you don't hear people
          telling you that you're different.
          You don't hear people saying they
          don't like you. And if you're
          talking, you just might not hear it
          when some kid... calls you a freak.
          Mary's eyes start to well.

</b>          I'm beginning to think newsmen
          can't entirely be trusted.
          She buttons up the Little Girl's sweater.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          The truth is normal is -- not me.
          She seems surprised she said it out loud. There's relief in
          it.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          My friends, the people I've met
          over the past week, they're not
          normal either. They're more
          interesting, more original, more
          real, more rare.
          She suddenly gets it, brightens up.

</b>          That's where I fit.
          - and for
          She thinks about it, in silence. The sadness fades
          the first time, she's comfortably quiet.
          She smiles at the Little Deaf Girl. The Little Deaf Girl
          smiles back. And they sit -- Mary totally calm.
          Mary hears something in the distance - a gentle PLINK PLINK
          PLINK she couldn't have heard while talking.
          She picks up the flashlight, moves toward the noise. In a
          corner of the mine, a water drip hits on some old rusted
          mining tools, including two rusty vice grips.
          The Little Girl coughs. Mary looks back at her, concerned.

          finishing it? Do you know how much
          work goes into making these things?
          Honestly, Dad.
          The Kid grabs a pencil to finish the puzzle.

          Mr. Takihashi watches Mary on TV, wipes his tears.

<b>          EXT. TRI-PARISH FAIR GROUNDS - RESCUE SITE - NIGHT
</b>
          Mary adjusts her eyes to the flashing lights, looks around.
          An Ambulance Attendant tries to attend to her leg. She waves
          him off. In bare feet, blood running down her leg, limping,
          she starts running away from the site toward the media.
          Steve's watches, genuinely happy to see her. Hartman nudges
          Doug to get the camera on Steve.

</b>          First interview is ours. Here
          comes our girl. Steve, you ready?
          Grab her arid kiss her then let me
          start with the questions.
          Doug focuses in on Steve. Hartman holds the crowd back so
          Mary can get to him.
          Mary runs toward them -- and keeps on running, right past
          Steve's open arms.
          She heads for her friends at the fence - Howard, Elizabeth,
          Carlos, George, Lydia, all of the other Protestors. She swan
          dives right into them. They catch her.

</b>          You're okay.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          I am.
          Cameras go off all around them.

          A Greyhound bus travels.

          I've recently discovered, hiding in
          the back of my mind, somewhere
          between astrophysics and a catalog
          of candy bars of the Seventies, a
          previously hidden bit of knowledge
          more important than everything
          else. It is this...

<b>          INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

          Mary sits right at the front talking to the female BUS

<b>          DRIVER.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          In solving the puzzle of life
          there's one thing you must do.
          She points to the side of the road. The bus pulls over.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Find somebody just as normal as
          you.
          Mary stands up, gets off the bus.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          if not a whole bunch.
          Howard, Elizabeth, George, Lydia, Carlos, Clyde, a few old
          Ladies, a bunch of other Protestors file off the bus. Mary
          keeps talking to the bus driver.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          And don't be a slave to your loins.
          Trust me on that one.
          Mary taps the side of her head.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          You need to let this be the boss of
          you. Cornprende ?

<b>          EXT. MARY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - ATLANTA - DAY
</b>
          A huge gated property. Mary opens the gate and walks up a
          tree covered path, Howard right behind her, all the other
          Protestors following. For once, Mary isn't doing all the
          talking.

<b>                         HOWARD
</b>          That bus driver looked like Francis
          Galton. Did you see that?

          They continue on through an open yard.

<b>                         HOWARD
</b>          In retrospect, and I say this with
          some hesitation because I don't
          like to have actual regrets so I'll
          just say I'm beginning to perpend -

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Good one.

<b>                         HOWARD
</b>          I'm beginning to perpend whether or
          not eating three bags of caramel
          corn for lunch was the smartest
          thing to do. Honestly I'm this
          close to spewing...
          Mary reaches the end of the path and stops, waits for
          everybody else to catch up. They're in complete awe of the
          monstrous Georgian estate before them.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          My grandma left it to me. My
          parents won't stay here. And for
          me it was always too... quiet.
          She looks at her new friends.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Not anymore.
          They head toward the house.
