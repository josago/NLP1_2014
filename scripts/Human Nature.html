               Bird's-eye view. We circle lazily above the forest.

               Through a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse 
               of a prostrate form on the ground. As the circling camera 
               gets closer we see that the form is a human body.

               It's a frenetic hand-held shot as Lila is pulled from a police 
               car and dragged into the precinct house. Cameras flash. 
               Reporters shout questions. Lila attempts to shield her face 
               from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch 
               her shoulders.

               A ratty interrogation room. Institutional green walls.

               Beat-up file cabinets. Dark. A bit of fluorescent light spills 
               in through the frosted glass door. Lila, thirties, sits at 
               the end of a long table. A reel-to-reel tape recorder whirs 
               in front of her. She is smoking. Three fat, mean-looking 
               cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table. One of 
               the cops eyes her lasciviously. Lila's hand shakes as she 
               brings the cigarette to her mouth.

                         of my life in jail. So what? I've 
                         been in jail my whole life anyway. A 
                         jail of blood and tissue and coursing 
                         hormones...

               One of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose.

               It's going to be a long night.

               The lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at Lila's reference 
               to "human body."

               business suit, testifies before a congressional committee. 
               The auditorium is filled with reporters and spectators. Puff 
               sits in front of a microphone, counsel at his side. He pours 
               himself a glass of water, drinks, clears his throat, then 
               speaks: stentorian, confident.

                         world.

                         a life of simplicity, of purity, 
                         when I was ripped out of my Eden and 
                         immersed in this harshness. Some 
                         would argue that the life I was living 
                         was not a human life at all. And, 
                         gentlemen, I don't have any clever

                         I knew -- maybe it was all I knew -- 
                         but here sorry is meaningless. Love 
                         is meaningless. Jealousy is 
                         meaningless. Ambition is meaningless. 
                         Everything that motivated my every

               Colors are still muted. It looks to be somewhere in the early 
               70's based on the preponderance of Bay City Rollers posters 
               on the wall. Twelve year old Lila enters the room, closes 
               the door, locks it, rattles the doorknob to make sure that 
               the door is really locked. She draws the shades. She pulls 
               some t-shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into 
               the space between the bottom of the door and the floor.

               Lila stands nervously in front of the full-length mirror on 
               her closet door. She takes a deep breath and begins to 
               unbutton her shirt, watching herself carefully in the mirror.

                         to my body when I was twelve. My 
                         mother said because of it I would

                         knowledge, or religion... or whatever.

               Lila's shirt is now unbuttoned. She pulls it open. She is 
               wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast 
               buds. On the chest above the bra, and on her stomach below 
               it, is hair. Dark curly hair. She stares at it, touches it 
               cautiously. Then she starts to cry. She crouches into a ball 
               and weeps.

               Lila walks home. She's wrapped in winter clothing, but we 
               can still see a bit of her white beard. It's snowing. The 
               street is deserted. She spots a lighted window, she peers 
               in. It's a warm family scene. Large group of chatting, 
               laughing people. Fire in the fireplace. Big turkey on the

               Lila looks down the street and sees dozens of lonely-looking

               ladders to peer in second-floor windows. Lila sighs.

               She is about to slice her wrists.

               On the shelf next to the tub a little gray mouse watches her 
               intently. At first she is startled, but then she and the

                         the back door of a movie theater, 
                         forced casual. It turned the sky a

               Lightning hits a tree nearby. It falls with a smack 
               practically on top of Lila. She screams, then defiantly 
               stands, throwing off the sleeping bag. The wind and rain 
               whip her hair around her head. She laughs with amazing gusto 
               and raise her arms like a runner winning a marathon.

               Adult Nathan sits on the couch, dabbing at his eyes.

               Wendall, his therapist sits across from him and writes 
               something in his notebook.

                         to do with your interest in table 
                         manners in the present.

               Nathan thinks long and hard about this. He seems to be really 
               straining, squinting his eyes. Finally:

               Wendall looks up.

<b>               INT. LAB - DAY

               Everything's white. People in lab coats hustle back and forth. 
               Nathan, also in a lab coat, is hovering over a Lucite 
               encasement. Inside we see two white mice, both attached to 
               electrodes. They sit in little chairs at a little table. In 
               front of each of them is a little plate of salad and three 
               forks of varying size under Lucite domes.

               Nathan nods to his pretty French assistant, Gabrielle, who 
               presses a button. The Lucite domes over the salads lift.

               Tentatively both mice reach for a fork. There is a tiny piece 
               of velcro on each mouse's paw and a tiny piece of velcro on 
               each of the forks. The first mouse picks the correct fork, 
               and stabs it into the salad and eats happily, relieved. The 
               second mouse picks the wrong fork. Nathan presses a button, 
               which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electric 
               shock. The correct mouse keeps eating, unconcerned. Nathan 
               makes a note in his notebook.

               Gabrielle watches Nathan as he writes, enchanted.

               The table is elegantly set, candlelit. Lila sits at it while 
               Nathan fusses in the kitchenette. Something classical wafts 
               over from the stereo in the living room. Nathan places a 
               salad in front of Lila and sits across from her with his own 
               salad.

               Lila picks up a fork from the inside of her setting, not the 
               outside. Nathan blinks. Lila tastes the salad.

                         in as the dinner progresses.

               Nathan pounds his forehead with his fist. Lila waves her

               Apparently there's a piece of food stuck in Lila's teeth.

               and everyone glances sideways over at Lila, waiting for her 
               to make her move. She reaches for the wrong fork, corrects 
               herself and picks the salad fork. Nathan breathes a sigh of 
               relief. His mother looks disappointed, clucks. They eat in 
               silence. Finally:

                         and Mrs. Bronfman. I've heard so 
                         much about you and I've seen you in 
                         photographs from Nathan's childhood, 
                         but it's nice to meet you in the 
                         flesh. I must say, you look exactly 
                         the same as in the photographs.

               His mother and father touch their faces reflexively, then 
               look at each other and laugh.

                         to take off our make-up.

               The mother and father laugh again. Then they pull at their 
               latex faces. The wrinkles come off. And they look exactly as 
               they did in the flashback scene, albeit a bit pink-faced.

               There is another pause.

               The father and Nathan laugh at mother's joke. Lila joins in 
               weakly, against her better judgment.

               Nathan drives. He's dressed in spanking new, freshly starched 
               safari clothes, big shiny new hiking boots. Lila sits in the 
               front passenger seat. She is dressed in a costume identical 
               to Nathan's, but, as opposed to Nathan, she seems awkward in 
               it. She fidgets in it, straightens it, sighs, comes to terms 
               with it, and looks dreamily out the window at the passing 
               trees. She is home. That's all that matters.

               stealthily. Then she sheds her clothes, almost shaking them 
               off, like a dog shaking off some cute costume his owner had 
               dressed him in.

               Lila turns her head and glares at Nathan. There is an animal 
               fierceness in her eye that shuts him up instantly.

               She turns back to pursue her prey.

               Puff's POV: We see a naked Lila looking in our general

                         before. Like me, yet different in 
                         certain essential details. And all 
                         at once I felt a heat pass through 
                         me. My heart raced. Gentlemen, I 
                         wanted to touch her, to caress her, 
                         to be one with her. I had urges and 
                         desires I could not explain. I felt 
                         overwhelmed by the power this strange 
                         creature had over me, and so I did

               We are with Lila. She creeps along, when suddenly a tan, 
               muscular figure tears out from behind a tree and runs, 
               practically on all fours, through the dense underbrush.

               Lila follows, almost as agile as the forest creature.

               Nathan just stands there. The chase continues. There is a 
               great deal of heaving and panting. Puff shimmies up a large 
               tree. Lila follows. Puff leaps from branch to branch.

               Lila follows easily. Puff swings from a vine. So does Lila. 
               Finally they come to the end of the trees, a clearing. There 
               is no nowhere for Puff to leap. Lila is with him in the tree. 
               They are crouched, bloody, heaving, on separate branches, 
               staring at each other. After a long moment, Lila speaks.

</b>                         Who are you?

               Puff cocks his head. The high timbre of her voice surprises 
               him, pleases him, but he doesn't understand the words.

<b>                                     LILA

                         you?

               Puff looks at his crotch. Apparently there is some activity 
               down there. Lila, following his eyes, glances down there 
               also.

                         I take it back, you do understand my 
                         language.

               Puff grabs for his crotch and begins to play with himself 
               distractedly, looking at her all the while. He falls out of 
               the tree. Lila gasps. Branches crack and snap as he passes 
               through them and then there is an unpleasant thud when he 
               hits the forest floor. Lila shimmies down the tree, and kneels 
               by Puff. He is unconscious.

               Nathan comes limping through the brush. Somehow his safari 
               suit and boots are as clean and pressed as they were in the 
               car. He is carrying Lila's clothes. Somehow he has had time 
               to neatly fold them.

               Nathan hovers over the Lucite case with the tiny dinner table 
               in it. His assistant, Gabrielle, presses a button, a door 
               opens, and two white mice scurry in. The male pulls out a 
               chair for the female. The female climbs up on the chair, and 
               the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the 
               other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair. The 
               Lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both 
               mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating. Nathan 
               scribbles in his notebook.

               Nathan looks up. Gabrielle jerks her head in the direction 
               of a very large Lucite case. Inside, Puff, now dressed in a 
               diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring. 
               Nathan and Gabrielle hurry over.

               Puff groggily takes in his surroundings. This is quite a lot 
               to take in. The white room, the strange apes in strange suits, 
               his own clothing, the wires. After surveying the scene for a 
               moment, Puff becomes frightened and agitated.

               He tries to escape. Not understanding Lucite, he smashes 
               into it, again and again. He tears at his diaper. Nathan 
               gives a nod to Gabrielle, who presses a button on a panel.

               An electric shock sends Puff flying. He lies on the floor 
               confused and dazed. After a moment, he gets up and again 
               crashes into the Lucite. Nathan gives the signal to Gabrielle 
               and once again she shocks Puff. He once again gets up and 
               crashes against the Lucite. Again he is shocked. He gets up 
               again, and is about to crash against the Lucite, but he thinks 
               better of it, and squats in place, immobilized.

                         had to go through. The courage she's 
                         had to have in the face of this

               Gabrielle kneels by Puff's case. Puff crawls over, tries to 
               touch her through the Lucite. Gabrielle sings a French

               Puff, in his Lucite case, sits behind a set dinner table.

               He seems attentive, calm, interested as Nathan teaches him 
               table manners. Gabrielle stands very close, almost 
               possessively close, to Nathan. She wears a lab coat, but it 
               is unbuttoned, and underneath she is wearing a skin-tight 
               black minidress. She strokes the back of Nathan's head as he 
               works with Puff.

               Gabrielle tears off her lab coat. Underneath she is wearing 
               practically nothing, a skimpy black dress. She throws the

               Nathan stares contemplatively out the window and sips his 
               drink. Lila watches him, comes up behind him, puts her arms 
               around him. Nathan cringes, but tries to cover it. Lila feels 
               the cringe, but pretends not to have. She keeps her arms 
               around him for a moment longer, then casually removes them.

               opera box. There is a mannequin woman sitting next to him 
               and a boom box pumping out Beethoven's Fidelio. Puff seems 
               attentive, refined, occasionally bringing a pair of opera

               1) Nathan demonstrates the proper way to taste wine: sniffing 
               the cork, swishing the wine around in the glass, sipping, 
               nodding in the affirmative to the waiter. Puff, inside his 
               case, imitates it perfectly.

               2) Nathan shows Puff a flashcard which reads: "I'll start 
               tonight with the foie gras."

               3) Puff is holding up a small hand mirror and trimming nose 
               hairs. Lila applauds.

               4) Puff juggles three balls while riding a unicycle.

               5) Puff, dressed as Peter Pan, stands with legs spread and 
               hands on hips. He is singing "I Gotta Crow."

               6) Puff, dressed in an apron and chef's hat, is tossing a 
               salad. There are two types of vinegar to choose from. He 
               hesitates, then chooses the balsamic. Nathan and Lila applaud.

               7) Puff, in a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe, is sitting 
               in an easy chair, next to a fake fire and a fake sleeping 
               dog, and reading a book of poems by Yeats. Lila and Nathan, 
               outside the case, applaud and embrace.

                         electronic collar. I don't think 
                         we'll need to shock you, but just in 
                         case.

</b>                         Okay. That's fair.

               Nathan unlocks the case. Puff tentatively steps out into the 
               world. He hugs Nathan. It's a grateful, obsequious, slightly 
               pathetic hug. Nathan hugs him back, but he's keeping him at 
               a distance. Puff pulls himself out of the hug, but still 
               rests his hands on Nathan's shoulders and looks him in the 
               eye, almost like a lover. Then he parts with Nathan and goes 
               over to embrace Lila. She graciously receives him. After a 
               moment in the embrace, Puff starts dry-humping Lila. Lila 
               can't get out of his clutches.

               Nathan presses a button, which shocks Puff and sends him 
               flying. Puff appears disoriented, then gets up off the floor, 
               brushes himself off, and turns to Lila with a bow of his 
               head.

               Lila dims the lights and switches on the projector. An image 
               of a pretty, fully clothed woman appears on the screen. Puff's 
               eyes widen, but he remains seated.

               The slide changes to a naked woman standing in a neutral 
               position, no expression on her face. Puff twitches, but stays 
               seated.

               The slide changes to another photo of the same woman in the 
               same position, but with a seductive smile on her face. Puff 
               clutches the arms of the chairs.

               her butt out, and looking over her shoulder at the viewer 
               with shiny, heavily lipsticked, pursed lips. Puff is shaking.

               Puff leaps out of his chair screaming and lunges for the 
               screen. Nathan grabs the black box and jolts him. Puff goes 
               flying in the air and lands with a crack. He heaves for a 
               while, then leaps up and runs for the screen again.

               Again Nathan shocks him. Again he lands on the floor. He 
               heaves, stands, lunges for the screen again. Nathan shocks 
               him. This happens seven more times. Smoke is pouring out 
               from the collar. Puff struggles to his feet. Looks at the 
               screen. He shrugs.

               It has been transformed into a bachelor pad. Inside is a

               Lila and Puff are driving in silence on a dirt road through

               the car will be camouflaged, and parks.

               looks confused at first. Then the male mouse pushes the door 
               open and holds it for the female mouse, who exits. The male 
               mouse follows her, and closes the door behind him. He turns 
               to Lila, nods, then extends his arm for the female mouse to

               for her face. But whereas Puff is now white and soft-looking, 
               Lila is tan and taut and muscular. This is a reversal of the 
               way both of them were when they first met.

               Nathan is driving along a wooded dirt road. He's in his 
               immaculate safari suit. He looks tired. He stops the car, 
               pulls out a gun, and gets out.

               He looks around there is no one there. He sighs and walks 
               back to his car, pulls out a map and marks an area with a 
               red X.

               Lila and puff are having sex again next to a campfire. Now 
               Lila is wearing the collar, and Puff is giving her well timed 
               shocks. They giggle and kiss after they finish. Puff sits 
               up. He holds his stomach and grunts hungrily. Lila grunts 
               back. She stands and retrieves a sack of berries.

               Puff and Lila greedily, gluttonously stuff their faces.

               Lila takes some berries and smashes them against Puff's face. 
               She laughs heartily. He looks annoyed for a second, but then 
               grabs a handful and squishes them against Lila's face. Pretty 
               soon they are having a berry war and are covered in purple 
               stains. They hug each other, out of breath and laughing.

               Lila and Puff lie naked in a tree, lazily soaking up the 
               midday sun. There is a rustling in the bushes. They both 
               look up, alert but calm. Nathan, immaculate in his safari 
               suit, appears in the clearing. He holds a gun.

                         primordial ooze and brought you into 
                         the world of culture and art and

               Puff looks at Lila. Lila shrugs helplessly. Puff reaches out 
               to touch her hand.

               Puff looks at Lila again. She jerks her head in the direction 
               of Nathan. Puff sighs and moves to Nathan.

               Nathan prods Puff, and they head off through the trees.

               Suddenly Puff elbows Nathan. Nathan grunts, doubles over.

               Puff turns, lunges, and the two wrestle on the ground.

               Puff pries the gun from Nathan's hand, and jumps up. Nathan 
               stands also, backing away. Puff has the gun trained on Nathan. 
               Lila runs to Puff, stands behind him.

                         You did create me in your image, 
                         Nathan. Before you I was a simple, 
                         happy, complete being, in harmony 
                         with the world around me. After you 
                         I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, 
                         anal, totally out of touch with my 
                         surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I 
                         became you. Lila has reintroduced me 
                         to myself. And, incidentally, what 
                         I'm about to do, kill you, is 
                         something that would never have 
                         occurred to me to do as a creature 
                         of the Earth. Before when I killed, 
                         it was for food or in self-defense. 
                         Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge 
                         is an abstract concept, Nathan. And 
                         I learned abstract thinking from 
                         you.

                         much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe 
                         more so, because I knew it was wrong 
                         and I went along with it anyway. I'm 
                         taking responsibility for the murder. 
                         I want you to go back to your old 
                         life.

                         bastard. And I'm glad.

                         sacrifice I need to make. In my world 
                         we have something called penance. 
                         It's another abstraction, but I had 
                         the concept drummed into my head 
                         during my years in the convent. It 
                         doesn't exist for you, and it 
                         shouldn't. See, I could never be 
                         free again anyway, so I might as 
                         well be in jail.

</b>                         And so, gentlemen, that is my story. 
                         I agreed to testify before this 
                         committee because I hoped to convey 
                         to the American public that there is 
                         indeed a paradise lost. Human beings 
                         have become so enamored of their 
                         technologies and their intellectual 
                         prowess and their fancy gourmet foods, 
                         that they've forgotten to look to 
                         the Earth as a teacher. This is 
                         hubris, my friends. And my story of 
                         destruction and betrayal is proof of 
                         that. I will keep my promise to Lila. 
                         I will shed this suit and go back 
                         into the wilderness. I will live out 
                         my days naked and free.

               Puff stands and exits the auditorium. Flashbulbs flash.

               In the prison common room, Lila wipes a tear from her eye.

               She seems genuinely happy. She looks out a small barred window 
               and sees a bluebird light there, then fly away.
