</b><b>1	  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1
</b>	   This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
	   haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
	   the CAMERA with urgency:
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Why would you say that I am
			   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've
			   lost my mind simply because I've
			   heard the voices and seen the
			   godless things moving in the
			   woods. If anything, I think more
			   clearly now than ever before. I
			   know now that there is such a
			   thing as a living Evil. A dark
			   and shapeless thing that lives
			   not in the spaces we know, but
			   between them. In the Dark. In the
			   night. And it wants the exact same
			   thing as you and I: a chance at
			   warm life on this Earth. It
			   doesn't care that is already had
			   that chance ...once. Now listen
			   closely because there isn't much
			   time. Listen and believe, because
			   it's all true.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>2	  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2
</b>	   nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
	   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   I first saw the damn thing at that
			   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
			   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
			   in human flesh and inked in human
			   blood. It contained bizarre burial
			   rites, prophesies...and
			   instruction for demon
			   resurrection. It was never meant
			   for the world of the living.

<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>3	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 3
</b>	   Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   The book awoke something dark in
			   the woods.
<b>									   SUPERIMPOSE:
</b><b>4	  BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT			 4
</b>	   inscribed on the pages.  Illustrations of demonic faces with
	   white eyes.
<b>5	  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT									 5
</b>	   We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
	   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the
	   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   It got into my hand and it went
			   bad.
<b>6	  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6
</b>	   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   So I lopped it off at the wrist.
<b>7	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7
</b>	   ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
<b>8	  BLOOD RED CLOUDS									   8
</b>	   sweep past the moon.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   In order to rid myself of the foul
			   thing, I read from a passage in
			   the book that was supposed to open
			   a hole.  A hole in Time that would
			   send the Evil back. And it worked.
<b>9	  A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH							   9
</b>	   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
<b>10	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 10
</b>	   The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
	   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   ...I just didn't plan on coming
			   along.
<b>11	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 11
</b>	   Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
	   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
<b>12	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   12
</b>	   Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is
	   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
	   Time.
<b>13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE						    13
</b>	   swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
	   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke
	   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
	   words:
<b>					   "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
</b>					   "Vs"
	   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
<b>					   "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
</b>	   The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
<b>14	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   14
</b><b>	   A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
</b>	   its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
	   past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
	   funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
<b>15	 ASH												 15
</b>	   He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
	   BEATING of his heart.
<b>16	 ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION					   16
</b>	   He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel
	   cloud electrifies.
<b>17	 ASH'S BODY										    17
</b>	   RIPS at the fabric of Time.
<b>18	 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY								   18
</b>	   All is quiet.  Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
	   a human body flashes briefly and is gone.  A moment latter, Ash
	   appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
<b>19	 EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY							  19
</b>	   ASH falls to the dust.  His double barrelled shotgun lands
	   beside him.  The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
	   a moment later.
<b>20	 ASH												 20
</b>	   looks up from the dust to behold...
<b>21	 TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN							 21
</b>	   in 12th century armor ride up over a hill.  They halt before
	   Ash.
<b>22	 WARRIOR #1										    22
</b>	   thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:
<b>					   WARRIOR #1
</b>			   Hail to him who has come from the
			   sky to deliver us from the terror
			   of the Deadites!  Hail!
<b>23	 ASH												 23
</b>	   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
<b>24	 TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR									24
</b>	   join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
<b>25	 ARTHUR											   25
</b>	   the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into
	   frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur
	   lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
<b>26	 ARTHUR'S P.O.V.									    26
</b>	   The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.
	   The handless stump of Ash's right arm.  The Shotgun.
<b>27	 A FRIGHTENED ASH									   27
</b>	   waves a shaky hand.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Take is easy now chief. I don't
			   know how I got here and I'm not
			   lookin' for any trouble.
<b>28	 WISEMAN JOHN										  28
</b>	   An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.
<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   My Lord Arthur, I believe he is
			   the promised one, written of in
			   the Necronomicon.
<b>29	 ARTHUR											   29
</b>	   Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
	   as...
<b>30	 ASH'S CHEST										   30
</b>	   is cut. A thin red gash.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The
			   one written of in the Book would
			   not bleed.
<b>31	 ARTHUR GESTURES									    31
</b>	   and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Likely, he is one of Henry's men.
			   I say to the pit with him!  If he
			   is truly the promised one... he
			   will emerge.
<b>					   WARRIOR #2 AND #3
</b>			   Aye!  The pit's a fair test!
<b>					   GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR
</b>			   To the pit with the blackard!
<b>32	 GOLD TOOTH										    32
</b>	   charges his horse at Ash. But he is met with the wooden stock
	   of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his
	   jaw.
<b>33	 WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN						 33
</b>	   He tumbles from the horse.
<b>34	 ASH												 34
</b>	   leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.
<b>35	 LONG SHOT - ASH'S HORSE								 35
</b>	   rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.
<b>36	 ASH												 36
</b>	   gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face
	   as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling.
<b>37	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH									37
</b>	   galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but
	   manages to hang on for dear life.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Where the hell they put the
			   stirrups on this thing!!??
<b>38	 CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET								 38
</b>	   grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.
<b>39	 LONG SHOT - ASH - STUNTMAN							   39
</b>	   he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.
<b>40	 ANGLE ON ARTHUR									    40
</b><b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   LIEUTENANTS!  Fetch me the blackard.
<b>41	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S ARMORED HORSEMEN						  41
</b>	   unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining
	   Warriors watch for sport.
<b>42	 HIGH SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN								42
</b>	   They are gaining an Ash.
<b>43	 ASH												 43
</b>	   glances behind him.
<b>44	 ASH'S P.O.V. - TRUCKING SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN IN PURSUIT		44
</b>	   They diverge to either side of CAMERA.
<b>45	 ASH												 45
</b>	   whips his horse.
<b>					   ASH
</b><b>			   GIDDYPU!
</b><b>46	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 46
</b>	   rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.
<b>	   WHOOSH!!!
</b><b>47	 ASH												 47
</b>	   ducks the blade.
<b>48	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									48
</b>	   rides up alongside Ash's other flank.  He swings and lands the
	   flat part of his blade along Ash's back.
<b>	   THUNK!
</b><b>49	 ASH												 49
</b>	   ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.
<b>	   WHOOSH!
</b>	   ASH looks left...
<b>50	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									50
</b>	   winds up for another blow.
<b>51	 ASH												 51
</b>	   yanks back upon his horse's reigns.
<b>52	 THE THREE HORSES									   52
</b>	   running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.
<b>53	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									53
</b>	   swings.
<b>54	 HIS BROADSWORD										54
</b>	   slams the First Horseman across the face.
<b>55	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 55
</b>	   is knocked from his steed.
<b>56	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE FIRST HORSEMAN						56
</b>	   is moving fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles
	   end over end in the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.
<b>57	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									57
</b>	   turns around and gallops back toward Ash.
<b>58	 WIDE SHOT - ASH AND THE SECOND HORSEMAN					58
</b>	   ride at one another.
<b>59	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND SWORDMAN AS HE RIDES			  59
</b>	   swinging his Broadsword.
<b>60	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH AS HE RIDES						   60
</b>	   He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of
	   his chainsaw arm bracket.
	   FOOMP!  He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into
	   place.  CLINK!
	   He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter
	   cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses
	   and yanks again.
<b>61	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									61
</b>	   draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword
	   mightily.  The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!
<b>62	 ASH												 62
</b>	   is knocked from his steed.  He tumbles to the dust, narrowly
	   escaping his own horse's hooves.
<b>63	 ASH												 63
</b>	   rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!
<b>64	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									64
</b>	   charges and swings his broadsword.
<b>65	 ASH												 65
</b>	   raises his chainsaw.  CLINK!  He deflects the blow. Ash swings

	   the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second
	   Horseman as he rides past.
<b>66	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					    66
</b>	   is knocked from his horse.
<b>67	 LOW TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					67
</b>	   bounces along the rocky ground, kicking up dust.
<b>68	 A SWORD HANDLE										68
</b>	   slams against the back of Ash's skull.
<b>69	 ASH												 69
</b>	   crumples.  He looks up in pain to...
<b>70	 ARTHUR											   70
</b>	   above him. The sun over his shoulder.
<b>71	 EIGHT MOUNTED WARRIORS								  71
</b>	   gallop up, dismount and surround Ash with swords drawn.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Bring the prisoner!
	   The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw
	   are taken from him.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   No!
<b>72	 GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							72
</b>	   secure Ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his
	   arms. A collar forces his neck upward.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   To the castle!
<b>73	 WARRIOR #2 ON HORSEBACK								 73
</b>	   prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.
	   The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners
	   to run alongside them.
<b>74	 WISEMAN JOHN										  74
</b>	   Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.  He
	   is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the
	   blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>75	 THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN								  75
</b>	   blazing in the sky above the wasteland.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>76	 EXT. PARCHED LAND - DAY - A WEARY ASH					  76
</b>	   bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides
	   alongside him.
<b>					   GOLD TOOTH
</b>			   Move along now!
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>77	 LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK			 77
</b>	   CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find
	   a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff.
	   A drawbridge is lowered.  Arthur's warriors ride over it.

<b>78	 CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH								78
</b>	   shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle
	   walls.
<b>79	 INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   79
</b><b>	   SHEILA
</b>	   a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She
	   searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned.
	   She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur
	   atop his horse.
<b>					   SHEILA
</b>			   M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother?
			   Did he not ride with you?
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Eye.  And fought valiantly.  But
			   last night fell in battle to Duke
			   Henry's men.
<b>	   SHEILA
</b>	   Her face does not immediately register the grief.  She attempts
	   to step forward but stumbles.  She steadies herself against the
	   stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
	   shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
	   She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
	   at him as he's dragged along.
<b>					   SHEILA
</b>			   Foul thing!  A pox on your throat!
			   Thou art a Murderer!  A black
			   Murderer!
<b>80	 VILLAGE WOMEN										 80
</b>	   restrain her.
<b>	   SHEILA
</b>	   cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her.
<b>					   VILLAGE WOMAN #1
</b>			   May you be consoled by their
			   suffering in the pit.
<b>81	 THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS			 81
</b>	   halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the
	   prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at
	   swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the
	   ground. This is THE PIT.
<b>82	 ASH												 82
</b>	   looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering
	   what they have in store for him.
<b>83	 SHEILA											   83
</b>	   stares at him in hatred.
<b>84	 THE PRISONER NEXT TO ASH								84
</b>	   eyes Ash curiously.  This is Duke Henry the Red.
<b>					   DUKE HENRY
</b>			   You sir, are not one of my
			   vassals.  Who are you?
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Who wants to know?
<b>					   DUKE HENRY
</b>			   I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.
			   Lord of the Northlands and leader
			   of its people.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   You ain't leadin' but two things
			   now, pal. Jack and shit.  And Jack
			   left town.
<b>85	 A STERN FACED ARTHUR AND HIS FOUR LIEUTENANTS			    85
</b>	   address the doomed men:
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   There is an Evil that has awakened
			   in this land.  And whilst my
			   people fight for their very souls
			   against it, you, Duke Henry the
			   Red, wage war on us. Your people
			   are no better than the foul
			   corruption that lies in the bowels
			   of that pit!  May God have mercy
			   on your souls.
<b>86	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S MEN									86
</b>	   crank a massive wench.  Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid
	   slides back, revealing a dark hole.  The Pit.
<b>87	 FROM THE BOWELS OF THE IRON GRATED PIT					 87
</b>	   a echoed wailing rises up.
<b>88	 ASH, HENRY AND THE OTHER PRISONERS						88
</b>	   stiffen in fear.
<b>89	 AN OLD WOMAN AMONGST THE JEERING CROWD					 89
</b><b>					   OLD WOMAN
</b>			   Aye. Into the pit with the
			   bloodthirsty sons of whores!
	   She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
<b>	   CAMERA PANS TO...
</b><b>90	 HENRY'S WARRIOR #1									 90
</b>	   as he's thrown down into the pit.  He disappears into the
	   blackness.
<b>91	 CAMERA PANS AND HALTS CLOSE ON ASH						91
</b>	   watching with disbelief.  We hear the warrior's echoed cry of
	   terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom.
<b>92	 CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT							 92
</b>	   looking down into the blackness we hear:
<b>					   HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 (O.S.)
</b>			   I beg of you... by all that's
			   holy!  Lower a rope!  Lower... Oh,
			   for the love of god!  no!  NO!!!
			   AIIIIIiiieee!
	   The sound of ripping and scratching.  The SHRIEK of terror is
	   cut short as...
<b>	   A GEYSER OF BLOOD
</b>	   erupts upward from the pit. Then silence.
<b>93	 ASH												 93
</b>	   is frozen in fear.
<b>					   TOWER GUARD (O.S.)
</b>			   There!  He's escaping!
<b>	   ASH'S TERRIFIED GAZE
</b>	   jerks from the pit to...
<b>94	 TRACKING SHOT - HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						94
</b>	   making a break for it!  He's past the guards, heading for the open
	   drawbridge.
<b>95	 THE TOWER ARCHERS									  95
</b>	   spot him and fire arrows.
<b>96	 ANGLE ON											 96
</b><b>	   PING!  PING!
</b>	   They bounce off the Warrior's armor.  He's makes it to the open
	   drawbridge when...
<b>97	 ARTHUR											   97
</b>	   pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow.  ZING!  He lets it fly.
	   CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow...
<b>98	 PAN HALTS ON HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						   98
</b>	   The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to
	   a wooden post.  He dies standing.
<b>99	 THE CROWD											99
</b>	   Cheers.  They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners:
	   CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner
	   in line...
<b>100	ASH												 100
</b>	   turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Hey, I never even saw these
			   assholes before..
	   He spins to Duke Henry the Red.
			   You gotta tell 'em you don't know
			   me. We never met. Tell him.
<b>					   HENRY
</b>			   I do not believe that he shall
			   listen.
<b>101	THE WARRIORS										  101
</b>	   grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
<b>102	ASH												 102
</b>	   tumbles down into the pit.  He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul
	   water at the pit's bottom.  He stands and coughs out a mouthful

	   of the rancid water. He looks about.
<b>103	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 103
</b>	   UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.
<b>104	ASH												 104
</b>	   spins to a small sound.
<b>105	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 105
</b>	   Nothing.  Just the mist rising from the water.
<b>106	ASH												 106
</b>	   shifts his glance again.
<b>107	A SHADOW											 107
</b>	   rounds a corner and disappears from sight.
<b>108	ASH												 108
</b>	   doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir.
	   Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes
	   break the surface.
<b>109	ASH												 109
</b>	   spins... but there's nothing there.  As he turns back around,
	   he is confronted by...
<b>	   A FEMALE EVIL DEAD
</b>	   It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's
	   face!
<b>110	CLOSER											   110
</b>	   Putrid water drains from it's empty eye sockets and mouth. It
	   jerks like a marionette as it advances.
<b>111	ASH SCREAM										    111
</b>	   and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit.  He tries to
	   scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.
<b>112	THE DEADITE'S HAND									 112
</b>	   clutches Ash's ankle and yanks him back down.
<b>113	DOWN ANGLE ON ASH									  113
</b>	   He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing.
<b>114	ABOVE THE PIT - GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER VILLAGERS			   114
</b>	   hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured.
<b>115	THE PIT - THE DEADITE								   115
</b>	   grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists.
<b>116	ABOVE THE PIT - SHEILA								  116
</b>	   shouts for Ash's death.
<b>117	THE PIT - ASH'S FACE								    117
</b>	   The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash.
<b>118	LONG SHOT - ASH									    118
</b>	   is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.
<b>119	THE DEADITE										   119
</b>	   races toward Ash, leaps into the air and comes down with a
	   kneedrop onto Ash's stomach.
<b>120	ASH												 120
</b>	   cries out in pain.
<b>121	ASH'S LEGS										    121
</b>	   cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat.  He
	   flips the beast.
<b>122	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 122
</b>	   rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd
	   with a bundle wrapped in cloth.
<b>123	THE DEADITE										   123
</b>	   grabs Ash by the throat.
<b>124	THE PIT - A BLOODIED ASH								124
</b>	   is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.
<b>125	THE DEADITE										   125
</b>	   advances.
<b>126	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 126
</b>	   shouts down at Ash.
<b>127	THE PIT - ASH										 127
</b>	   trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts
	   backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints
	   to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an

<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN
</b>			   Only the Necronomicon has the

	   Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by

</b>	   All is quiet.  Ash hugs the door. Shaking in the silence.  And
	   that's when it hits.  LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE!
	   Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of
	   the Shed as the Evil Force brings it's tremendous power to bare.
<b>259	INT. SHED - SAM-O-CAM - INTERVOLOMETER					 259
</b><b>	   TRACKING WITH ASH AND THE DOOR
</b>	   as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil
	   Force.  Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the
	   Shed, spinning head over heels.  Ash rips through other doors,
	   taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors
	   as he flies through the air.
<b>260	EXT. SHED - SIDE SHOT								   260
</b>	   The roof of the shed ripples, sending tiles and wood beams
	   flying as the EVIL FORCE surges through the shed like a tidal
	   wave.
<b>261	EXT. REAR DOOR OF SHED								  261
</b>	   It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the
	   other doors.  The flying doors slam against a tree and fall to
	   the ground in a stack.
<b>262	THE EVIL FORCE										262
</b>	   with Ash out of sight, glides forward, into the woods.
<b>263	EXT. SHED- DUSK									    263

	   turns slightly.  The door swings upward and opens... revealing
	   a somewhat flattened Ash who picks his groggy and bruised self
	   up.

	   He beholds...
<b>264	EXT. ABANDONED MILL									264
</b>	   An empty place of stone and wood.  Driven by the wind, the

<b>265	INT. MILL											265
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   enters the Mill.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Anybody here?!
	   The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his
	   breath.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   This place'll do for the night.
			   Get the book in the morning.
<b>266	INT. MILL - THREE SHOTS - INTERVOLOMETER				    266

<b>268	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT THE SUN - DAY					    268
</b>	   a gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the Mill.  The wind

<b>269	INT. MILL											269
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force
	   of the gale.
<b>270	THE WOODEN SHUTTERS									270

	   warmth.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Damn this cold.
<b>271	ASH												 271
</b>	   looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove.
<b>272	GASOLINE											 272
</b>	   pours out of Ash's chainsaw over some logs in the stove's belly.
<b>273	ASH												 273
</b>	   lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   'least I won't freeze to death.
	   He turns to a tiny sound.
<b>274	WIDE SHOT - ASH									    274
</b>	   behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps
	   past.

<b>275	ASH												 275
</b>	   spins, raises his shotgun and fires.
<b>	   BLAMITY-BLAM!
</b>	   The window is ripped away in a shower of glass.
<b>276	ASH'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW				    276
</b>	   Only the night woods.  The "gnarled hand" comes back, sweeping
	   down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just
	   a tree branch swaying in the wind.
<b>277	ASH												 277
</b>	   reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a
	   crack.
<b>278	ASH'S EYEBALL										 278
</b>	   through the crack in the door.
<b>279	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE WOODS BEYOND						   279

</b>	   The tiny figure of Ash steps from the Mill.
<b>281	CLOSE UP - ASH										281
</b>	   He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks
	   breaking.
<b>282	ASH'S TERRIFIED HORSE								   282
</b>	   It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward
	   Ash.
<b>283	A STARTLED ASH										283
</b>	   leaps aside just in time.
<b>284	ASH												 284
</b>	   snags the horse's reigns.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Easy, boy.
	   The horse calms.  Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A
	   shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.
<b>285	ASH'S P.O.V.  THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR				  285
</b>	   He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.
<b>286	EXT. MILL											286
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the
	   Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill.
<b>287	INT. MILL											287
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's
	   reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks
	   himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the
	   fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....
<b>288	THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES							  288
</b>	   Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash.  From the eight
	   pieces of mirror spring...
<b>289	EIGHT TINY ASHES									   289
</b>	   Two inch high versions of himself.  They leap from the mirror
	   fragments and land on the floor.
<b>290	ASH												 290
</b>	   is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire.
<b>291	TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3								 291
</b>	   grab a discarded dinner fork.  Like men on a battering ram, they
	   race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.
<b>292	ASH												 292
</b>	   SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the
	   stove pipe.
<b>293	TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6								 293
</b>	   lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.  Another
	   leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!
<b>294	ASH												 294
</b>	   barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head
	   off.
<b>295	THE TINY ASHES										295
</b>	   SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.  They jump away from the
	   shotgun and scurry off across the floor.
<b>296	ASH												 296
</b>	   pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it.
<b>297	TINY ASH #1										   297
</b>	   is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry
	   him.
<b>298	TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK								298
</b>	   a giant projectile as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it
	   WHOOSHES past.
<b>	   FA-THONG!
</b><b>299	THE FORK											 299
</b>	   skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.
<b>300	ASH												 300
</b>	   stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front
	   of him by other tiny ASHES.  His head slams into a stove pipe.
	   He crumples.  He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot
	   stove.  SSSSSSssss.  He pries his face loose with a spatula.
<b>301	A BUCKET OF GREASE									 301
</b>	   is pushed off a high shelf.
<b>	   CLANG!
</b><b>302	IT LANDS ON ASH'S HEAD								  302
</b>	   and spills slippery grease about the floor.
<b>303	ASH												 303
</b>	   with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back
	   and forth on the grease.  He stands and tries to dislodge the
	   bucket.  He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his
	   path.  He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting
	   needles jutting from it.
<b>304	BUCKET-HEADED ASH									  304
</b>	   SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the
	   stove pipe.  CLANG!  Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks
	   the needles from his buttocks.  He looks about for the little
	   imps.
<b>305	TINY ASH #2										   305
</b>	   crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT...
<b>306	ASH												 306
</b>	   has seen him.  He "accidentally" elbows the log and Tiny Ash
	   #2 into the stove's fire.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Ooops.
<b>307	TINY ASH #2										   307
</b>	   is burned alive.
<b>308	ASH												 308
</b>	   glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet.
<b>309	TINY ASH #3										   309
</b>	   is dashing across the open expanse of floor.  Ash's gigantic
	   foot comes down to crush the little man.  Tiny Ash #3 raises
	   a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.
<b>	   RIP!!
</b><b>310	THE NAIL RIPS										 310
</b>	   through Ash's shoe.
<b>311	ASH												 311
</b>	   jerks his leg upward in pain.  Ash dances about the place
	   hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area
	   of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in
	   his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost
	   regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls,
	   and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
<b>312	ASH												 312
</b>	   awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with
	   tiny ropes.  Directly above him, on the edge of a table...
<b>313	TINY ASHES #4 AND #5								    313
</b>	   suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs.
<b>314	TINY ASH #7 AND #8									 314
</b>	   stand atop Ash's face.  They push from either side of his
	   nostrils, plugging his nose.  Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for
	   air.  As he inhales...
<b>315	SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6								   315
</b>	   is released.
<b>316	TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN					   316
</b>	   He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form
	   a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
<b>317	ASH												 317
</b>	   inhales the living beast whole.  He chokes violently.  He breaks
	   his bonds an he hacks for breath.  He puts his finger down his
	   throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no
	   avail.
	   He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are
	   gone.  He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles
	   to a chair.  He goes pale.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Nasty little thing's inside me.
	   He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.
			   Well let's see how you like a
			   little hot water!
	   He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding
	   contents painfully down his throat.  He sets down the kettle
	   and waits for a moment.  A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
<b>	   ASH
</b>	   emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.  Then his
	   arm.  He rips back his shirt sleeve.
<b>318	CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION				  318
</b>	   We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down
	   Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.
<b>319	ASH												 319
</b>	   watches in horror as...
<b>320	THE TINY FIGURE									    320
</b>	   squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand.  The
	   Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed
	   iron hand swings at him.
<b>321	THE IRON HAND										 321
</b>	   connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame.
<b>322	ASH												 322
</b>	   lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.  But
	   the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head.
	   Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into
	   the opened vice.
<b>323	THE EVIL IRON HAND									 323
</b>	   cranks the vice's handle.
<b>324	THE VICE											 324
</b>	   tightens around Ash's head.  Trapped, he looks to...
<b>325	THE EVIL HAND										 325
</b>	   rummaging through a wooden toolbox.  It comes upon a crude wooden
	   punch.
<b>326	ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED					   326
</b>	   stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand.  But Ash expertly dodges each
	   stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb
	   is super fast motion.
<b>327	ASH												 327
</b>	   with is head still wedged in the vice.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!
<b>328	A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS								   328
</b>	   has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose.  He emits
	   a nasal SCREAM and shakes the pliers loose.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Soon as I get out of this thing
<b>			   I... YIEEEE!!
</b><b>	   THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS
</b>	   dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   No!  Not the teeth!
<b>	   YANK!
</b><b>329	THE EVIL HAND										 329
</b>	   jerks his rear MOLAR from his head and holds up the tooth for
	   his inspection.  It sets the tooth down nearly in front of him.
	   The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust.  It
	   scurries from view.
<b>330	ASH'S HEAD										    330
</b>	   struggling in the grip of the vice.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Where the hell are ya!?
<b>331	THE EVIL HAND										 331
</b>	   grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   I can't see ya!!
<b>	   HIS EVIL HAND
</b>	   raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the
	   right half of his body.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   No, no--not the poke--
	   SSSSsssssssss!
<b>332	ASH												 332
</b>	   jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM.  He holds up
	   his iron hand.  It's back to normal.  Again under his control.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Okay then.
	   But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His
	   shoulder itches.  He scratches it.  The Itch grows.  It itches
	   madly.  He rips back his shirt.  Upon his shoulder... THERE
<b>	   BLINKS A THIRD EYEBALL!!!
</b><b>333	THE CAMERA RACES INTO THIS HIDEOUS SIGHT				    333
</b>	   It is the eyeball of EVIL ASH.  Beneath it, a mouth and nose
	   begin to take shape on the surface of Ash's back.
<b>334	ASH												 334
</b>	   SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.  The CAMERA
	   follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark
	   woods.
<b>335	EXT. WOODS - 12MM LENSE - NIGHT						   335
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the

	   brambles.  He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this
	   protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Dear God, it's growing bigger!
<b>336	THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER.					336
</b>	   It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from
	   his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil
	   incarnate.
	   He is now a man with two heads!
<b>337	TWO HEADED ASH										337
</b>	   Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical
	   heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.
<b>338	THE BAD ASH HEAD									   338
</b>	   opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.
<b>339	THE GOOD ASH HEAD									  339
</b>	   retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.
<b>340	TWO HEADED ASH										340
</b>	   collapses against a tree.  Under the light of the full moon we
	   see a terrifying sight:
<b>341	TWO ADDITIONAL ARMS									341
</b>	   sprout from Ash's body!
<b>342	A LEG											    342
</b>	   rips out of his stomach.  Another foot POPS out from his back.
<b>343	TWO HEADED ASH										343
</b>	   Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor,
	   propelled by his four arms and four legs.  Suddenly he stands
	   and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first.
	   He literally splits into two.
<b>344	SPLIT SCREEN - WIDE SHOT								344
</b>	   When it's over, there are two ASHES.
	   GOOD ASH and...

<b>347	EVIL ASH											 347
</b>	   Dances a funny jig around Ash.  He SMACKS Ash across the face
	   as he sings:
<b>					   EVIL ASH

</b>			   ...shoes, little goody two-

<b>358	ASH												 358

	   Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of

	   Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet
	   as he digs a grave.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Now you see what's what.  Man's
			   body is his own personal property.
			   Don't anybody try to take that

			   Rest in pieces.
<b>366	ASH												 366

<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Only two things come from Perth:
			   steers and queers. Which are you?
<b>490	EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY									490
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   takes charcoal from a dead fire and chips of dried cow dung.
	   He mixes them with sulfur.
<b>491	THE BLACK POWDER									   491
</b>	   is bound up in a small satchel and affixed to an arrow.
<b>492	GOLD TOOTH										    492
</b>	   lights the fuse with a torch.
<b>493	ASH												 493
</b>	   draws back and releases the arrow. ZING!
<b>494	THE ARROW											494
</b>	   imbeds in a wooden post and EXPLODES. Large pieces of wood are
	   sent flying.
<b>495	ARTHUR'S WARRIORS									  495
</b>	   watch in awe.
<b>496	EXT. CASTLE LOOKOUT TOWER - DUSK						  496
</b><b>	   THE CASTLE BELL
</b>	   is rung madly.  The signal for battle stations.
<b>497	A WARRIOR											497
</b>	   rides in through the castle gates screaming:
<b>					   WARRIOR
</b>			   They're coming!  The Deadites
			   approach!
<b>498	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   498
</b>	   A look of shock and fear on all the faces.  ASH comes into
	   frame.  CAMERA CRANES UP with him as he scales the ladder to
	   the lookout tower. He peers out to the darkening horizon.
<b>499	ASH												 499
</b>	   hears them before he sees them: The sound of clicking bones.
	   Painful moans of tortured souls, the clanging of approaching
	   armor.
<b>500	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE HORIZON							   500
</b>	   Fifty distant silhouettes of the Evil Dead appear on the
	   horizon.  Then fifty more.
<b>501	EXT. BATTLEFIELD TRACKING SHOT						    501
</b><b>	   THREE KILTED SKELETON SCOTSMEN
</b>	   play rotted bagpipes as they march toward the castle. A haunted
	   battle melody. Behind them...
<b>502	SKELETON #1										   502
</b>	   plays the drums upon a set of hollow skulls.
<b>503	SKELETON #2										   503
</b>	   takes a leg bone upon a third skeleton's ribs. A bone xylophone.
	   A bone-o-phone.
<b>504	SKELETON #3, #4 AND #5								  504
</b>	   blow into arm bones forming woodwind section.
<b>505	FOUR VIKING SKELETONS								   505
</b>	   CAMERA TRACKING with these helmeted skeletons as they march.
	   They are clad in rusting suits of armor, wielding swords and
	   spears.  Nasty grins on their faces. One hobbles past on his
	   wooden leg.
<b>506	EVIL ASH AND SHEILA									506
</b>	   ride their steeds to a halt atop a hill.
<b>507	A SKELETON AND DEADITE CAPTAIN						    507
</b>	   ride alongside Evil Ash and salute him sharply.
<b>					   SKELETON CAPTAIN
</b>			   M'Lord!  We are positioned on both
			   fronts!
<b>					   EVIL ASH
</b>			   Where are they keeping my book?
<b>					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
</b>			   Most likely...there, in the
			   castle's keep. It would be the
			   safest place.  It is behind two
			   walls that must be taken first.
<b>					   EVIL ASH
</b>			   Excellent. Proceed.
<b>508	SKELETON CAPTAIN #1									508
</b>	   With a sweep of his arm, he waves the Army of rot.
<b>					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
</b>			   Forward!
<b>509	THE MACABRE MARCHING BAND							    509
</b>	   now pound the attack beat on their drums.
<b>510	A LINE OF DEADITES									 510
</b>	   advance toward the castle. Some crouch behind wooden barricades
	   which they roll before them.
<b>511	EXT. CASTLE - ATOP THE WALL							  511
</b><b>	   ASH, ARTHUR AND THE WARRIORS
</b><b>					   ASH
</b>			   Arrows!
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Load!
<b>512	TWELVE ARCHERS										512
</b>	   pull back arrows on their bow strings.  Each arrow has a small
	   charge of black powder attached to it.
			   Torch boy!
<b>513	A TORCH BOY										   513
</b>	   runs behind the archers, lighting the fuses on each of the
	   powder charges. As the last arrow is lit....
<b>514	ARTHUR											   514
</b>	   looks to the approaching army.
<b>515	THE LINE OF DEADITES								    515
</b>	   rolls their wooden barricades closer.
<b>516	ARTHUR											   516
</b>	   turns to Ash for the signal.
<b>517	ASH												 517
</b>	   holds up a finger.  He waits.
<b>518	TWELVE ARCHERS										518
</b>	   strain, their bows taut with the explosive arrows.  The sound
	   of the FUSE BURNING is loud.
<b>519	THE BURNING FUSES									  519
</b>	   about to disappear into the powder charges.
<b>520	ASH												 520
</b>	   waits one more beat.  The turns to Arthur.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Fire!
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Fire!
<b>521	TWELVE ARCHERS										521
</b>	   fire a volley of smoking arrows.
<b>522	SMOKING AND SPUTTERING ARROWS							522
</b>	   rain down from the castle wall.
<b>523	TWO WOODEN BARRICADES								   523
</b>	   are hit with the explosive arrows. They explode.
<b>524	THREE DEADITES										524
</b>	   are pierced by the explosive arrows.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  They burst
	   apart in flames.
<b>525	FLAMING DEADITES									   525
</b>	   roll on the ground unable to extinguish themselves.
<b>526	A BURNING SKELETON									 526
</b>	   continues to advance only to collapse into a smoldering heap.
<b>527	THE WARRIORS										  527
</b>	   CHEER Ash in sensurround.
<b>528	A SCOUT											  528
</b>	   races up to Ash.
<b>					   SCOUT
</b>			   M'Lord!  A second division
			   approaching from the South.
<b>529	ASH												 529
</b>	   turns to the South.
<b>530	A SECOND WAVE A DEADITES								530
</b>	   approach.
<b>					   ASH
</b><b>			   CATAPULTS...SOUTH!

<b>532	GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							532
</b>	   hoist large sacks of black powder onto spoons of the catapults.
	   Their fuses are lit.
<b>533	ASH												 533
</b>	   gestures. Swords slice through lines which send giant sacks of
	   black powder catapulting.
<b>534	LONG SHOT - CASTLE									 534
</b>	   Three flaming projectiles whine as they hurl over the castle
	   walls.
<b>535	THREE FALLING SATCHELS P.O.V.'S						   535
</b>	   CAMERA CRANING DOWN toward the skeletons as they look upward
	   in horror.
	   BOOM!  The first blast takes out a skeleton horse and rider. Bones
	   fly.
	   BOOM!  FOUR DEADITES are obliterated.
<b>536	EVIL ASH											 536
</b>	   turns to the Skeleton Captain #1 who rides alongside him.
<b>					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
</b>			   Permission to regroup, m'Lord.
<b>					   EVIL ASH
</b>			   You needn't bother.
<b>537	EVIL ASH											 537
</b>	   slices off the head of Skeleton Captain #1. He turns to the
	   MOUNTED DEADITE next to him.
<b>					   EVIL ASH
</b>			   You are now my captain. I will
			   now allow anything to stop me from
			   possessing the Necronomicon. Get
			   me into that castle.
<b>538	THE NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN								 538
</b>	   gulps and races forward into the ranks shouting:
<b>					   NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN
</b><b>			   RAM THE GATES!
</b><b>539	TWO GROUPS OF FOUR SKELETONS							 539
</b>	   use trees as battering rams and batter the large wooden doors
	   of the castle.
<b>	   BOOM!-BOOM!
</b><b>540	INT. CASTLE - THE CASTLE DOORS						    540
</b>	   begin to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
<b>541	TWO VILLAGE WOMEN									  541
</b>	   scream!
<b>542	TEN WARRIORS										  542
</b>	   wedge logs to buttress the buckling castle doors.
<b>543	EXT. CASTLE										   543
</b><b>					   EVIL ASH
</b>			   Arrows!
<b>544	A ROW OF SIX SKELETAL ARCHERS							544
</b>	   fire a volley of arrows. As they reload. Behind them...
<b>545	A SECOND LINE OF SIX SKELETAL ARCHERS					  545
</b>	   fire their arrows.
<b>546	A VOLLEY OF DEADITES' ARROWS							 546
</b>	   pierce five Warriors atop the castle wall. They fall.
<b>547	INT. CASTLE										   547
</b><b>	   TWO DEAD WARRIORS
</b>	   fall to the courtyard. Villagers lift them away on stretchers.
<b>548	ARTHUR											   548
</b>	   shouts to Ash:
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Where is Henry?!
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   He'll be here.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   I think he will not. But know
			   this.  No matter how this battle
			   fares, I was wrong to think you
			   a coward.
<b>549	EXT. CASTLE										   549
</b>	   The battering rams rips through the doors and the army of
	   darkness pours into the courtyard.
<b>550	A LEGLESS SKELETON									 550
</b>	   crawls in with a knife in its teeth.
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   They're coming in. What now?!
<b>551	ASH												 551
</b>	   looks terrified. He turns and runs from the castle entrance,
	   dropping his sword, and hides in the blacksmith's shop, pulling
	   the door closed behind him.
<b>552	ARTHUR											   552
</b>	   shocked at Ash's cowardly desertion, turns to his men and
	   shouts:
<b>					   ARTHUR
</b>			   Fall back!  Man the Parapet!  Protect
			   the book or God save us all!
<b>553	THE WARRIORS										  553
</b>	   retreat across the courtyard to rope ladders that scale the
	   parapet.
<b>554	ARTHUR'S MEN CLIMB ATOP THE PARAPET					    554
</b>	   The rope ladders are hastily pulled up, leaving no access.
<b>555	INT. COURTYARD - SIX OF ARTHUR'S WARRIORS				   555
</b>	   are stranded in the courtyard. They fight for their lives but
	   are quickly overcome.
<b>556	EVIL SHEILA										   556
</b>	   takes out the last of the stranded warriors with her sword.
<b>557	EVIL ASH											 557
</b>	   smiles at Sheila. He turns his attention to the guarded tower
	   just beyond the parapet.
<b>					   EVIL ASH
</b>			   The book shall be mine!
	   He raises his rusty sword.
<b>			   LADDERS!
</b><b>558	TWELVE EVIL DEAD									   558
</b>	   storm the parapet with three crudely built wooden ladders as
	   large rocks rain down upon them from above.
<b>559	TWO WARRIORS										  559
</b>	   push away ladder #1.
<b>560	FOUR SKELETONS ON LADDER #1							  560
</b>	   swing away from the wall and crash to the ground.
<b>561	TWO SKELETONS ON LADDER #2							   561
</b>	   leap onto the parapet and battle the men with swords.
<b>562	WARRIOR #2										    562
</b>	   knocks the deadite off the ledge and shouts back toward Arthur.
<b>					   WARRIOR #2
</b>			   We can't hold this wall much
			   longer!
<b>563	A DEADITE ARROW									    563
</b>	   pierces his armor and he falls to his death.
<b>564	INT. COURTYARD										564
</b><b>	   A VIKING DEADITE
</b>	   looks up as he hears...
<b>	   CHUG!  CHUG!  CHUG!
</b><b>565	DEADITE'S P.O.V.									   565
</b><b>	   THE DOORS OF THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP BURST OPEN
</b>	   Through the dust and smoke something appears...An iron
	   beast...belching steam...It's angry iron blades whirling.
	   Behold...
<b>566	THE DEATHCOASTER									   566
</b>	   The stripped chaise of the Delta  88 Oldsmobile. A steam engine
	   is mounted to it's center to power the craft. At the front and
	   rear are spinning, helicopter like rotor blades.
<b>567	GOLD TOOTH										    567
</b>	   shovels coal into the Deathcoaster's furnace.
<b>568	ASH												 568
</b>	   is at the helm. He pulls a cord.
<b>569	THE DEATHCOASTER'S STEAM WHISTLE						  569
</b>	   SCREAMS to announce its birth.
<b>570	THE VIKING DEADITE									 570
</b>	   is cut to ribbons by swirling blades.
<b>571	THE VILLAGERS ATOP THE PARAPET						    571
</b>	   cheer!
<b>572	EVIL DEAD											572
</b>	   at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see...
<b>573	THE STEAM DRIVEN ROTOR BLADES							573
</b>	   slicing through two Deadites at once. The cow-catcher in front
	   pushes aside the halved Evil Dead.
<b>574	ASH												 574
</b>	   operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer
	   the craft. It's a bumpy ride.
<b>575	WIDE SHOT - THE DEATHCOASTER							 575
</b>	   Thwop!  Thwop!  Two more skeletons bite the dust.
	   leathery hands pluck a SCREAMING Gold Tooth from the craft.
<b>576	GOLD TOOTH										    576
</b>	   disappears beneath the squirming corpses. A moment later he re-
	   emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth
	   that shines against the white of the bone. He stands and joins
	   the Deadites.
<b>577	EVIL SHEILA										   577
</b>	   leaps onto the moving Deathcoaster to face Ash.
<b>					   EVIL SHEILA
</b>			   Thou didst find me beautiful once.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   Honey...You got real ugly.
<b>578	EVIL SHEILA										   578
</b>	   attacks with a SHRIEK!
<b>579	ASH												 579
</b>	   spins out his double barreled shot gun and...
<b>	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
</b>	   ...blows her off the craft. She does a back flip into the other
	   Deadites.
<b>580	ASH												 580
</b>	   pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the
	   craft.
<b>581	THE DEATHCOASTER									   581
</b>	   careens out of control.
<b>582	ASH												 582
</b>	   tumbles from the helm and hits the ground.
<b>583	THE DEATHCOASTER									   583
</b>	   flips, crushes a group of Deadites against a wall, and explodes.
<b>584	ASH												 584
</b>	   picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to...
<b>585	LADDER #2 - ARTHUR									 585
</b>	   attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,
	   stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!  Evil
	   Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto
	   the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.
<b>586	BELOW IN THE COURTYARD - ASH							 586
</b>	   races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two
	   deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and
	   slices one end of it with his sword.
<b>587	ABOVE HIM - A NET OF BOULDERS							587
</b>	   plummet down atop the two deadites, crushing them.
	   Simultaneously, Ash is tanked upward by the rope, to the
	   parapet.
<b>588	ASH												 588
</b>	   looks to...
<b>589	EVIL ASH											 589
</b>	   approaching the Necronomicon.
<b>590	ASH												 590
</b>	   kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four
	   flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires.
<b>591	A FLAME ARROW										 591
</b>	   imbeds in Evil Ash's leg and ignites his body. Another flaming
	   dart hits his shoulder blade. The flames consume his body. He
	   burns and SHRIEKS!
<b>592	ASH												 592
</b>	   watches in horror as...
<b>593	THE FLAMES RECEED									  593
</b>	   revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes. SKELETAL
	   EVIL ASH!  It races at Ash with a SHRIEK.
<b>594	ASH AND EVIL ASH									   594
</b>	   bring their swords together with such great force that sparks
	   fly.  Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds
	   the Necronomicon.
<b>	   CLANG!
</b>	   With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand.
<b>595	ASH'S SWORD										   595
</b>	   imbeds in a wooden beam.
<b>596	EVIL ASH											 596
</b>	   grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash.
<b>597	ASH												 597
</b>	   grabs a burning iron torch from its mount.
<b>598	ANGLE ON											 598
</b><b>	   WHOOSH!  KLANG!  WHOOSH!  KLANG!
</b>	   Man and Skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword.
<b>599	ANGLE ON											 599
</b><b>	   KLANG!
</b>	   The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge
	   of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse.
	   The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits
	   upon the spoon of a catapult.
<b>600	ABOVE...											 600
</b><b>	   SKELETON ASH
</b>	   swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings
	   downward, and Ash side steps it.
<b>601	ASH												 601
</b>	   rabbit punches CAMERA.
<b>602	CLOSE ON SKELETON HEAD								  602
</b>	   Ash's fist bursts out all it's rotted teeth.
<b>603	ASH												 603
</b>	   delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in
	   a circle.
<b>604	THE SKELETON										  604
</b>	   gives Ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles
	   over the edge.
<b>605	ASH												 605
</b>	   falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances
	   at the burning fuse.
<b>606	EVIL ASH											 606
</b>	   leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton
	   looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone.
<b>607	SKELETON ASH										  607
</b>	   Behold...
	   He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now
	   battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the
	   Keep.
<b>608	ANGLE ON SKELETON ASH								   608
</b><b>					   SKELETON ASH

	   He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash.
<b>					   SKELETON ASH
</b>			   I possess the Necronomicon. I've
			   crushed your pathetic army. Now
			   I'll have my vengeance!
	   He raises his sword for the death blow...

</b>			   Duke Henry's men!  They've come!
<b>610	ASH AND THE SKELETON								    610

	   A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as...
<b>611	DUKE HENRY THE RED AND FIFTY OF HIS MEN					611
</b>	   thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle
	   courtyard to attack the Deadites!
<b>612	THE SKELETON - ATOP THE CATAPULT						  612
</b>	   turns back to Ash and raises his sword for the kill.
<b>613	ASH												 613
</b>	   has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion
	   he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton
	   Ash.
<b>614	ASH												 614
</b>	   snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices
	   through the rope, springing the catapult.

	   A CHEER goes up within the castle courtyard as Henry's Warriors
	   crush the last of the Deadites.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:

<b>618	LONG SHOT - THE BATTLEFIELD - MORNING					  618

<b>					   WISEMAN JOHN

</b>			   I took a drink.
	   Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth!  A
	   7th drop!  Ash swallows the liquid.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   I didn't know if it was day or
			   night. I started... to get
			   drowsy... And I slept...
<b>632	ASH												 632
</b>	   falls into a deep slumber.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>633	THE DEATHCOASTER'S HEADLIGHTS							633
</b>	   fade.
<b>									   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>634	CLOSER ON ASH'S SLEEPING FACE							634
</b>	   now in a different position. Time has passed. He needs a shave.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   ...And dreamed.
<b>635	THE HANDS ON ASH'S WRISTWATCH							635
</b>	   wind faster and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse
	   photography. The leather band rots away and the watch falls from
	   Ash's wrist.
<b>636	THE SUN											  636
</b>	   rises then sets.
<b>637	THE MOON											 637
</b>	   follows.
<b>638	A CRACK											  638
</b>	   forms along the surface of the aging rock wall.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   Dreams last lasted centuries.

<b>639	A BARREN TREE										 639
</b>	   sprouts buds, they swell forming leaves which change to the
	   brilliant colors of fall then drop.
<b>640	A FROST											  640
</b>	   covers Ash.
<b>641	ICICLES											  641
</b>	   on the ceiling of the cave melt.  The water drops down onto
	   Ash's face.  He stirs.
<b>642	ASH												 642
</b>	   awakens in a heap of rusted scrap, which was once the
	   Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having deteriorated, he is
	   buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave. He digs
	   at the rocks that block the cave's entrance.  Sunlight streams
	   into the hole he has created.
<b>643	EXT. HILLSIDE										 643
</b><b>	   ASH
</b>	   climbs from the cave and steps into the sunlight.
<b>					   ASH (V.O.)
</b>			   And when I awoke...
<b>644	ASH												 644
</b>	   beholds...
<b>645	A FUTURISTIC CITY -									645
</b>	   after the next Nuclear war: a dead land.
<b>646	ASH'S P.O.V.										  646
</b><b>	   A FRACTURED CLOCK TOWER
</b>	   lays sprawled on its side.  The time of mankind's death frozen
	   on the cracked face of the clock.
<b>647	A SHATTERED BRIDGE									 647
</b>	   abruptly ends, a third of the way across a river it once
	   spanned.  Upon it, rest heaps of futuristic, yet rusted taxicabs
	   piled eight deep in some places.
	   CAMERA PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash, amidst the atomized pieces
	   of iron and bone.
<b>					   ASH
</b>			   ....I found that I had slept too
			   long.
<b>648	ASH												 648
</b>	   is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't
	   hear his terrified SCREAM!
<b>									   CUT TO BLACK.
</b><b>							  THE END.
