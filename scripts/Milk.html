          1970's tape recorder.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
</b>          This is Harvey Milk speaking on
          Friday November 18th. This is to be
          played only in the event of my
          death by assassination...
          REVEAL: HARVEY MILK, 48, sitting at his kitchen table in a
          cluttered San Francisco apartment.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          During one of the early campaigns,
          I started opening my speeches with
          the same line and it sort of became
          my signature...

<b>          2 EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT
</b>
          In street clothes, trying to corral an angry mob on City
          Hall's steps, Harvey lifts a bullhorn.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm
          here to recruit you.

</b>
          Harvey at his kitchen table making his recording...

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          If I was speaking to a slightly
          hostile or mostly straight
          audience, I'd try to break the
          tension with a joke...

<b>          4 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT
</b>
          Harvey is in a plain, ill fitting brown suit making a
          CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I know, I know, I'm not what you
          were expecting, but I left my high
          heels at home.
          Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I fully realize that a person who
          stands for what I stand for - an
          activist, a gay activist - becomes
          the target or potential target for
          a person who is insecure,
          terrified, afraid or very disturbed
          themselves...

<b>          6 INT. CITY HALL OFFICES - MONTAGE - DAY
</b>
          POLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City
          Hall, their walkie-talkies squawking. Something terrible has
          happened. It's chaos.
          A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE. On it, a FILLED BODY
          BAG with a WHITE SHEET draped over it.
          The press rush to get a shot. The police officers quickly
          load the body onto the elevator and disappear from sight.

</b>
          A shell shocked DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 45, wades into a throng of
          REPORTERS. Those surrounding her try to quiet the crowd.

<b>          DIANNE FEINSTEIN
</b>          As President of the Board of
          Supervisors, it's my duty to make
          this announcement. Both Mayor
          Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk
          have been shot... and killed.
          GASPS from the REPORTERS. Dianne struggles to be heard.

</b>          Police are looking for a suspect...

</b>
          The very picture of loveliness, MARY-ANN WHITE, 28, finds her
          husband DAN WHITE, 31, sitting in the pews praying. He's a
          handsome, devout, all-American man in a three-piece suit.
          She sits by him. A weight hangs. He can't make eye contact.

</b>          She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side. She
          holds him, firmly gripping the revolver in his holster, to
          conceal, to keep him from using it, potentially on himself.

<b>          11 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
</b>
          RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder...

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Knowing that I could be assassinated
          at any moment, I feel it's important
          that some people should understand
          my thoughts. I think that--
          (pauses, not sure what to say)
          I wish I had time to explain
          everything I did. Almost everything
          that was done was done with an eye
          on the gay movement.

           TITLE: "New York City. 1970."
          HARVEY, 40, is HEADING UP THE STAIRS from the subway
          platform. He is wearing a SUIT, but he's less than clean cut.
          His hair is brushing past his ears.
          HARVEY'S VERY INTERESTED POV: SCOTT SMITH, 22, a sexy curly
          haired hippie in tight jeans and boots, is HEADING DOWN THE
          THE STAIRS. Harvey tries to make eye contact.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Hey. I'm Harvey.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (so what?)
          Okay, Harvey...

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Today's my birthday.
          (Scott laughs)
          No, today is actually my birthday.
          Well, tonight. At midnight.

</b>          Really?

</b>
<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          And, believe it or not, I don't
          have any plans. People took me out
          after work...

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (looking him over)
          Work? So, that would be... Let me
          guess. Ma Bell or AT&T.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          The Great American Insurance
          Company. I'm part of the big,
          evil, corporate establishment that,
          let me guess, you think is the
          cause of every evil thing in the
          world from Vietnam to diaper rash.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          You left out bad breath.
          Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth. Scott laughs. They
          both smile, realizing they share a wry sense of humor.
          A TRAIN IS COMING, Harvey has to work fast.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          So... You're not going to let me
          celebrate my birthday all by myself
          are you?

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (gently teasing)
          Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute
          for a suit... But I don't do guys
          over forty.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Well then, I'm in luck.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          How's that?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Because I'm still thirty-nine...
          (showing Scott his watch)
          And it's only eleven-fifteen.

</b>
          IN A TIGHT TWO-SHOT, Scott is pressed against a wall with
          Harvey pressed against his back having sex. Harvey is the
          aggressor, completely uninhibited.

</b>
          Harvey feeds Scott spoonfuls of CREAM PIE from a TRAY FULL of
          FOOD that rests on the bed between them. Ice cream, cookies,
          milk, berries... It's over the top and adorable.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Where are you from?

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Jackson, Mississippi.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Well, this isn't Jackson, but you
          still can't respond to every
          strange man you meet on a subway
          platform. It's too dangerous.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Now you tell me.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          There's nothing tougher than a New
          York City cop. They're arrogant,
          and they're everywhere. I'll show
          you the cruising spots, if you
          want, if you promise you'll be
          careful... little Scottie-san.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Are you on uppers or what?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          No. This is just... plain old me.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          You're afraid of the cops?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'm just discreet. I know a lot of
          people here. If they found out, I
          could lose my job.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (meaning a closet case)
          Oh. You're one of "those."
          (examines Harvey's eyes)
          I think you need a change of
          scenery. New friends.

</b>          I need a change.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (looks at the clock)
          You're forty now.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (just the truth)
          Forty years old and I haven't done
          a thing I'm proud of.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          (re: the desert tray)
          You keep eating like this and
          you'll be a fat ass by fifty.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (laughs it off)
          No. Don't you worry. I won't make
          it to fifty.
          Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding,
          he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face.
          Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his
          young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting
          everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair.

</b>          But by 1972, The Haight was boarded
          up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The
          new place for us refugees was this
          run down Irish Catholic
          neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six
          blocks square... The Castro.

<b>          17 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY

          Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of
          Castro Street.

<b>          WE SEE WHAT HARVEY SEES THROUGH THE LENS: A HARDWARE STORE,
</b>          a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows...
          Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro
          Theater, big letters spelling out... "C A S T R O..."
          Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray-
          haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his
          face, an expression of distrust.
          Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads:

<b>          "EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY."
</b>          Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS
          WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's
          eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling.
          Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT
          SIGN hanging out front.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          I suppose I can wait tables.

<b>          HARVEY
</b>          No way. I want you right here with

          is for rent?

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Yeah.

<b>          HARVEY MILK

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          What kind of shop?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          One with very little overhead. Not

          Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a CAMERA
          STORE (with a few, not very impressive, products).
          Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside
          the store's large window hanging a sign: "CASTRO CAMERA."

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Just a little to the left...
          The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses
          the street to watch. Harvey gives him a warm welcome:

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          Hello there. I'm Harvey Milk.

<b>          MCCONNELLY
</b>          You're the new renters?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Yes. Welcome to Castro Camera.

</b>          Harvey extends his hand. McConnelly shakes, but is wary.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          I want to join the, um... What is
          it? The Eureka Valley Merchant's
          Association. I want to help in any
          way possible. I'm no interloper.
          A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll
          forgive that.
          McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.

<b>          MCCONNELLY
</b>          I don't think your application will
          be approved, Mr. Milk. This is a
          family neighborhood. Your kind are
          far more welcome on Haight street.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (trying to keep it friendly)
          What "kind" do you mean, sir?

<b>          MCCONNELLY
</b>          (not playing along)
          The Merchant's Association will
          have the police pull your license
          if you open your doors.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Based on what law?

<b>          MCCONNELLY
</b>          There's man's law and there's God's
          law in this neighborhood and in this
          City. The San Francisco Police
          force is happy to enforce either.

<b>          HARVEY MILK

          They must have some gay customers.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Harvey. What's with all this
          political activist crap? I thought
          you were a goddamn Republican.
          Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of
          food. He sets them out on a small dining room table, still
          rambling on to Scott in the bedroom.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'm a businessman, Scott. I think
          businesses ought to treat their
          customers right. Even their gay
          customers. For God's sake, this is
          San Francisco!

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Harvey. It's just like every other
          city in this country. People hate
          us. Big surprise.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          We should have at least one block
          in one city right? Start there and
          take over the neighborhood.
          (a smile)
          Okay, you can come in now!
          Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a
          home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Wow. This is--

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Happy birthday!
          Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear
          some of the CREAM PIE onto him.

<b>          22 EXT. THE CASTRO - DAY
</b>
          The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street
          Fair. The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate
          outside Toad Hall bar.
          ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about,
          eyeing the scene skeptically.
          Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.

<b>          MAN ON THE STREET
</b>          Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk!

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Thanks for joining the Castro
          Village Association!
          Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the
          Irish liquor store (from earlier). He squeezes past them,
          into the store, leaving Scott outside.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          Excuse me gentleman... ladies.
          (finding the shop owner)
          Hello! Mr. McConnelly!
          McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new
          business.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          I just wanted to stop in and see
          how business was doing.

<b>          MCCONNELLY
</b>          Fine.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          So you don't mind all these
          homosexuals in here, do you?
          McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is
          curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180.

          (to McConnelly)
          Tell your wife Hello for me.
          Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM,
          KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step
          back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing.
          Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins him
          through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new
          neighborhood.

<b>          23 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

<b>           HARVEY MILK
</b>          And people started hanging around
          our store. Not customers.
          Activists, kids, folks who needed a
          home away from home...

<b>          26 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - INTERCUT

          A NEW sign goes in the window: "We are VERY open."

<b>          27 INT. CASTRO CAMERA SHOP - DAY
</b>
          A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings
          of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a
          clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the
          arts, and checking out the cute ones.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
</b>          There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute
          art student who I'd picked up at
          Toad Hall. Turns out he was also
          good at running the Camera Shop...
          something Scott and I found we had
          surprising little interest in...
          ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless.

<b>          DANNY NICCOLETTA
</b>          Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about
          street theater, now.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          What you're not getting is the
          spectacle of it, the bigger than
          life emotions...
          Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of
          an opera diva, making Harvey laugh.

</b>          Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great
          wit. A Harvard graduate, which
          nobody cared about, in those days,
          in the Castro... including himself.
          JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that
          sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for
          something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young
          man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And somewhere along the line Jim
          picked up a protege, a cute
          political kid from Wisconsin... Dick
          Pabich... And of course there was
          Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular
          business with the new kids...
          DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And on occasion we actually had a
          real customer. But only occasionally.
          ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of
          place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Harvey... This guy wants to talk to
          you.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (approaches Allan)
          Welcome. What can we do for you?

<b>          ALLAN BAIRD
</b>          Hi, I'm Allan Baird. Teamsters
          representative, and Director of the
          Coors beer boycott in California.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's
          a very big deal, so behave
          yourselves.

<b>          ALLAN BAIRD
</b>          I was told you were like the Mayor
          of the Castro, said you organized
          the CVA, you might know some people
          in the bars.

          places, but just so you know, it's
          not official yet.

<b>          ALLAN BAIRD
</b>          What's that?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          The Mayor part. I've considered
          gathering an army of queers to
          march up to City Hall and secede,
          but so far the young gays seem more
          interested in jeeps and jeans. But
          if I could be of any use, I'm all
          ears!

<b>          ALLAN BAIRD
</b>          We can't get Coors to go union.
          These guys are like me, they can't
          be out of work too long.
          Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his
          nerves. It's Harvey at his best.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I'm just curious. Are we your first
          stop or your last?

<b>          ALLAN BAIRD
</b>          (clearly his last)
          It's been a tough one, Mr. Milk.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Well, you seem to have noticed that
          my kind of people drink a lot of
          beer. If we're going to fast for
          your sake, I think we should get to
          deliver some of it when you win
          this fight, don't you?

<b>          ALLAN BAIRD
</b>
<b>          (INCREDULOUS)
</b>          Is that what you really want?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          And allies. I'll have Coors out of
          every bar in the Castro by the end
          of the week. Deal?

<b>          ALLAN BAIRD
</b>          (nods, sincere)

          the counter to Scott.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          No more Coors beer. It's gotta come
          out of every bar. Gay and straight.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          What's he giving you?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Nothing for me. That's a convert.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          A convert to what?

</b>          The cause.

          owners throughout San Francisco to unscrew their Coors taps,
          throw out their Coors stock, put on "Boycott Coors" buttons
          and tape up "Dump Coors" posters.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
</b>          I got "my people" to get Coors out
          of all the Gay Bars. 30 million
          bottles worth in San Francisco
          alone. Coors beer immediately fell
          from number 1. They caved. One week
          later, union man Allan Baird hired
          the first ever openly gay union
          boys to drive Teamsters trucks...
          We weren't just a group of pansies
          anymore. We had a neighborhood. We
          had the unions. And for the first
          time, we had a little bit of power.

          Harvey, Scott, Jim, Dick, Dennis run up the street toward one
          of the Castro GAY BARS where POLICE ARE GETTING OUT OF SQUAD
          CARS AND APPROACHING CUSTOMERS crowding around the entrance.

<b>          COP
</b>          Clear the sidewalk!
          Some of the GAY MEN move out of the COPS' way but some of
          them don't move FAST ENOUGH. The COPS start BEATING them.
          Harvey, Scott and the OTHERS try to break into the crowd, to
          get closer to the fight. To pull the cops off their friends.
          Danny HANGS BACK, snapping PHOTOS of the event.
          Scott SHOVES his way past the cops. A COP BRINGS HIS NIGHT

          Scott sits on the toilet. Harvey rinses blood from a white

          Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER. It

          sway drunk out of his mind, waiting for him to fall. The two
          make eye contact. Harvey smiles. Jack tries to. Harvey picks

          Off a TV in Scott's NEW APARTMENT, we see a S.F. Morning show
          featuring new Supervisors, Harvey Milk and Dan White.

<b>          HOST (ON TV)
</b>          This will be the first time in many
          years that we've seen so many new

          cripple the Board?

</b>          The name of the game on the Board
          is six votes to get anything
          passed. So, like it or not, Dan
          and I are now in bed together...
          politically speaking.
          THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching the program. He's been up
          all night.

<b>          DAN WHITE (ON TV)
</b>          I've assured Harvey here that my
          brochure's comments about "social
          deviants" referred more to junkies
          than to his people. See, I'm about
          to have my first child. I have to

</b>          How long were you a fireman, Dan?

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          A couple of years.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          And before that... You were a
          police officer?
          Dan studies Harvey suspiciously... What's his point?

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          You have something against cops?

<b>          HARVEY MILK

          Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him
          through a simple dance.

</b>          I watched TV here today. All day. I
          saw All My Children. They killed
          Margo. I knew it was going to
          happen. They try and trick you but
          it never works.

          I think now the old lady is going
          to have an affair. Then she'll get
          killed or married. Always one or
          the other. Dead or married.

</b>          Not great. State Senator John
          Briggs is Anita Bryant's go-to guy
          in California for sure. He's filed
          his petition for a statewide
          referendum to fire all gay teachers
          and anyone who supports them.
          A pall falls over the room. This is worse than expected.

</b>          And how are you going to determine
          who's a homosexual?

          Rick and David are horrified. Phil Burton rises above it,
          passing out copies of his new Anti-Briggs Initiative flier.

</b>          With the heat bearing down on your

          best to dodge the "gay" bullet. Go
          for the human rights angle.

</b>          Across the country, a handful of
          city councils had passed the very
          first ordinances protecting gay
          people against discrimination. But
          Anita Bryant and her right wing
          Christian fundamentalists were
          creating and exploiting and fanning
          a backlash. Now she had referenda
          to repeal all of these gay rights
          ordinances. While we were preparing
          for the battle against Briggs and
          Prop Six, Anita Bryant was taking
          her show on the road... sweeping
          the country. Her next stop was
          Wichita, Kansas.

          CHYRON: "Landslide: Wichita says NO to Gays." Anita talks to

</b>          I give thanks for all of our foot
          soldiers of God here in Wichita.
          But we must push on. Look what

          makeshift stage. He lifts the bullhorn and with nerves, reads
          a speech. Its pages blow about.

</b>          Forty years ago tonight, the gay
          citizens of Germany found out they
          no longer had civil rights.
          Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens
          of Wichita will also awaken to find
          that they too have lost their civil
          rights. You have whistles. You use

</b>          Fuck. Shit. Harvey!
          Cleve runs as fast as he can to cut through the crowd, to get

          Dan's attempts to be witty and erudite (like Harvey) only
          leave him confused and tongue tied.
          Harvey HAS NO IDEA why Dan is here.

          Dan PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HARVEY for a sort-of macho but
          really weird birthday hug. Harvey stiffens, it's such a

          Dan. I've had four relationships in
          my life. Three of those four tried
          to kill themselves. I know it was
          my fault they did it. I told them
          to stay quiet. To hide. Most of my
          life I've been closeted. That's

          fighting for.
          Jack emerges from the bathroom, barely together and leans on
          Harvey. Dan steps back from Harvey and Jack, his moment
          alone stolen away.

          to recruit you. I want to recruit
          you for the fight to preserve your
          democracy. Brothers and sisters, you
          must come out. Come out to your
          parents. I know that it is hard and
          will hurt them but think about how
          they will hurt you in the voting
          booth! Come out to your friends, if
          they indeed are your friends. Come
          out to your neighbors, to your
          fellow workers. Once and for all,
          break down the myths, destroy the
          lies and distortions. For your sake.
          For their sake. For the sake of the
          youngsters who are becoming scared
          by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On
          the Statue of Liberty it says "Give
          me your tired, your poor, your
          huddled masses yearning to be free."
          In the Declaration of Independence
          it is written "All men are created
          equal and are endowed with certain
          inalienable rights." For Mr. Briggs
          and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots
          out there, no matter how hard you
          try, you cannot erase those words
          from the Declaration of
          Independence. No matter how hard you
          try, you cannot chip those words
          from off the base of the Statue of
          Liberty. That is what America is.
          Love it or leave it.

          Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for

</b>          I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to
          fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          No sir. I would love to have a
          public debate. I'm very interested
          in the details of your argument.

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS
</b>          You know the details. As do the
          people. Look at the votes across this

</b>          Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who
          believe in practicing bestiality to
          teach our children, and the reason
          we don't is because it is illegal.
          But it's not illegal to be a
          homosexual in California.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          And your law goes even further. Any
          school employee who even supports a

</b>          True. But, gay people don't have
          children of their own. If they
          don't recruit our children, they'd
          all die away. That's why they want

          heterosexual group! So why not get
          rid of the heterosexual teachers?
          Boos from the conservative audience.

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS
</b>          We are not talking about homos...
          child molestation, the fact is, at
          least 95 percent of the people are
          heterosexual. If we took
          heterosexuals out AND homosexuals
          out, you know what--

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) HARVEY MILK
</b>          --we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers--

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          --No child molestation... So you're
          saying the percentage of population
          is equal to the percentage of child
          molestation?

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS
</b>          (getting more lost)
          No, no, I'm not saying that at all--

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          That's what you just said.

<b>          JOHN BRIGGS
</b>          No. I'm saying that we cannot
          prevent child molestation so let's
          cut our odds down and take out the
          homosexual group and keep in the
          heterosexual group--
          Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument. Briggs
          looks down to his notes, lost. Harvey takes the opportunity
          to rip into the State Senator:

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (directly to Briggs)
          --Sir, in your own drive for
          personal power, how many careers
          are you willing to see destroyed?
          How many lives will you destroy in
          your lust for power, and when will
          you stop?
          The crowd boos, rails. This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange
          County. In the audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by
          the level of hatred. Harvey tries to maintain his composure.

<b>          120 EXT. CASTRO STREET - NIGHT

          Harvey heads home from work. He starts into his store.
          He sees JACK LIRA'S SHADOW through the curtains upstairs, and
          turns instead to the cafe next door.

<b>          121 INT. CASTRO CAFE - NIGHT
</b>
          Harvey sits down at the bar. The WAITER pours a coffee for
          him. Harvey looks up to the TV.
          HARVEY'S POV: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news reporter. It
          feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          All I'm really saying is, if we
          don't protect ourselves with this
          kind of legislation, a transvestite
          can show up at a public school with
          all the qualifications for teaching
          and they can't refuse to hire him.

          Harvey rushes from a packed session in the Supervisors'
          Chambers to his office. Anne is behind him. He picks up the
          phone. It seems urgent.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Hey Jack, what's wrong?

<b>          123 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT
</b>

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          Nothing. I just want to know when
          you'll be home.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          You just had them pull me out of my
          big vote on the dog shit ordinance.
          Did you do this on purpose, Jack?

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          It's poop, Harvey. Aren't I more
          important than poop?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Yes, but... I don't know when I'll
          be home. Maybe 6. 6:15.

<b>          JACK LIRA
</b>          Fine. 6:15.
          Harvey hangs up. His patience is slipping. He looks up in
          time to see Dan heading down the hall with his briefcase.

<b>          124 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS HALLWAY - DAY

          Harvey catches up to Dan who is on his way out.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Dan? How's the baby?

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          You didn't bring up Supervisor pay
          raises. In fact, I heard you plan
          to publicly oppose them.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          I heard you planned to vote against

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Dan, there's a vote to approve the
          police desegregation settlement,
          give me that and I'll consider
          backing pay raises.

<b>          DAN WHITE

          (Dan steams)
          Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out
          against Proposition Six. You're
          looking more and more out of touch.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          If I come out against Prop Six,
          it's only for the invasion of

</b>          (smiles, trying to lighten)
          And the potential witch hunts
          against you "straight people,"
          right?
          Dan tries hard to come up with a cogent response. He can't.
          His behavior is alarming. He sets down his briefcase.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          You underestimate me, Milk. You're
          very, very wrong about me.

<b>          HARVEY MILK

          A moment. Dan is on the verge of tears, hot angry tears.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
</b>          What is it, Dan? You can tell me.

<b>          DAN WHITE

          moment has passed. He picks up his briefcase and walks out of
          the building. Off Harvey, concerned.

<b>          125 EXT. CITY HALL - LATER
</b>
          Harvey walks home. A PASSERBY shouts:

<b>          PASSERBY
</b>          You're the asshole that just passed
          that dog shit thing aren't you? What

          What the heck do you have against

          The young folks surrounding the PASSERBY laugh and hoot at
          Harvey's joke. Even the harassing PASSERBY can't help but
          crack a grin. Harvey beams.

<b>          126 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Opening the door, Harvey finds a trail of voter registration
          cards, anti-Briggs literature, and Coors beer cans. Pushing
          through his fear, he carefully follows the cans and flyers up
          the stairs and through his apartment.
          Odd notes are taped to the walls. They all lead to a black
          velvet curtain with a note attached: "YOU'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE

<b>          CIRCUS, HARVEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY LAST ACT?"
</b>          Harvey pulls back the curtain to find Jack's body, cold and
          discolored, hanging from a beam by a noose.
          HARVEY CAN'T MOVE. He is mesmerized... horrified.
          He grabs a knife and frantically tries cutting Jack down. He
          cuts through the rope and FALLS TO THE FLOOR with the HEAVY

<b>          BODY.
</b>
<b>          127 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATER
</b>
          Scott arrives. Sitting very still, Harvey is being consoled
          by Cleve and Anne. Tears in his eyes, Harvey won't look up.

<b>          SCOTT SMITH
</b>          Harvey. Look at me. Look at me. You
          did everything you could.

</b>          I could have come home at six
          o'clock, not six-fifteen.
          Scott puts his arm around Harvey. Harvey buries his head.
          Anne helps Cleve take down Jack's many hidden notes. Cleve
          quietly reads a prominently placed one:

<b>          CLEVE JONES
</b>          "Beware. The ides. Of November."

<b>          127A INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

          Into the recorder as if re-living the event over again...

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Jack was gone. I didn't have time
          to mourn... There was no choice but
          to keep on... to keep fighting.

<b>          128 INT. BARNUM AND BAILEY CIRCUS / MAKE UP ROOM / S.F. - DAY

          Harvey sits in a make-up chair. A MAKE-UP artist is painting
          him up to look like a clown. Several other CITY OFFICIALS are
          in chairs beyond him. Harvey turns to the make-up artist.
          With sincere enthusiasm:

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Thank you for this great honor. But
          do you think once the magazine is
          done snapping pictures, maybe I
          could keep the suit for a while?

<b>          129 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
</b>
          Still made up from head to toe as a clown, Harvey walks the
          streets of San Francisco. He waves, smiles, poses for photos
          with tourists. It's a rare moment of grace. He jumps on a
          trolley headed toward Castro. He instantly captures the
          imagination of a small GIRL wearing a knit hat.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          (re: their hats)
          Would you like to trade with me?

<b>          130 INT. "NO ON SIX" CENTER / MARKET STREET - NIGHT

          THIS IS THE MOMENT. Harvey watches aides on the phones comb
          districts for voting results. Jim fills up a map on the wall.

<b>          DICK PABICH
</b>          San Bernadino is coming in. Not

          Harvey is stunned. Other districts follow with similar
          results. They go up in red on the map.

<b>          JIM RIVALDO
</b>          Imperial is 69% "for" so far.

</b>          Put it up on the board.
          Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss.
          He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot. Cleve comes up
          to Harvey, concerned.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)

</b>          I can have 15,000 people in an

          Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in
          LA county with green. On the other end of the phone, Harvey's

          we can come home again!
          The crowd goes WILD. Harvey BEAMS. Moscone walks up onto
          stage and lifts Harvey's hand. Harvey is now a member of the
          S.F. political elite. Cleve watches from afar as Harvey steps

          up, looking at Harvey, probing:

</b>          What's the matter?

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          You ever heard of sore losers? Well,

          Harvey walks down the hallway to his office, a spring in his
          step. There are nods, hellos if not outright deference from
          most passersby. His newfound political muscle is evident.
          He comes face to face with Dan White.

          Dan walks away from Harvey. He doesn't want to hear anything
          Harvey has to say.
          Harvey watches as Dan is met in the hallway by an OFFICER
          from the POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.

          Harvey watches as Dan follows the officer down the stairs to
          an ASSOCIATION MEETING ROOM on the next floor. When the DOOR
          OPENS, Harvey sees SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES from the Police
          Department wearing somber expressions.

          HARVEY'S POV: On City Hall's lawn, Dan is with the press. He
          looks up, seeing Harvey in his office window.

<b>          DAN WHITE
</b>          Say, Harve, can I see you for a

          Dan closes it. Harvey smiles, sensing something is off.
          Dan draws his revolver. Harvey raises his hand. Dan Fires.
          The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm.

<b>          HARVEY MILK
</b>          Oh no... N--
          Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help.

</b>          Harvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he
          falls to his knees, now facing the window. He staggers toward
          it. The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the
          Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it.

</b>          --If a bullet should enter my
          brain, let that bullet destroy
          every closet door... And that's
          all. I ask for the movement to
          continue. Because it's not about
          personal gain, not about ego, not
          about power... it's about the
          "us's" out there. Not only gays,
          but the Blacks, the Asians, the
          disabled, the seniors, the us's.
          Without hope, the us's give up--
          As the thousands of mourners arrive at City Hall, they place
          their candles around the statue of Lincoln.

<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          --I know you cannot live on hope
          alone, but without it, life is not
          worth living. So you, and you, and
          you...

          Harvey closes his note pad, puts down his pencil, and pushes
          stop on his recorder.
