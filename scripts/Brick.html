              hunched. His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the

              into the water beside it.1

          trimmed back in the editing process for clarity. The author has threatened to write it as
          a stand alone short story, but probably never will, so in a nutshell: when Brendan and
          Emily were still an item she started hanging out with Jerr, a small time dealer. Brendan
          didn't approve, so he partnered up with Jerr then ratted him out to Trueman. Emily
          found out, and that led to their breakup on the field, which we see in a flashback.

          lawn and trot into the street. Using parked cars as cover,

</b>          Between cars, Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and
          engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a
          black Mustang. Laura goes to him and speaks quickly.

          says something to him. Grunting something angrily, he gets
          in the car with the bald kid and peels off.
<b>          
</b>          Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house.
<b>          
</b>          When she is gone Brendan stands, throws a look back at the
          house and walks off down the street, towards the guard gate.

          and drains it. The suburban lights twinkle like stars.

</b>          A banner from 1973 in the window - "Coffee and Pie oh my!"
          A pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster.
          Their beady eyes follow Brendan in sync as he approaches.

</b>          Brendan takes cover as Dode stops by a white hatchback.
<b>          
</b>          A girl gets out of the car and embraces Dode. Her wrist is
          adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead
          girl's arm. Dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks
          back. He hands her a slip of paper, which she tucks into a
          brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket
          pocket. They embrace again, Dode walks off and the girl gets
          in her car.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan stumbles after the car, but it is quickly gone. He

          folding into darkness. Water rushes overhead, over concrete,
          concrete with a hole in it -- the runoff tunnel, just for an
          instant, then back underwater, screaming. Brendan choking,
          screaming, plunging upwards. A woman with no face falls from
          the darkness and kisses him, her long hair sweeping around
          him then pulling away. As the last strands slide off his
          face he wakes up with a start.
<b>          
</b>          The clock says 3:46. Brendan drips with sweat, breathing
          raggedly. He takes the paper and a pencil from the

</b>          He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad.
          People gather around in a wide circle.

<b>          
</b>          In the next moment Brendan cuts Brad off by putting his fist
          in his face.
<b>          
</b>          Brad grunts but doesn't lose ground. Brendan throws his
          short stocky frame into Brad's larger one and tenderizes his
          midsection with jabs.
<b>          
</b>          Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his
          hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the
          pavement.
<b>          
</b>          He comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched.

</b>          Brad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard
          with the point of Brad's chin. Brad gets his balance fast,
          and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself,
          then another, both into Brendan's stomach. Brendan pulls
          back and kicks Brad's shin where he had kicked it before.
          Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his
          weight into a square punch right into Brad's nose.

</b>          The sound of eggs breaking, and Brad falls backwards like a
          board.
<b>          
</b>          He stays down, holding his face.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the
          small crowd. Some stare at Brendan, some at Brad, but nobody
          seems about to do anything. Brendan runs his sleeve over his
          face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few
          people rushing over.

          mustang.

</b><b>          EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
</b><b>          
</b>          The sun hangs low. Brendan approaches the car and walks
          around it slowly. He peers inside. A tuft of paper pokes out
          from under the seat. He pulls the door handle, locked.
<b>

          waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head,
          ready to drop it through the window.
<b>          
</b>          He stops. His eyes catch something in the distance.
<b>          
</b>          The lanky shaved-head kid, whose name is Tugger.   Coming
          towards him fast.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall
          to the ground. He casually leans against the car, removes
          his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case
          in his pocket.
<b>          
</b>          Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the
          pavement. Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug, his face stiff. Tug
          turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth. Brendan falls
          to his knees.
<b>          
</b>          While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily.
          Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him
          back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth,
          three times. When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone,
          catching himself on his hands and knees. The car door slams.
<b>          
</b>          The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the
          parking lot, spins around and stops, facing Brendan. Its
          motor purrs deeply. Brendan begins to limp towards it
          doggedly, head up, eyes fixed.
<b>          
</b>          A crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang
          forward. It comes straight at Brendan, rumbling like a tank.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady.
          The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all.
<b>          
</b>          It speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the
          edge of his jacket. Brakes squeal behind him. Brendan turns
          and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away.
<b>          
</b>          He stops at the window.   Tugger eyes him curiously, with
          some respect.

                looks back up.

</b>                Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough
                to see which street signs pass by. Loud music plays from the
                car -- "Sweet Baby James" by James Taylor.1
<b>          
</b>                The car zooms on.

                an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head.
                Brendan closes the trunk.

</b>                A small one story house, slightly run down. Tugger opens the
                trunk and drags Brendan out, covering his eyes with a palm,
                slams the trunk and goes inside.

          of empty bottles, precarious piles of books. The overall
          impression though is not of jumbled chaos, but of a nest,
          comfortably woven and very worn in.

          small desk, writing under a green bookkeeper's lamp.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan is shoved into the center of the room. Tug and his
          clones slump against the surrounding walls. Brendan watches
          the thin figure's back. For a beat the only noise is the
          scratching of the thin man's pencil. Then he sighs and
          swivels around.
<b>          
</b>          Mid to late twenties. Sallow features, tired eyes. His
          clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out
          specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the
          neck down and eyebrows up.

          cotton dress, currently bent over the fridge mumbling.

          clatter on the cement. Brendan swings around a corner,
          doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost
          sight of him.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan sweats, listening. The lug's footsteps echo through
          the hallways, coming from all directions at once. Then it
          seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right.
          Brendan dashes left. Wrong. The lug looms over him, his
          knife hand flashing. Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open,
          and the white filling inside turns red. He stumbles back
          blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty
          feet on the lug before turning the corner.

</b><b>          
</b>          On his socked feet running silently back towards the corner.
          The lug's footsteps crash like symbols as they both come
          around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan slides like a baseball player, tangling his legs
          into the lug's. The lug pitches forward with frightening
          momentum. He hits the hall's metal handrail with his arms
          and head. A hollow gong reverberates through the hallway,
          and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut.
          A wallet with a couple of twenties and a student ID (CHUCK
          BURNS), three hash pipes, fifteen joints, a baggie of weed
          and a large brownie in another baggie.

                    The VP and I needed to ask you a few
                    questions about Emily Kostich, who you
                    might have heard is missing. It's a very
                    serious thing. The police are involved.
                    The VP and I knew you two were close, so
                    the VP and I came to ask you questions,
                    but you were truant. If you don't have a
                    valid excuse-

</b><b>          EXT. THE PIN'S HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          The bird of prey mailbox looms ominously. Brendan knocks on
          the front door. No answer. He presses lightly on the screen
          door, and it gives.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
</b><b>          
</b>          Empty. Brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens
          the narrow basement door. He descends into inky gloom.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
</b>          Deathly still and silent. Barely breathing, Brendan goes to
          the lit doorway at the end of the hall.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. PIN'S DEN - SAME
</b><b>          
</b>          Empty. Brendan floats through the room like a ghost, to the
          Pin's desk.
<b>          
</b>          Slowly, then with greater confidence he rifles through it -
          papers and trinkets, meaningless.
<b>          
</b>          He reaches beneath the desk, knocking it gently with his
          knuckles. Quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down
          into the desk frame.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches
          thick. He pulls out another. Another. Another. Thumbing the
          stacks -- pure hundreds.
<b>          
</b>          Something creaks in the hallway.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan freezes. Silently he replaces the money and drawer,
          his eyes on the doorway. He creeps towards the door on the
          balls of his feet.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
</b><b>          
</b>          Still empty. Brendan creeps towards the stairs, passing
          other doorways, all open but for one. He stops for a moment,
          listening - silence.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                         73

</b><b>          
</b>          Brendan enters the room - pitch black but for a small high
          window. Brendan pulls the curtains aside. A beam of sunlight
          spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark.
          Brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror
          jumps as well.
<b>          
</b>          A white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark
          room.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light,
          reflecting it around the room like a flashlight. More junk,
          a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white
          lump in it. The white bird stands behind the lump, its dark
          eyes caught in the bare light.
<b>          
</b>          The bird flies out the window.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan goes to the white lump, a small brick of white
          powder. White chalky residue patterns the floor -- there
          were other bricks there before.
<b>          
</b>          Behind Brendan, in the mirror, something moves. Someone
          else, in the room.
<b>          
</b>          Tugger. He throws Brendan across the room, then heaves him
          into a wall.

                    It disappeared. Someone skimmed it. We

          Tug blows past Brendan like a train and slams the Pin into
          the ground with his fist. He punctuates his words with hard
          straight blows into the Pin's face.

<b>          
</b>          He pulls the gun.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan shouts and throws himself on Tug's arm, wrenching it
          sideways. The gun clunks onto the carpet.
<b>          
</b>          The Pin flips Tug   over and for a moment Brendan is caught
          between them, hit   and torn, rolling over the gun. Tug grabs
          it, Brendan grabs   his wrist and the gun goes off, firing
          into the ceiling.   Plaster sprays.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan screams, thrashing wildly, and manages to slip out
          of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two.
<b>          
</b>          The Pin is on top, pinning Tug's gun hand to the carpet,
          straining to keep it there.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan leaps to his feet, staggers, then winds up and kicks
          Tug in the wrist with all his strength.
<b>          
</b>          A terrible crunching popping sound. Tug roars. Brendan takes
          the gun from his limp hand.

</b>          Brendan backs off a few steps. The Pin strains to keep Tug

</b>          Brendan stumbles back. Tug roars, flips the Pin over and
          beats his face mercilessly.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan stumbles out into the hall.
<b>          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME

</b>          Empty. From the darkened doorways and the thin ceiling
          relentless sounds of fighting.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan walks backwards as if in a trance, eyes glued to the
          Pin's door. Inside wild shadows splay across the walls, and
          the Pin shouts Brendan's name.
          Light flashes from another darkened doorway and the wall
          beside Brendan splinters. Brendan spins on his heel and
          fires three shots into the darkness, which falls silent.

</b>          He turns the gun back on the Pin's doorway.
<b>          
</b>          With a spray of sparks the doorway turns dark. They broke
          the lamp.
<b>          
</b>          The dark doorway looms up before Brendan, inky black.
          Horrible sounds come from it, blows, breaking bone, screams.
          The Pin screams Brendan's name over and over, calling for
          help. Pleading. Brendan steps back.
<b>          
</b>          Time slows down. Brendan drops the gun.
<b>          
</b>          It thunks on the carpet.
<b>          
</b>          In one motion Brendan kicks the gun down the hall into the
          Pin's doorway, turns and runs into the room where he found
          the brick.

</b>          Dark. Brendan runs through, clawing past dark fighting
          shapes, running like a man possessed. He breaks through the
          darkness and heaves himself up through the small window.

</b><b>          EXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

</b>          Brendan scrambles out, slips on the grass and hits the
          ground hard.
<b>          
</b>          Two sharp gunshots come from the house.
<b>          
</b>          Everything is suddenly still. Brendan stands slowly.
<b>          
</b>          He notices a light from the Mustang - the trunk has drifted
          open.
<b>          
</b>          Inside, a pale blue arm lies tangled in black plastic. Blue
          fingernails. Cheap plastic bracelets.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan shuts the trunk solidly, then walks off down the
          street and vanishes into the inky night.
<b>          
</b>          A moment later police cars pull up, sirens blaring, lights
          turning the dark streets bright as day.

</b>          Brendan stands crookedly, hands in pockets, eyes trained on
          the cold black horizon. A speck appears. Brendan waits for
          it, bracing himself against the wind.
<b>          
</b>          Laura. She puts her arms around him, a warm embrace. Brendan
          draws back.

</b><b>                              BRENDAN
</b>                    Alright, from the top. You had your
                    fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances
                    and to keep him buying from the Pin, who
                    you were hooked with. Emily came to you
                    and Brad, you saw her for what she was,
                    an insecure little girl trying to get
                    in. She goes on the backburner.
                    Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored,
                    maybe just greedy, so when the Pin
                    scores big with the bricks you take your
                    shot. You hook one, take half, and cut
                    it back to size, but you cut it bad.
                    Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the
                    Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put
                    it back, but poor Frisco doses off it
                    and lands in a coma.
                        (voice strengthening)
                    So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's
                    jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's
                    crowd looking for blood, or at least a
                    scape. You know trouble. There's going
                    to be a war over this. And there's
                    Emily. She trusts you. She wants in.
                    It's duck soup.

                    you cut her loose. You turn on your heel
                    and bite her in the throat. Last week on
                    the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she
                    saw something she was scared of. Tug's
                    car driving by, the Pin driving, but she
                    wouldn't have seen the Pin. No, she was
                    across the street, angel. She saw the
                    passenger side. She saw you. She saw you
                    and ran like she saw some devil.

</b><b>                              BRENDAN
</b>                    And she took the hit. Dode hid her away,
                    but the Pin was on to her, tracked her
                    down, told her to meet him, that they
                    would make good. Gave her a time, and a
                    place. And sent Tug. Just to get the
                    straight. But maybe you had talked Tug
                    up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em
                    sprung it on him that she had her kid,
                    and he did what anyone could count on
                    Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit
                    for you. You let her take it.

                    in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't
                    steal the brick last night. In your

</b>                    That's good. That means you didn't let
                    me walk into a slaughterhouse. You
                    didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their
                    crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman
                    reads the note, takes my cue and
                    searches your locker, he won't find a
                    damn thing.
<b>          
</b>          Something changes in Laura's eyes.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. LOCKER CAGE - INSERT
</b><b>          
</b>          Trueman and several other men force Laura's locker open.
          From its dark interior the chalky white brick falls out,
          spins through the air, and shatters silently on the locker
          cage floor.
<b>          
</b><b>          EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - SAME
</b><b>          
</b>          A moment of silence between them. The basketball nets
          jangle.
<b>          
</b>          Laura steps back. She looks as if she has been punched in
          the face.
<b>

                    It's done.
<b>          
</b>          Her face does strange things, subtle contortions.
          She watches his eyes. He doesn't look at her. Her voice
          shakes.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                        109

</b>                    Done. Well. That's most of it. 9 out of
                    10. I told Em to tell Tug it was his.
                    Told her it would soften him up. She
                    said she wished she could keep it, but
                    she didn't love the father. I was going
                    to drive her down the next day, we'd
                    found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was
                    starting to show. 3 months. You know
                    whose kid that makes it, or have you
                    known all along?
<b>          
</b>          Slowly, steadily, she straightens up. Her figure takes back
          some dignity. She steps towards him deliberately. Closer.
          Right up against him.
<b>          
</b>          She brings her head to his, puts her lips to his ear,
          breathes warm breath, and says two words. The first is
<b>          
</b>                                 LAURA (cont'd)
                    Mother-
<b>          
</b>          the second is low, guttural and lost to the whistling wind.
<b>          
</b>          She turns and walks briskly away.
<b>          
</b>          Brendan watches her go across the dark, barren field of
          asphalt.
<b>          
</b>          Metal jangles. Brendan turns to see the Brain hopping a
          chain link fence. Brendan turns his eyes back on Laura.
<b>

</b><b>                              THE BRAIN

                    knife guy. Spilled it all to the bulls,

</b>           Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field, watching

           off behind a twisted chain linked fence.
