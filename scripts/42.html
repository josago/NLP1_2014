          The big Birmingham Black Barons CATCHER behind the plate as
          Kansas City Monarchs JOHN SCOTT stands at bat. The catcher's
          attention on the RUNNER DANCING off first. Stomping a foot,
          feinting, hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights.

<b>                         CATCHER
</b>          Where'd you learn to move like

          night?! Stay quiet!
          INSERT: Birmingham, Alabama. April 8, 1945. 
          On the first pitch the runner takes off. The catcher fires to
          second. See it from his POV as the runner slides in â€œSAFE!â€�
          A foot on the bag, the runner dusts off, heckles the catcher:

<b>                         RUNNER
</b>          Is that the best you got?! Huh?!
          I'm going to steal nine, ten bases
          today! You better start counting!

          Shaking his head, the catcher gets back in his crouch,
          signals the PITCHER. On the wind-up, the Runner is off
          again. The catcher fires to THIRD: â€œSafe!â€�

</b>          Well California here he goes, if he
          comes down here.
          The Catcher gets back down in his squat. Signals the
          pitcher: fastball. Scott digs in, ready. The runner dancing
          off third. Here comes the wind-up...
          The Runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in. The
          Birmingham Catcher receives it. As the Runner slides --
          The Catcher intentionally drives his glove, the ball and both
          hands into the runner's face -- WHALLOP! Sound drops as
          we're knocked flat senseless along with the runner.
          ON HIM now as he tries to push himself up from the dirt. A
          close look at JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON. A born battler, he
          shakes out the cobwebs, finally lurches to his feet, looks to
          the UMPIRE. He never heard the call.

</b>          What was I?
          The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks
          over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes --
          The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back.
          As the two men wrestles each other to the ground --

          Blinds closed. Jack sits across the desk from Rickey.
          Sukeforth sits a little further back. Rickey is staring at
          Jack. Bushy eyebrows flared, light gleams off his glasses.

          away a lot. And Rae, Rachel, she
          wants to finish school. Considering

          What? Rickey stands, walks to a window. Jack looks at
          Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance.

<b>          RICKEY (CONT'D)
</b>          Baseball's a hard life; a man needs
          a good woman by his side. You
          don't want the only person waiting
          for you at home to be a catcher.
          Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on
          the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Coach Sukeforth here said you were
          starting a new Negro League. That
          doesn't make sense to me.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          This is about baseball.
          Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows
          it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal.

          Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day
          in time. This is all becoming a bit overwhelming.

          Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone. Jack sits there,

          Rickey looks back to Jack who is as angry as he is confused.

          not meet him on his own low ground.

</b>          He's fine with me, so long as you
          keep him up in Montreal.

</b>          Here comes the old man to save him.

          Jack directly toward Hopper. As Walker excuses himself...

          throwing the ball around and
          hitting a few. Why don't you toss
          a few with those fellas over there?

          2nd. Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly
          and catch it before it hits the ground.
          He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner
          out before he can get back to first. Â  Rickey is astounded.

          Rickey takes a moment to process. It's Hopper's light
          admonishing tone that really halts him. Finally...

          practically nursed race prejudice
          at your mother's breast, so I will
          let it pass. But I will add this:
          you can manage Robinson fairly and
          correctly or you can be unemployed.

          spend in Daytona. But still, when
          this fine young Negro man steps on
          that field today, he and the
          Dodgers will technically be
          breaking the law. A law which says
          white and black players cannot
          enjoy the same field at the same
          time. Does that make sense to you?
          Does Jim Crow make any sense when
          placed against the words of the
          United States Constitution? When
          placed against the word of God?
          POP OUT to reveal he sits beside the DODGER BATBOY, so short
          his feet don't touch the ground. Rickey offers his peanut
          bag. As the batboy takes one...

          You knew he was fast; but not this fast. Bragan's throw to 
          Pee Wee is late and high. Pee Wee throws back to Higbe. 
          Higbe sets. Bragan gives him a sign. Jack takes a lead. On

          Bragan fires to third and Jack is caught in a RUN DOWN. It

          He throws over. Jack back to the bag. Higbe gets the ball
          back, looks in. Jack bouncing, pounding off third. His 
          movements carry violence within them. Like a piston 
          exploding in an engine. 
          Higbe into his motion, stops his delivery, accidentally drops 
          the ball to the ground. The umpire signals BALK, points Jack
          home. Higbe is furious.

          for second. The second baseman has to wait on the throw and

</b>          Recently, the thought has occurred
          to me that a change of ball clubs
          would benefit both the Brooklyn
          Baseball Club and myself.

<b>                         (TO WALKER)

</b>          I'm keeping my reasons private.
          Hope you can respect that, sir.

<b>                         RICKEY
</b>          I realize, Dixie, that you have a
          Southern upbringing, that you would
          have to subordinate your feelings
          for the welfare of this venture. I
          for one would deeply appreciate it.
          I think we can all learn something.

<b>                         WALKER
</b>          What I have, Mr. Rickey, is a
          hardware store back home. It's
          called Dixie Walker's. Folks don't
          come because I have the lowest
          prices, they come because it's
          called Dixie Walker's. Understand?
          And I make as much money owning
          that store as I do playing for you.

          Bragan's a third-stringer, but you
          bat clean-up. You're popular in
          Brooklyn. Children look up to you!

          get value in return. Until then I
          expect you to drive in runs.

</b>          I love this game. I love baseball.
          I've given my life to it. Forty
          odd years ago I was a player coach
          at Ohio Wesleyan University. We
          had a Negro catcher, best hitter on
          the team. Charley Thomas.

</b>          A fine young man. I saw him laid
          low. Broken because of the color
          of his skin and I didn't do enough
          to help. I told myself I did, but
          I didn't. The game I loved had
          something unfair at the heart of
          it. I ignored it. But a time came
