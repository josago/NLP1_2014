               Quick cuts, seductive angles: 70 hot-air balloons rise over 
               a vast, green corporate campus. Their mylar skins are 
               imprinted with Outpost '98 logos; their gondolas are dressed

               18,000 Outpost employees cheer. They're spread out over

               hero is partly visible through a glass panel in the door: 
               Gary (in a suit and tie) has an open American face. But

               We're in an old (empty) Craftsman house. Through a front

</b>                         ...The corporate condos were as 
                         romantic as they sound.

               Milo's grinning as he takes in the house.

               Windows give onto a garden with a small studio. Milo's still 
               beaming, Alice is pleased. Till he says:

               2.) GARY sits with MILO at his desk, discussing code. Pan to 
               the window; we see a different pair of awed Geeks.

               3.) Milo & Alice read in bed. He's reading Gary's book.

               4.) MILO shows GARY one of his early programs, written on 
               1.0.: it's simple-looking, with some childish writing scrawled 
               on it. Gary seems touched.

<b>               INT. OUTPOST CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Two DOJ AGENTS depose Gary. (A video-cam records his answers.) 
               Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is 
               reading from a document:

<b>                                     DOJ AGENT
</b>                         "Infotek's urgent need to license 
                         Outpost Office is such that we can 
                         use it as a tool in the current 
                         negotiation."
                              (looks up)
                         When you wrote the word "tool," what'd 
                         you mean by it?

               Gary studies his copy of the E-mail. He looks vexed.

                         speculate under oath?

               The Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's 
               negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable, 
               while offering nothing).

                         remember."

               The Agents confer. Gary sees Phil, looming outside the open 
               door. One of the Agents sees him, too. He doesn't try to 
               hide his annoyance:

               Gary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it.

               Gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code.

                         systems, Milo, they --

               Catching himself, Gary trails off. He sits down, exhales.

                         you can never control is somebody's 
                         creative process.

               Gary seems sincerely contrite. (He needn't be: Milo just 
               wants to please him. Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop 
               obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire," 
               engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more 
               engrossing than Skywire?)

                         different approach.

               Reading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow.

               This seems to jolt her. She pales a little. What a mysterious 
               girl. But this only adds to her allure.

                         be like computers. Least they make 
                         sense. Sometimes you think they've 
                         betrayed you. Like a person would. 
                         But then you see, no, you just missed

               This strikes a deep chord with Milo, all of it.

               They sit. As she inserts the disk, he finds himself looking 
               at her. On the screen, the frontier outpost we know as the 
               logo appears. It's struck by a bolt from the sky. The outpost 
               comes alive with light, music, movie-images through its

               indecipherable, but we discern an enraged "bullshit!" Milo

               peers at the painted-over epithet on the wall.

               Nelson shows Milo a San Jose Mercury: mugshots of two skin-
               headed Aryan Nations Members in their 20's.

                         the weapon with Teddy's blood on it

                         How come they weren't in jail?

               Milo unpins a picture of himself & Teddy from a board.

                         do you? That's not on a hard drive?

               Milo is stung by this. Alice appears in the doorway.

                         time to go to scatter the ashes.

               Milo is pinning the picture back up. The pushpin falls to 
               the floor, he kneels to retrieve it. On the floorboards, he 
               sees a thin, shiny plastic filament. He picks it up.

               But when he looks up, Nelson's gone.

               As he heads out with Alice, he unthinkingly stuffs the

                         'Just came out that way.

               Seeing Gary's code, Milo knits his brow: it must be sort of 
               like -- Teddy's.

</b>                         Been thinking about the push mechanism 
                         in the handler. And it came over me: 
                         it's in the wrong place.

</b>                              (an uncertain smile)
                         The wrong place?

</b>                         The answer's not in the box. It's in 
                         the band.

               Milo's smile freezes. As he stares at Gary, we zoom with a 
               reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but 
               Gary remains dominant in frame. For Milo, it feels like the 
               very ground is going out from under him.

               Gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code. And 
               Milo pretends to listen. But he can't even make out the words 
               Gary speaks -- he hears only a jumble of echoes.

               Milo nods mechanically; he wants to scream. Or run. He 
               perceives, amid the echoes, that Gary is standing, smiling, 
               saying "See you later." And he's gone.

               Milo touches the pages, like some talisman of Teddy.

               Pulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone. He hits 
               HOME on the speed-dial. Gets a busy signal. Rings off. He's 
               about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded 
               on the receiver.

               He moves into the bedroom. He sees her through the window, 
               painting in the studio.

               He stands outside the studio. Waits for her to look up. She 
               does. She smiles. Then she sees something's wrong. He waits 
               for her to come out here, where it's safe to speak.

               there. Alice comes up behind him. He finds his suit jacket. 
               He digs in one pocket, then another. He finds the fiber optic

               Milo sits. Shrot goes out with the Guard.

               Milo moves quickly to the wall, reads a chart with the Guards' 
               Schedule, runs his finger down it til he finds the name of 
               the Guard on the 3 AM shift: DELBERT, KEN.

               Milo has moved to Shrot's seat. He's encoding a fresh card 
               with Ken Delbert's information.

               Panning off the civil defense sign we find Shrot standing at 
               a closet, examining a piece of the alarm clock.

<b>               INT. PHYSICAL SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Milo is at work, bringing up schematic screens, diagnosing 
               the system with his unique concentration.

               Panning to the window, we see the evacuated Programmers 
               enjoying themselves on the lawn. It's a rare, exciting event: 
               they jump around, miming explosions.

               Shrot and the Guard collect pieces of the bomb out of the

</b>
               Milo brings up the screen that controls the #21 cameras. On 
               the monitors, he sees nothing very interesting: a hallway, a 
               room under construction...

               He pulls down a menu. RECORDING is highlighted. He clicks 
               PLAYBACK. The image hardly changes, but a Guard wanders 
               through. He types, the tape rewinds (the Guard moves 
               backwards). He finds a neutral spot (showing an empty 
               hallway), stops the tape.

                         think.

               Gary strides off. Shrot feels unfairly maligned.

</b>                         You're not listening.

               Randy and Phil head up the hall. Shrot watches them. Even if 
               his "intellectual superiors" are convinced of Milo's 
               innocence, he isn't.

               He walks swiftly back toward his office. Then he runs.

               They've let the Programmers back in. They head up the hall 
               as Shrot heads down it. He pushes past them gruffly.

               He knows he's enhancing his Neanderthal image (they make 
               cracks) but he's more interested in obeying his instinct.

               Shrot is back, he has only to round the corner to see Milo. 
               We assume his POV as he does so:

               Milo sits in the chair where Shrot left him.

               Pan off the clock (3:20 AM) to find Milo at his desk, looking 
               at the clock with a certain dread. It's time.

               Milo walks the path between the two buildings, fiddling 
               nervously with the dummied swipe card.

               Hearing footfalls behind him, he whirls: it's a Geek loping 
               to his car. He smiles. Milo smiles: waits, walks on.

               Nearing #21, Milo looks around, making sure no one else is 
               around. His POV (panning): A Programmer works late, visible 
               through a lighted window in #20... The dog sculpture with 
               cocked ears sits atop the Day Care, its quizzical expression 
               seeming to wonder what Milo is up to... The Geek he just saw 
               racing by on foot now pulls out of the parking lot in his 
               James Bond BMW...

               Milo arrives at the entrance. Heart pounding, he brings the 
               card to the slot. Will he trigger that awful alarm?

               He slides the card, the door clicks.

               Milo moves up a hall with unpainted walls, bare floors, 
               unconnected wires. The only illumination is from construction 
               lights on the concrete floor. Opening doors, he sees:

               Bare rooms. Wall plates ready to receive electrical equipment, 
               bundles of wire hanging out. In other words: the building is 
               as advertised, so far.

               Delbert comes out with his flashlight, heads across the clean-
               swept path that leads to #21.

<b>               INT. BLDG. 21 - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Milo nears a set of double-doors at the end of the hall. He 
               hears a low ominous hum from within. Convinced he's found 
               something, he quickens his pace. He's about to swipe his 
               card when a beam of light bounces along the wall.

               He presses himself into an alcove. Through a chink in the 
               unfinished wall he sees:

               Delbert come in the front door. His rounds consist of shining 
               his torch up at the cameras, making sure the red lights are 
               on.

               He walks right past Milo (who doesn't breath).

               Delbert swipes open the double doors, leans in: the humming 
               gets louder.

               ON MILO: pressing himself into the alcove.

               Delbert turns around, heads back down the hall... exits the 
               building.

               Milo waits a beat before heading to the end of the hall. 
               Using the card, he enters

               A studio-to-be, architectural touches like soffits framed in 
               but not plaster-boarded. The portentous hum comes from around 
               a corner. He approaches, convinced the answer lies here. 
               Clearing the wall he sees:

               A squat emergency generator sitting on the floor, powering 
               construction lights. Something you'd buy at Sears.

               in the foreground (dog sculpture) as we track him.

               Milo sags onto the bench. He stares out, perplexed, suffering. 
               Then he knits his brow. He seems to be studying -- the ground.

               Or rather the shadow stretched out in front of him: the 
               looming silhouette of the dog atop the Day Care.

               He stands up, turns around. REVERSE ON:

               The whimsical canine. Push toward it's ears cocked to the 
               sky... Then toward a single ear, framed by fur-brown concrete, 
               but with a smooth, concave inner surface of enamelled metal:

</b>
               He steps in on colorful carpeting, amid balls & tricycles. 
               Kid's artwork hangs on the wall. He moves through this room, 
               into the

<b>               COMPUTER ROOM
</b>
               20 screens glow. They hang suspended over a wide, ringed 
               table, a chair at each keyboard. Indeed, Gary has spared no 
               expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital 
               screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour 
               drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship). 
               There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of 
               the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming).

               Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. 
               Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings 
               are of desks or tables with computers.

               Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a 
               workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant 
               at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- familiar. 
               Milo passes it. And comes back to it.

               Staring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing still 
               occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the 
               bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously -- 
               numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do is 
               a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, his 
               frustration evident.

               As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the 
               screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolve 
               into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in 
               Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now).

               When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CLICK 
               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the 
               screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. All 
               of them show variations on a theme:

               A workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a 
               programmer (if he were present). The stations are of various 
               shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed 
               view of screen & keyboard. At this hour, few programmers are 
               present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. A 
               Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there.

               Milo works the keyboard. Again, the code gets dense and 
               obscure as he goes deeper. He succeeds in calling-up a 
               graphical interface. Among the menus he can choose from are: 
<b>               TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS.
</b>
               He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal 
               Tech, etc.). He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy. Two windows 
               open. In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an

               In the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handheld 
               crime-scene video (marked SV-PD) of a ransacked grocery store. 
               "DIE GOOK!" is painted on a wall. Milo looks confused: some 
               "narrative" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without 
               audio.

               He types some more.

               In the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regarding 
               the audio. About the only phrases we can understand are: 
               "Audio Block ON" and "Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filter 
               Type PBX-R17."

               His eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware 
               substitute. He digs in his shirt pocket. He takes out his 
               swipe card, studies it. He casts about some more, till he 
               sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar.

               Randy whistles as he heads up the hall. Arriving at the door 
               with the Civil Defense sticker, he swipes his card.

<b>               INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               On-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Aryan 
               Nations suspects come out of it. A still photo appears in 
               the 2nd window: a steel hasp.

               Milo's eyes are narrowed: what am I seeing? Meantime, he is 
               reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from 
               the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within.

               He has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its 
               magnetic strip into a metal slot. He wiggles the card. We 
               hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice of 
               a serene, eminently sane female:

               Crime-scene video streams in now stenciled FBI by the 
               time/date). A handheld camera pans a blood-spattered wall 
               then shows a mutilated Asian murder victim. (All of this 
               footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always 
               present in streaming video, and its sinister graininess.)

                         of torture, which is typical.

               Milo pales as he realizes he is watching a primer on how 
               racial killings are done.

               He hears a creaking noise behind him, and whirls.

               It's the classroom hamster, on his wheel.

               Milo has tapped into his own file: footage of him lecturing 
               at Stanford (as an RA), pointing to a whiteboard.

                         he went truant from classes to attend 
                         Comix Conventions.

               The audio crackles and drops out again. Milo's eyes narrow: 
               he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speaking 
               to someone. She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro.

               What's he seeing? He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware almost 
               urgently, till the narration crackles back on:

</b>
               He hears her voice under the Narration, answering an unseen 
               Interrogator (sounds like Phil). It's a job interview. Milo 
               subtly, unconsciously shakes his head, as if to deny what 
               his eyes see. The narration begins to fibrillate, again:

                         with the socially maladroit Milo --

               The audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files and 
               ER photos of himself marked STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER: he's 
               waxen, bloated, gasping for breath. With a certain dread, 
               Milo jams the card in deeper:

                         since she would quote "save his life."

               Milo is devastated, disbelieving. Now he sees real-time ER 
               footage: an Allergy Victim, bloated, twitching, gasping, 
               dying...

               The audio crackles out. But Milo doesn't have the heart to 
               bring it back: he can fill in the rest.

               Numb now, Milo clicks randomly: crime footage, personal 
               records, animations -- it all flies by with Chuck Worman-
               like speed.

               Milo closes his eyes, leans back: overwhelmed. Suddenly he 
               sits forward, whispers almost fervently as he types:

               toward a windowed door at the back of the room.

               RANDY appears in the window, lit ominously from below. He 
               applies his swipe card.

               In one window, footage of Lisa casing the hallway before

               window, a grade-school yearbook photo of Lisa.

                         kill her should she tell anyone.

               Milo watches streaming local news footage of a man being 
               taken from a courtroom in shackles (jerky, grainy). He's 
               lost the audio, but doesn't need it, anymore.

               slashed.

               But then, hearing nearly-distant whistling, he clicks on

<b>               COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               The screens show the children's contour images, again. Where's 
               Milo?

               Randy takes a seat at the same console Milo was at, and begins 
               to type. Camera booms slowly down beneath table-level to 
               find:

               MILO hanging onto the underside of the table, knuckles white, 
               as he clings to metal table braces. The toes of his sneakers 
               are jammed into the space between a black plastic data tower 
               and the table bottom.

               Randy shifts in his seat, his knee rising toward Milo's back. 
               Milo arches it, avoids a knee by mere millimeters.

               RANDY: brings up a shot of a Programmer at work, zooms in on 
               his screen to begin collecting his code.

               MILO: begins to lose his grip as sweat forms on his brow 
               and, worse, on his hands. They're giving way.

               RANDY: clicks. A printer across the room start making a hard-
               copy of the purloined code.

               MILO: stares in horror as the data tower his toes are jammed 
               on top of starts to shift -- threatening to disengage from 
               its ports. He tries to lift it back up with heels of his 
               shoes.

               RANDY: knits his brow as his screen flickers. He keeps typing, 
               but starts to lower his head: he's going to look under the 
               table.

               MILO: winces as he presses the tower upward with his heels, 
               while trying to maintain his balance...

               RANDY: lowering his head, keeps his eyes on the screen, hits 
               keys. Just as he is about to clear the level of the table -- 
               the screen re-illumines. He comes back up.

               MILO: having extended his legs to support the tower, feels 
               his hands slipping...

               RANDY: closes up the window...

               MILO: flops to the carpet(!) just as --

               RANDY pushes away from the table... From the floor

               MILO watches him walk over to the printer, collect his 
               hardcopy, and disappear from view.

               Milo listens: the door clicks shut, the whistling recedes.

<b>               BACK ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

               Milo traces Randy's steps. He sees the door with the Civil 
               Defense sticker, intuits how Randy got here, i.e, how one 
               moves, unobserved, between the Day Care and #20.

               holding a container of coffee, discussing the particulars of

               photos on the wall. He takes comfort in their solidity: 
               pictures of Barton's teenage Kids, Barton and Wife at the 
               Grand Canyon. There's a college football photo, a young Barton

               She sits by him, touches her hand to his face tenderly. He 
               closes his eyes for a moment, steels himself to her touch. 
               Then he forces himself to cup his hand over hers.

               But he can't stand it. He gets up, looks out the window.

                         grief. Help them find Teddy's killers.

               He doesn't see her smile: is that all. Assuming an 
               appropriately concerned expression, she moves toward him:

               She turns him around, kisses him. Her eyes are closed. His 
               remain open. He's looking at her. Trying to comprehend the 
               treachery.

               She touches him, breathes heavily. She wants more than kisses: 
               to prove to herself how wrong Phil was, her professional 
               pride insulted. Or perhaps it's more personal than that, 
               especially with Lisa as a potential rival.

               But she doesn't stop. She moans as she presses herself to 
               him: wants proof of his devotion.

               He's on top of her in the moment just after. Her eyes are 
               closed. He stares at her -- glares at her -- with what we 
               recognize as spent anger.

               What's clear is, she liked it. A clap of thunder takes us 
               to:

               It's pouring. Milo stands outside, wearing a slicker, looking 
               in the window at someone.

               Lisa reads a paperback at a table, a slice of pizza on her 
               plate, an umbrella hooked to her chair. Sensing someone 
               standing over her, she looks up. She smiles.

               Close on a satellite dish. We pan from the base of the dish 
               to the wiring: a cable is fused to a component box.

               Lisa is on the scaffolding, having climbed it brazenly, in 
               broad daylight. She holds a small metal box with a meter and 
               two clamps. She applies the clamps to the base of the cable. 
               The needle on the meter dances.

               He points to a door immediately behind him. As the Houseman 
               watches, Milo goes into the

<b>               BATHROOM
</b>
               He stands there a moment, breathes deeply. He cracks open 
               the door. The Houseman is turning away another Guest; Milo 
               makes his move.

<b>               DEN-LIKE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Looking over his shoulder, Milo hurries to a door at the far 
               end of the room, silently cursing the Mondrian that inevitably 
               appears.

               The Houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom 
               door, assumes Milo's still inside.

</b>
               Milo walks fast. As he passes from one room to next, he sees 
               a Mondrian: he's been in this room. All the austere, 
               tastefully decorated rooms are blending together.

               He stands in the center of the room making quarter turns. 
               Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly-
               appointed "den," the ultimate expression of bland, rich, 
               professionally-decorated taste.

               He's lost.

               He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another.

<b>               INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               The Houseman looks over his shoulder again. He sees the 
               Mondrian and, in the room beyond that, another Mondrian.

               He moves to the bathroom door, knocks on it. Opens it. He 
               pulls a sleek walkie-talkie from his jacket.

<b>               INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Milo, still lost, is getting frantic. He doubles back, cuts 
               toward another wing of the house. Through an open doorway he 
               sees:

               A young, chillingly calm NANNY, watching him. The Baby fusses 
               in her arms. Milo smiles, keeps moving.

<b>               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               A Second Houseman follows the trail of Mondrians. He sees 
               Mondrians in two different directions. He hesitates, picks a 
               direction, keeps moving.

<b>               INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               The first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary.

<b>               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Milo has finally made it. Sitting at Gary's work station, he 
               slips a CD-ROM into the PC. It floods with text. The music 
               echoes from far off. The entire wall behind him is filled 
               with a Mondrian.

<b>               INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               As Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary, 
               whispers in his ear. We see Gary smile, excuse himself. He 
               and Alice share a look as he moves off.

               We go with Gary. His smiles fades instantly. He pushes through 
               Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant "do;" he 
               hardly hears them.

<b>               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Milo writes frantically on his tiny pad, copying from the PC 
               screen:

               LONGITUDE - 77 Degrees 03 Minutes 58 Seconds East

               LATITUDE - 38 Degrees 55 Minutes 14 Seconds South

<b>               ALTITUDE - 426 MILES

               He flips the page, begins entering the fixes for the next 
               satellite. Thinking he's heard something, he looks up.

               Nobody's there.

<b>               INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               The Second Houseman turns in several directions, confused by 
               the trail of Mondrians. Passing into the next room, he runs 
               into a Third Houseman, also confused. Each follows a different 
               Mondrian, in a different room.

<b>               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Unlike the Housemen, Gary doesn't follow the paintings. He 
               moves swiftly, seems to know where Milo is.

<b>               GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Milo still working...

<b>               PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Alice looks up at the digital painting: still a Bosch. Her 
               face sets grimly.

<b>               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Milo clicks, closing the window. Concentrating, he doesn't 
               see what we see on the wall behind him: the Mondrian drains 
               away... And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch triptych.

               After a moment, Milo senses something.

               Gary stands in the doorway. Watching him. Milo doesn't 
               breathe. Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's.

               Gary comes behind Milo. He reads the screen. It's filled 
               with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down.

<b>                                     GARY

                         "Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working 
                         with you. I'd be lying if I didn't

                              (he looks up)
                         You left my party to send E-mail?

                         reasons.

               Gary stares at Milo. He looks skeptical. The party music 
               floats in from afar as the moment stretches.

                         Is there?

</b>                         You see what's hanging on the wall?

               He looks over. Milo looks over. Among the framed 
               commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood 
               program, written on Outpost 1.0. Gary has had it framed.

               Milo absorbs it. Even now, he feels something for Gary.

<b>                                     GARY
</b>                         I hope you know what you mean to me. 
                         Not just because of what you're doing. 
                         Because of who you are.

<b>                                     MILO
</b>                         I do know, Gary. I feel the same 
                         way. I thought I was coming here for 
                         a job. But it's meant a lot more.

               Milo smiles almost tenderly. He doesn't know if Gary buys 
               it. Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes. But they're obscured 
               by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses.

               Gary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with the 
               art books, vaguely looks through one.

</b>                         When will you have a Beta version?

               Milo wonders: does he know? He picks his words carefully.

<b>                                     MILO
</b>                         I'm pretty close. But when I wrote 
                         the last contact switches, it wiped 
                         out a piece of the content filer. 
                         You know what it's like, writing 
                         software.

</b>                         I do know. You focus on the big 
                         problem. But somewhere down the chain, 
                         something breaks down. Something 
                         gets destroyed. At first it's 
                         upsetting. You feel you've lost 
                         control.

               Gary puts down the book. Something in his tone draws Milo.

</b>                         So you have to remind yourself: it's 
                         just the process. Something's always 
                         lost along the way to anything 
                         worthwhile. Some little bug, some 
                         glitch. 'Can't get bogged down in 
                         that, you're doing something other 
                         people could never do. They lack the 
                         imagination, the brain, the nerve. 
                         Let them fret about every unforeseen 
                         consequence. You have to solve the 
                         problem. That's who you are.

               Is this a confession? A plea for understanding? Or just a 
               pep-talk to keep Milo focused on Skywire?

               As Milo comes up the path, he sees Alice in the kitchen.

               He opens the front door, steps in. She comes from the kitchen 
               in an apron, wiping her hands. The apron is spattered, her 
               hair is askew.

                         eat in Chinese restaurants. I've 
                         been mincing things into teeny-tiny 
                         pieces all afternoon.

               He smiles to hide his terror. Is she killing him now? Or 
               just testing his reaction? Or is it a sincere overture?

</b>
               Milo, at the stove, sniffs at the food that simmers in a 
               wok. He grabs a a spoon, examines it; but it's minced too 
               fine to discern one ingredient from another.

               Alice pulls her hair back with a ribbon...

               Milo paces. He stops when she comes from the bedroom.

               Either she's the most cold-blooded woman in the world, or...

               He takes her in his arms, kisses her long and hard -- as if 
               his life depended on it. When he releases her, she pretends 
               to swoon. She backs toward the kitchen.

</b>
               Camera is positioned on the counter, just behind the big 
               bowl as Alice spoons the food into it... She sprinkles on 
               some final ingredient, also minced.

<b>               DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo's fingers drum the table top...

<b>               KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Alice picks up the dish. We don't see her face.

<b>               ON THE DISH - MOVING - CONTINUOUS (ALICE'S POV)
</b>
               We hold the dish out in front of us. The food shines in the 
               light, a poisonous yellow gleam. We move from kitchen to 
               dining room, slowly, deliberately...

               Milo comes into view beyond the dish, wearing a forced smile. 
               We come all the way to the table with the dish, where Alice 
               sets it down.

               She sits. Milo, still vamping, pours wine. He picks up his 
               fork. Stares at it.

<b>                                     ALICE

               His mind churns furiously.

</b>                         Oh, right. Hold on.

               When she's gone, he flips his left arm over and drags the 
               tines of his fork against it, making score-marks, like those 
               used by allergists to test for sensitivity.

               He dabs the sauce onto the tracks, wipes it clean. He stares 
               at it.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN DRAWER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
               Alice roots through ladles, bottle openers, cheese graters, 
               spatulas. At the bottom of the drawer, she finds two pairs 
               of take-out chopsticks, wrapped in white paper.

<b>               INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Milo looks from his watch to his arm -- no reaction yet.

               But here's Alice. She slips into her seat.

</b>                         You're just afraid to eat it.

               She smiles, picks up her glass.

               They toast. She sips her wine. He sips his. He wants 
               desperately to glance at his inner arm once more. But she's 
               watching him, waiting for him to eat.

               He picks up the chopsticks, gathers up a tiny bite. She 
               watches keenly. He brings the food to his mouth, passes it 
               between his lips, swallows.

               He closes his eyes, ostensibly to savor the food, in fact 
               bracing for a paroxysm.

               She watches him expectantly -- either for his verdict on the 
               food, or for the first fatal spasm.

<b>                                     MILO

                         It's great. It's great.

               She grins. She takes a bite. The moment she looks away, he 
               turns over his arm to get a look, face full of fear.

               The tracks are still flat, there's no redness. He shovels a 
               large bite into his mouth, ecstatic to be alive. Then another 
               bite, greedy with life.

               keyboard; Milo's name is printed under it.

               In a second window, other fingerprints flash by: thousands 
               of prints lifted off keyboards in the Day Care.

               Milo scrolls his Skywire code, concentrating intensely. Till

               rubs them together, peers at his keys.

               Dolly-zoom in on a trace of fingerprint powder.

               Fear seizes Milo. He ejects his the Skywire CD -- it is a 
               bright silver color, with a Skywire logo on it -- slips it 
               in an equally distinct silver (CD) jewel-case.

               In one window, college video of a promising Programmer, in

               3. The cuts accelerate. In a NETWORK CONTROL ROOM, Technicians 
               flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming. 
               At the NIKKEI, the Brokers are transfixed by what comes over 
               the Big Board. In a VEGAS CASINO Gamblers sip their drinks 
               as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors. On a 
               STREET CORNER, a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper. At a 
               STADIUM, the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vision 
               behind them plays Milo's broadcast. In an ELECTRONICS STORE, 
               a wall of TV's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer footage 
               for Shoppers. A guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost 
               '98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf... In the Day 
               Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy 
               moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magnetic

</b>                         Larry, Lisa.

               Larry switches off the TV as he comes to his feet. A Mover 
               passes by, hauling out a monitor. Larry explains:

</b>                         Your app kind of blew mine out of 
                         the water.

</b>                              (he shrugs)
                         We'll come up with the next big thing.

</b>                         ...You wanna work -- here?

<b>                                     MILO
</b>                         Got out of my other commitment.

               Larry hugs Milo. Turns to Lisa:

<b>                                     LARRY
</b>                         May I?

               He hugs Lisa, too. A Mover grabs Milo's backpack from the 
               floor.

<b>                                     MILO
</b>                         Hey, wait!
                              (when the Mover looks)
                         Not giving everything away.

               The Mover sets it down, moves on.

</b>                         C'mon. Bring your stuff.

               Milo grabs up his pack, the three of them head away from 
               camera.

<b>                                     LARRY
</b>                         You guys'll be using Teddy's old 
                         space, is that okay?

<b>                                     MILO
</b>                         Cool.

<b>                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

<b>                                         THE END
</b>
