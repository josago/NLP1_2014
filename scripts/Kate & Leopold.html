<b>               INT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY
</b>
               CLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15.

               The credits begin to roll.

               Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in 
               preparation for a formal reception.

               Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier.

               Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery.

               Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases.

<b>               INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
               Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.

               Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.

               Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with 
               decorative garnish.

               Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting 
               enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, 
               pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and 
               flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, 
               sour look.

               The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared 
               silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.

<b>               INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
               Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet 
               throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing 
               a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The 
               valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.

               The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.

               Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, 
               selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From 
               beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A 
               weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.

<b>               EXT. ESTATE - DAY
</b>
               The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a 
               dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, 
               he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He 
               sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.

               In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the 
               estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY - EVENING
</b>
               Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly 
               scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. 
               Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling 
               the staff to clean up the mess.

<b>               SERIES OF CLOSE UPS
</b>
               Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.

               A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.

               Hot water is poured into a bath.

               Carriages begin to arrive.

               Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.

               Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.

<b>               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.

               He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat 
               of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens 
               a corset around his mid-section from behind.

               Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.

               He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver 
               saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch 
               himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.

               He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet 
               sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold 
               thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and 
               saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.

               Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his 
               hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.

<b>               CLOSE UP
</b>
               Fine linen undervest slides over his head.

               Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.

               The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.

               A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.

               A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.

               An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails 
               to the knees is fitted to his torso.

               His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.

               His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.

               His cheeks are pinched.

               A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.

               Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He 
               raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a 
               waffle:

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         You dance like a herd of cattle, 
                         Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman 
                         who lights up the room... simply by 
                         leaving it.

               He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, 
               a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold 
               in the looking glass.

<b>                                     UNCLE OTTO
</b>                         Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join 
                         us downstairs after completing this 
                         one-sided flash of wit?

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle 
                         Otto. No one really listens to anyone 
                         else. If you attempt it, you will 
                         see why.

<b>                                     UNCLE OTTO
</b>                         You judge everything too severely. I 
                         wonder what would happen if you were 
                         to cast that critical eye inward?

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         You do not wonder at all. You merely 
                         ask in order to state your own 
                         opinion.

<b>                                     UNCLE OTTO
</b>                         We are all concerned about you.

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         Ahh, here it comes.

<b>                                     UNCLE OTTO
</b>                         Your life does not seem to have any 
                         direction. At the age of 25 a man is 
                         too young to do anything well. At 35 
                         he is too old. Now is your time to 
                         take action. Tell me, what is it you 
                         want to DO with your life?

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                              (wearily)
                         I do not know.

<b>                                     UNCLE OTTO
</b>                              (just as weary)
                         Your ignorance cramps my conversation.
                              (he slaps Leopold's 
                              face twice rather 
                              quickly)
                         Wake up! This is your one and only 
                         life. Every man has the chance to 
                         make a difference. DO something!

               Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         I am most grateful for your 
                         surveillance and for your sympathy. 
                         I assure you there is no need for 
                         concern. I am as effectual and 
                         attentive... as my position allows.

<b>                                     UNCLE OTTO
</b>                         Life is not position, Leopold. It is 
                         action.
                              (he straightens 
                              Leopold's tie)
                         I will see you downstairs promptly. 
                         In the appropriate frame of mind.

               He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. 
               The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. 
               Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.

               Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He 
               hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...

<b>                                     THE VALET
</b>                              (grandly)
                         Go spread joy.

               Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.

<b>               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian 
               society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance 
               card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is 
               MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting 
               God.

<b>               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>
               A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically 
               into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly 
               SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.

               Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing 
               suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out 
               of frame.

<b>               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>
               Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of 
               19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away 
               shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows 
               into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams 
               up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky 
               teeth.

               Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.

<b>               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>
               Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of 
               immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he 
               maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except 
               her enormous bosom.

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         You dance like an angel, Miss 
                         Fairchild. You light up the room. I 
                         thank you.

               Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card, 
               sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.

               He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She 
               scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. 
               Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         Good evening. I do not believe I 
                         have had the pleasure.

               The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes 
               he is addressing her. She puts her pad away.

<b>                                     CARLSON
</b>                         ...Julia Carlson.

               Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.

<b>                                     CARLSON
</b>                         I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                              (slightly tipsy)
                         You are not from the area, are you?

<b>                                     CARLSON
</b>                              (smiles and shakes 
                              her head "No")
                         Are you?

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         This is my estate.

<b>                                     CARLSON
</b>                         Really?
                              (looking around the 
                              room)
                         Well it's not home but it's much...

               Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There 
               is a hubbub amongst the guests.

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.

<b>                                     CARLSON
</b>                         The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't 
                         it?

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         It is a scandal nonetheless.

               Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         Miss Carlson, do me the honor?

<b>                                     CARLSON
</b>                         I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                              (smiling seductively)
                         Truly I would be in your debt. Any 
                         admonition would be erased simply by 
                         presenting a partner as lovely as 
                         yourself.

<b>                                     CARLSON
</b>                         No, no. Really, I...

               Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, 
               takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor.

               They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "TA-RA-RA-
               BOOM-DE-AY." Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, 
               shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.

<b>                                     LEOPOLD
</b>                         I suppose we really ought to sing 
                         along.

<b>                                     CARLSON
</b>                              (embarrassed)
                         Oh, golly.

               They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their 
               emphasis on "BOOM." Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes 
               freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:

<b>                                     CARLSON
</b>                              (breathless)
                         Thank you for the dance. It was

               Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He 
               watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard 
               door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her.

</b>
               Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the 
               dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes 
               back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She 
               is once again writing in her notebook.

               Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. 
               Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, 
               MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting 
               a weird glow.

               Leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside.

               She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away, 
               accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls 
               from the machine.

               The compartment door slides OPEN revealing DR. KAU, 30's, an 
               Asian doctor with a THICK BROOKLYN ACCENT. Her face full of 
               enthusiasm drops as she sees the unconscious Leopold.

               Her co-workers, DR. PLODDER, austere, authoritative, DR. 
               DRAKE, muddled and timid, peer inside the compartment door.

               Dr. Drake and Kau make a move to inspect an unconscious 
               Leopold.

               They approach Leopold. Dr. Kau finds Carlson's note pad on 
               the ground next to Leopold. She reads the last entry.

                         Take a good long look, Leopold. I am 
                         a 20th century American woman with a 
                         Doctorate and a commission and 
                         independence. I am not your "young 
                         lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your 
                         "honey." Is that clear?

               Leopold watches her with great interest. Finally:

               Kate rummages through every drawer, shelf and cupboard

               and squeezes honey A TAD TO VIOLENTLY into the tea. She tries 
               posing "confidently" then checks her reflection in the

<b>               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
               Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room. 
               Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up 
               to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright 
               fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to 
               rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large. 
               He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button 
<b>               ON.
</b>
               Instantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before 
               an excited crowd.

               Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of 
               him as if shooing away a bee. He quickly, yet cautiously, 
               slams the power OFF.

               He quickly scurries out the hallway.

               He stops abruptly. He remains very still. Composing himself, 
               he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he 
               purposefully steps back inside.

               He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted 
               by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. 
               He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly 
               examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room.

               He looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks 
               the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment 
               in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself.

               Kate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the 
               lights, laughing like a madman. Charlie gives Kate a look.

                         that the tub and basin are scrubbed

               Kate nods at him stupefied. Due to the many layers of 
               clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing 
               skis.

               He discovers Kate at her computer, Charlie reading a book. 
               Each are wearing a walkman.

               He stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously 
               until they look up.

               Leopold studies his questionnaire, Kate researches Victorian 
               customs. They simultaneously look up and gaze at the other. 
               A beat.

               Embarrassed, Kate dons her glasses and Leopold shuffles 
               papers. They look up again. Then down. Then get back to work.

               Kate sits on her bed with her laptop watching David Letterman. 
               She glances up, laughs out loud. She looks at the dark empty 
               room. No one is there to share it with. Closing her computer, 
               she holds her pillow close to her. She slowly moves to the 
               window and looks out.

               A text book with Leopold's picture inside. Leopold reads the

               Kate scans her notes as Leopold paces dully about the room.

               A fire engine races by. Leopold dashes to the window then

               Kate walks ahead. Leopold, maneuvering a cart with a broken

               After a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand 
               and sits down at her computer. She opens her notes and types. 
               Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. She 
               looks up at Leopold lost in thought. She smiles.

               Reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to 
               the floor. In a SMASHED frame, Kate and CARLSON drunkenly 
               mug for the camera. Kate pales noticeably.

               She looks from the picture to Leopold. Slowly, she begins 
               pecking away at the keys. She does not look up again.

                         so bad yourself.

               They stand together, Leopold grinning sheepishly.

                         can charge so much.

               As she gathers her belongings, Leopold spots a very high 
               heeled red shoe in Kate's bag.

               Kate looks at him skeptically.

               She shakes her head and walks out the door.

               Kate heads down the stairs of a subway station. A few feet 
               behind, Leopold cautiously follows.

<b>               INT. SUBWAY STATION - RUSH HOUR
</b>
               Kate waits in line at the turnstile. Leopold, a ways back, 
               grimaces noticeably at the smell.

               Kate heads through. Leopold follows banging painfully into 
               the bar. A NUN hurriedly bumps into him from behind.

               He tries pushing the bar but it doesn't budge. He turns around 
               to step out of line but it is already too long. He stands 
               NOSE to NOSE with the nun.

                         Oh, for heaven's sake...

               The nun deposits her token and SQUEEZES them both through as 
               the train arrives at a deafening pitch, startling Leopold.

               He spots Kate entering the train and jumps into the car in 
               the nick of time. The train departs, Leopold pressed awkwardly 
               against the glass.

<b>               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - EARLY EVENING
</b>
               Kate races from the subway station, entering the Arthur Murray 
               Dance Studio. Leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a 
               distance.

               Elderly Blue haired couples chat amongst themselves, men on 
               the right, women on the left. Kate, in dance clothes, out of 
               breath, stumbles in, making a b-line for the women's side.

                         week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?

               Mrs. Pincus executes a fancy spin, proudly showing off her 
               purchase. Across the room, MR. Pincus beams in anticipation.

               An elderly, overly made up dance instructor enters. She claps 
               her hands together loudly.

               The men slick back their hair. The women straighten their 
               gowns. Kate stands to the side, self-consciously studying 
               the floor.

               The men take their places on the dance floor. They flick 
               their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. Cooly, 
               elegantly, the women approach their partners. After a while 
               Kate looks up, relieved. She stands alone. Ballroom music 
               plays.

               The couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. Kate 
               dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a 
               beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated YEARNING 
               look spread across her face.

               The instructor approaches with a look of resignation.

                         the mind. Let the music wash over 
                         you.

               Kate does. Her instructor shakes her head and moves away.

               Across the room, through the window, Leopold watches, moved.

               LEOPOLD'S P.O.V. -- Over the music, beyond the swirling 
               couples, Kate remains in the corner, dancing with her 
               imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps, 
               muttering to herself, dancing alone.

               Leopold and Charlie explore the city. Leopold works diligently 
               on his walk. A beautiful woman walks by in a revealing outfit. 
               Charlie catches Leopold watching her and smiles broadly.

               Leopold, caught leering, turns away sheepishly and smiles. 
               Charlie pats Leopold on the back. Stops. Pats his back again.

</b>                         Naturally.

               Cracking up, Charlie good-naturedly puts an arm around 
               Leopold's shoulder. Leopold attempts the same pulls away.

               With a headset on, Charlie listens to music. Leopold watches.

<b>                                     CHARLIE
</b>                         What'd ya say was the name of this

</b>                              (deadpan)
                         Pretty.

               Charlie stops the music and places a headset over Leopold's 
               ears. Leopold watches calmly. Charlie selects a song. 
               Instantly, Leopold's shoulders rise up to his ears. His mouth 
               opens wide.

</b>                         Megadeath. High Speed Dirt.

               After a bit, Charlie turns the music off. Leopold's shoulders 
               go down but his mouth stays wide open. Astonished.

<b>               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Charlie and Leopold walk through the park. A rubber softball 
               hits Leopold squarely on the head.

               A couple race over. The man is BLACK. The woman is WHITE. 
               Their child, ELIZABETH, 7, follows wide eyed and apprehensive.

               Leopold regards them curiously.

               Leopold stares hard at the modern familial scene. He doesn't 
               speak. After a long moment:

<b>                                     LEOPOLD

               Charlie braces for the worst. The little girl stares at 
               Leopold.

                              Elizabeth, firmly)
                         Pick a hand.

               She picks his right hand. Nothing. She picks his left. 
               Nothing. Leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from 
               his ear. She takes the ball and smiles at him.

                         She's a beautiful child. You're very 
                         lucky.

               Charlie and Leopold continue through the park, Leopold lost 
               in thought. Charlie watches him in surprise. They walk on.

<b>               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold talks animatedly. On the table -- Pumpkin pies, pizza 
               pies, and pot pies.

                         would explain Eskimo pies.

               He eats a large spoonful of pudding. Kate and Charlie exchange 
               a worried look.

                         It's revolting.

                         The pudding tonight is excellent. 
                         Another thing I've noticed, everyone 
                         is in a great rush today. Instant 
                         Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick, 
                         Minute Maid. You'll find there's 
                         much to be said for moderation and 
                         languor.

               He eats another spoonful.

                         hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going 
                         to think you don't want him to go.

               There is an awkward pause. Leopold is so enthusiastic and 
               sincere that despite a feeling of disaster Charlie relents.

                         Leo's staying with us for a while.

               Charlie pulls out a chair for Leopold but Leopold sits next 
               to Patrice instead. Patrice takes out her cigarettes.

               Leopold takes a cigarette, lights one for Patrice, then his 
               own.

<b>               INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT
</b>
               The subway car is inhabited solely by Leopold, Charlie, and 
               the oldest Ukrainian woman in New York City. Despite the 
               fact that the train is empty, they are all seated on the 
               same bench.

               Charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at 
               Leopold. The Ukrainian woman hangs on every word.

                              (quietly)
                         You have no idea what it takes to go 
                         about courting a woman. From what 
                         I've witnessed tonight, it is 
                         symptomatic of your entire generation.

               Charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old 
               woman. She rolls her eyes.

                         I believe the modern woman desires 
                         passion, protection, sensitivity. No 
                         woman wants to be romanced by a 
                         buffoon.
                              (the old woman shakes 
                              her head)
                         Banter and repartee are fine but you 
                         must add to that a different sort of 
                         playfulness.

                         pass. A woman of Kate's stature would 
                         never respond to an artificial tactic.

<b>               INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Kate enters with an arm load of Leopold's discarded clothes. 
               She drops them on his bed and begins to hang them in his 
               closet.

               A notebook falls from his pants pocket. She puts it on the 
               bureau. A beat. She quickly picks it up, sits on the edge of 
               the bed and starts to read.

               Kate smiles. She flips the page.

                         knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY, 
                         BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when 
                         I see her smile. Most beautiful when 
                         she's angry. Honorable heart... 
                         Peasant feet.

               The front door is heard slamming. Kate, alarmed, stuffs the 
               notebook back in Leopold's pocket. She races to the door; 
               glances back at the notebook, turns off the light and scurries 
               from the room.

               The corridor is darkly lit. Kate leaves the bathroom as 
               Leopold enters. They collide and separate but remain close 
               together. Both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly.

                         I guess it's time to turn in.

               She reaches her door. Leopold stops her.

               She turns. Leopold grasps for the words but the habit of 
               inaction returns.

               Charlie stands at Patrice's door with a large painting. He 
               looks over at Leopold hiding the next doorway over. Charlie 
               knocks. She opens the door.

                         of accompanying me to the cinema

               Charlie quickly looks at Leopold pleadingly. He really does 
               not want to say this next part. Leopold, however, is adamant.

               There is a long pause. Patrice watches Charlie in disbelief.

               Kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time

               She moves to her computer on the other side of the room. 
               Leopold follows. Before she can sit down, Leopold pulls out

               Leopold sits at the far end of the room. Kate takes a moment

               Holding the reins of Kate's horse in one hand, Leopold grasps 
               Kate's waist with the other as they ride a single horse 
               through the greenery of Central Park.

               Kate and Leopold eat popcorn, Milk Duds, M & M's, and large 
               drinks. The lights go down and the movie begins.

               The enormity of the medium strikes Leopold at once. He 
               involuntarily leans back in his chair grabbing Kate's 
               shoulder, watching attentively. After a bit:

               Kate looks over at Leopold and nods. Through his eyes, she 
               too experiences movies for the first time. She moves close 
               to him.

               Modern art exhibit. Leopold stares blankly at an empty white

                         Bleak!

               They round the corner, moving to the next room. Leopold's 
               smile fades.

               Charlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining 
               room table. Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs 
               into the bathroom in a BRIGHT RED DRESS.

               Charlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat, 
               Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first. 
               Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom

               Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie 
               sits down, pleased. Leopold remains standing, incensed.

               Charlie gently glides Leopold to the table. He remains 
               standing, not sure what to do next.

               Leopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room 
               table. He moves to the window and looks out. After a while 
               he pours a glass of wine.

               As they eat their dinner Larry drones on.

                         in a stock that's no good. Here's 
                         what I do...

               Kate stares absentmindedly at Larry, her mind somewhere else. 
               She looks down at the fork in her hand. She switches to the 
               proper one, reflecting on Leopold's etiquette. She notices 
               her napkin lying flat on the table. She reaches for it.

               Leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap. He begins 
               to eat his dinner. Slowly. Elegantly. Alone.

               Kate places the napkin on her lap. She stares at it a long

               Then as she leaves, a parting shot.

               Sound of keys in the lock, then Kate bursts through the door.

               The living room is dark and empty. She goes through the living 
               room, past the hallway, into the bedroom.

               His bedroom is empty. He is not there.

</b>                         Oh, Leopold...

               She runs into Charlie's studio and stops short.

               Next to Charlie's stern paintings, Leopold's portrait of 
               Kate shines in the moonlight. She wears an antique dress. 
               She is lovely. Kate sees herself as Leopold sees her and is 
               touched. She turns and collides head on with Leopold.

               He is wearing gloves and an apron. He rubs his bruised head, 
               inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face.

               He wipes his face making it much worse.

               She uses the apron to wipe away the soap. They gaze at each

                         A funny thing happened to me on my 
                         bland date this evening, Leopold. I 
                         really can't explain it. This puffed-
                         up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn 
                         kept popping into my mind all night 
                         long at the most inopportune times. 
                         I couldn't get rid of him.

</b>                         Yeah, it was. The harder I tried, 
                         the more persistent he became. He's 
                         conceited and inflated and unseasoned 
                         and it doesn't seem to matter... 
                         He's 134 years old but I can't get 
                         him out of my head.

               They kiss. A long romantic passionate kiss.

               They separate. A beat. Leopold gestures for Kate to go first. 
               They head down the hallway together into their separate rooms.

               The table clock chimes eight times. Leopold enters from the 
               kitchen dressed perfectly in the most UP TO DATE style. He 
               carries a casserole dish.

               A second later Kate enters from the hallway. She is wearing 
               an OLD FASHIONED, ANTIQUE DRESS. She looks lovely.

               Kate smiles. She looks behind him into the kitchen. A COLOSSAL 
               MESS. Leopold lights the candles and pulls out her chair. 
               This time she's prepared. He slides her chair to the table.

               The candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow 
               throughout the apartment. Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful 
               World" plays. Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine.

               They kiss. Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. They 
               kiss again. Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door. They 
               look at each other, deciding.

               Deliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door.

               Kate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips. Gently she leads

               Leopold takes her hands in his. She looks at him defensively,

</b>                         Relationships these days are much 
                         more complicated than that. Women 
                         today have certain freedoms that men 
                         have been taking advantage of for 
                         centuries. You must have been aware 
                         of that. If you think about it 
                         clearly, it should be obvious to you 
                         that marriage between us is out of 
                         the question.

               Charlie enters. Kate and Leopold become extremely

               Charlie is immediately aware that something is not quite 
               right. He studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the 
               table. Kate and Leopold serve themselves breakfast.

               Kate nods. As Leopold pours, they look at each other shyly.

               She pours Charlie's coffee until it overflows.

               As Kate wipes up the table, Charlie notices her ring. He 
               eyes Leopold suspiciously. Leopold concentrates on his plate.

               Charlie gives Kate a questioning glance. She smiles at him, 
               looking both innocent and guilty at the same time. After a 
               beat:

               All smile privately and sip their coffee without another 
               word.

<b>               INT. LAB - NIGHT

               Buried behind open books and crumpled up paper, Kate labors 
               in earnest.

               She stops suddenly, almost violently, and studies the notes 
               in front of her. The coffee cup falls from her hand and 
               breaks.

               She covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her 
               mess. She sits down slowly and peeks at her notes. She has 
               SOLVED THE PUZZLE that will send Leopold back.

               She looks up in disbelief and glances through her window 
               around the lab. Everyone is hard at work. Helplessly, she 
               stares back at the paper on her desk.

               She pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of 
               Carlson. She stares at it for a long time. She opens her 
               mouth to call for the others, stops, and looks at the photo.

               Slowly, with great indecision, Kate crumples up the paper. 
               She returns the picture to the drawer. After a long moment, 
               she opens a book, feigning research, her mind a million miles 
               away.

               Leopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering.

               Leopold concentrating on the TV with furrowed brow. She smiles 
               sadly. She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. She 
               snuggles up to Leopold. They watch TV. Together.

               winds up walking along Central Park South.

               Hansom Carriages wait to be taken out. He approaches slowly. 
               He stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horse's 
               head.

               He looks at the horse for a long time. Then he looks at the 
               skyscrapers surrounding him, deciding what to do. He lays 
               his face against the horse's head, torn.

               Leopold leads Kate to the dance floor. He opens his arms and 
               Kate steps in the way she was taught in class. Leopold pulls 
               her close.

               This time there is no pretending. Partnered together, they 
               shine. They move beautifully, effortlessly. It's almost more 
               than they can bear. As the music plays, they stop. Leopold 
               holds Kate tightly. They look at each other for the longest 
               time.

               Leopold holds Kate's face in his hands. Very slowly they 
               part.

               Leopold takes his place in the machine and straps himself 
               in. He places one hand on the red lever and the other against 
               the glass pane on the door. Kate comes over and places her 
               hand over his. Wordlessly, they say goodbye.

               After a moment, Dr. Kau gently moves Kate away. Dr. Plodder 
               silently raises his arm, signaling Leopold.

               Leopold shifts in his seat, his eyes never leaving Kate's, 
               his hand still against the glass.

               Kate smiles tenderly at Leopold.

               Dr. Plodder drops his arm signaling Leopold. Leopold pulls 
               the lever, still gazing at Kate. There is a blinding FLASH 
               of light, then darkness.

               Kate raises her head. She sits at her desk surrounded by the

               Down from the horizon, a farm house. LEO COLES, 5 years old, 
               rocks on his front porch swing. Using his bare hands as

               Kate heads straight for the kitchen. Carlson scans the living 
               room before joining her.

               Although rustic on the outside, the inside of the house is 
               furnished with antiques and is Victorian in style.

                         had called before you come over. It

                         then call, but...

               She picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently 
               she has to put it down.

</b>                         It's all right, Kate. I understand.

               There is a LONG PAUSE. Carlson gets the tea ready. Finally:

               Kate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo.

               Kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the 
               house turning off the lights. It is very guiet. All we hear 
               are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking.

               She makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. She sits 
               down by the window at her desk. She sits a long time lost in 
               thought.

               She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls 
               out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look 
               through.

<b>               THE PHOTO ALBUM
</b>
               Inside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings, 
               magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life.

               A photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he 
               departed this world. He stands stiffly beside his family for 
               a formal portrait. Very discreetly, he points to a ring. It 
               is the same ring Kate gave him.

               A newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to 
               establish a scientific center researching studies in time 
               and space.

               A magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure, 
               marching to give women the vote.

               A photograph of a large formal wedding. Leopold, around FIFTY, 
               stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing 
               to his ring.

               A magazine article shows Leopold in his SIXTIES establishing 
               a scholarship program for studies in physics. He is surrounded 
               by academia and subtly points to his ring.

               A photograph of Leopold around SEVENTY shaking hands with 
               Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras.

               A professional photograph of Leopold at SEVENTY FIVE, sitting 
               regally in a chair. Beside him, an EMPTY chair. He rests one 
               hand on the back of the chair. The other he holds against 
               his chest, showing off the ring.

               An obituary with the headline, "Philanthropist, 80, dies in 
               bombings.

               A tear falls on the page.

               Kate cries silently, looking out the window. The camera 
               follows her gaze past her property...

               as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. Kate, 
               older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder.

               Charlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children, 
               approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor.

</b>                         Of course he's happy. All weddings

                         afterwards that causes all the 
                         trouble.

               Julia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet 
               hall. She stands at the back of the large room, searching.

               Couples fill the dance floor. Across the expansive room, 
               over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the 
               guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, 
               Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN.

               Kate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's. 
               Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not 
               wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest.

               A monitor counts away the seconds. 59, 58, 57... In the 
               darkened lab, Kate, dressed in early 1920s attire, straps

               Charlie, Leo and his new bride stand back. Inside the craft, 
               the only light comes from the glowing red lever. Carlson 
               raises her arm, signaling Kate. Then to her staff:

</b>
               Kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye. 
               She grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away, 
               staring straight ahead. Charlie puts his arm around Leo.

               There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Kate is gone. The others stand 
               there motionless, stunned.

               The screen is BLACK.

<b>               EXT. A LARGE VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1924 - NIGHT
</b>
               A FLASH of light illuminates the forest at the Albany estate. 
               A BEAT. Kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn, 
               stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance.

<b>               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Huge double doors open to reveal -- AN ORNATE BALLROOM. The 
               creme de la creme have gathered and dance. Kate overwhelmed, 
               rushes down an elaborate staircase. Half way down she looses 
               a shoe. She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance 
               floor.

               In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very 
               distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young 
               woman. Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance.

                         I just love a starched white shirt. 
                         It's so elegant.

                         Beall. You light up the room around 
                         you. I thank you.

               The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a 
               sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the 
               staircase.

               The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every 
               turn as Kate searches each male face.

               In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up 
               the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up 
               the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff, 
               flouncing down the stairs.

               Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks 
               for Leopold.

               Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. 
               He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns 
               around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.

               The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.

               Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then 
               STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold 
               stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at 
               her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her 
               his hand.

               The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their 
               eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT 
               AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her 
               shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. 
               They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment 
               of youth, when they fell in love.

               Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He 
               rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands 
               are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he 
               wraps his arms tightly around her.

               MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes 
               a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count 
               silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.

<b>               THEY DANCE...
</b>
               An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest.

<b>                                     LORD WHITEHEAD
</b>                         Who is that dancing with Leopold?

<b>                                     LADY WHITEHEAD
</b>                         I've never seen her before.

               Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze 
               into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.

               At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The 
               rest of the world dances around them.

               Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO 
<b>               SCREEN.
</b>
               The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate 
               and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly 
               point to their rings.

               Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for 
               studies in physics.

               The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to 
               include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.

               The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It 
               shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching 
               chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly 
               into the camera, they show off their rings.

               SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...

               Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost 
               in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we...
