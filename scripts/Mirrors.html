"I give you the secret of all secrets. Mirrors are the gates
through which death comes and goes. Tell no one."

<b>1A   INT. NIGHT - HARLEM SUBWAY STATION                             1A   
</b>
     A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform    
     somewhere in Harlem.                                                

     A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African      
     American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform.      

     He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards     
     the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed.        

     Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back,    
     searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the     
     public restroom and runs inside.                                    


<b>1B   INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM                            1B   
</b>
     The place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed        
     while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt -                 

     The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of    
     the dark.                                                           

     The man checks each stall one at a time.                            

     His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-                 

<b>     A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO       
</b><b>     CRAWL THROUGH.                                                      
</b>
     He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight.     
     After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover-        

     A wall of bricks.                                                   

     Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door,          
     fearful of what could be waiting outside.                           

     A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard.                         

     He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen.              

     Silence.                                                            

     His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the        
     sound. The place is empty.                                          

     The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights.          

     He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror.      
     His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist         
     portrait.

     He talks to his own reflection in the mirror-                         

<b>                              MAN (CONT'D)                                 
</b>                  No, please don't...                                      

     He approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting        
     against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the          
     dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another          
     extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too        
     frantically-                                                          

     A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground.          

     Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but-                         

<b>     HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE,             
</b><b>     WATCHING HIM.                                                         
</b>
     Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become                
     independent. A separate being...                                      

     Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double.         

     The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects      
     the neon lights just like a knife blade.                              

     His eyes turn cold with fear when-                                    

<b>     HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT!

</b><b>     OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD.                                     
</b>
     Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his        
     jugular from end to end.                                              

     In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on        
     the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED.

     All the reflections catch in the glass buildings of Manhattan-        

     The traffic in the streets, the old turn-of-the-century façades,      
     the people walking on the sidewalk, the pigeons flying away, the      
     Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline reflecting off the
     surface of the Hudson River...

     Seen through the mirrored surfaces, everything in the city seems      
     to move in a distorted way. Ominous.                                  

     The softness of the sun's rising light is contrasted with the         
     eerie, haunting music.

     It's 8 a.m. The blinking digital numbers of the alarm clock
     reflect off the wooden floor of the apartment.                        

     The sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the            
     living room.                                                          

     Seen in the reflection of the TV-set, a man is sleeping on the        
     couch. He switches off the alarm and rises to go into the             
     bathroom.

     Like a thick fog, the steam from the shower fills the bathroom.
     The shower turns off. A hand reaches out to wipe away the mist        
     on the mirror above the sink, revealing-                              

     The face of BEN CARSON, 41 years old. His eyes reflect the            
     hardships of life. A life, that from the lines on his face, we        
     suspect hasn't been easy. On his chest and shoulder, SEVERAL

     Ben changes his razor blade and starts to shave his 3 day old
     stubble.

     smiles.

     We discover a whole different world-

     In the sterile environment of the NYC Chief Medical Examiner's      
     Office, forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand,            
     describe the corpses.                                               

     We are a world away from the Hollywood clichés of neatly laid
     out, immaculate cadavers. Here, some of the corpses have reached
     a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in
     contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before
     dying. From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the
     woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story...

     Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY, deeply immersed in
     an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone.                       

     Amy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN. She hesitates
     for a moment and doesn't answer the call.                           

     Amy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder.

     On 38th Street, just off of Broadway, the Mayflower has
     withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it
     to shut down-

     The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of
     the building-

     The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems
     to have spread all the way up to the top. Some of the windows
     are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an
     impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's
     architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic
     streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation.

     What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost
     ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.

     The last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes.

     Inside the department store, everything has remained the same
     since the fire, as if time stood still. The display cases, the
     departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt
     or blackened by the fire. A thick coat of soot covers the floor
     and rainwater drips down all over the place.

     Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters. He         
     listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere. This place makes him
     uncomfortable. It's not only the lingering smell of a fire, but
     also a sense of death that hangs over it.                          

     The whistling of the wind through the store's old ventilation      
     system sounds like faraway voices.                                 

     Ben and Lorenzo appear at the top of the staircase of the 2nd
     floor.

     Ben observes the surroundings- Yet another spectacle of
     devastation.

<b>                                LORENZO (CONT'D)
</b>                  Thank God you didn't show up any
                  later. This place gives me the chills
                  at night. ... No electricity, and all
                  these mirrors... You know, I live in                    
                  Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood,                    
                  and when someone dies, they cover all                   
                  the mirrors in their house. Some say
                  that it's just to renounce all vanity
                  during the mourning period, but others
                  say something else... They say it's to
                  keep the soul of the dead from being
                  trapped in the mirrors... Believe it                    
                  or not, there's always a bit of truth
                  in any superstition. Am I right?                        

     Amused and skeptical at the same time, Ben contemplates the          
     mirrors that surround him-

     Cartoons flicker on an old television set. All bundled up in a
     coat, and wearing a woolen hat, a young boy is watching TV.

     In the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance
     hall, we see Ben come down the stairs. He stops for a moment,
     facing his reflection in the mirror.

     He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not
     quite an NYPD uniform...

     Suddenly, his eyes freeze. Intrigued, he comes closer to the
     mirror and leans forward-

<b>     A HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE.

     He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it
     off, unsuccessfully. He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on
     the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. The print remains. This
     confirms his hunch-

<b>     THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR...

     By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed.

     Another. And yet another-

</b><b>     OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST THE GLASS
</b><b>     TO GET OUT...

<b>     BASEMENT IS CLOSED!

<b>     YET, IN THE MIRROR, IT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SCREECH OPEN!

     Ben swings his head back and forth, between the shut door in          
     reality and the opened door in the mirror. What is happening? Is      
     he dreaming or hallucinating?                                         

     Ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes       
     fixed on the mirror. As he goes to reach for the handle, he sees      
     his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door!          

     Ben opens it-                                                         

<b>     THE SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONE REFLECTED

     phenomenon. He opens and closes the door over and over, while         
     observing his reflection, but the mirror is no longer deceitful.      

     The staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark.         
     Ben hesitates.

      Ben walks down the stairs, step-by-step, lighting his way with a
      flashlight. The beam of light dims, the battery is almost dead.
      He gives it a few taps to make the light reappear.

     The light flickers back for a moment, revealing before him-        the
     narrow subterranean corridors of the department store.                   

     Along a wall, Ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the                
     switches. Further down in the corridor, a couple of fluorescent          
     lights flicker to life- two tiny sources deep inside the

     It's been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines
     the trees and houses.

     On the front lawn of their house, 5 year old MICHAEL and 7 year
     old DAISY are building a snowman.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                  Why did they say on TV that it wasn't
                  supposed to snow today, but tomorrow
                  instead? Why did they lie?

<b>                                DAISY
</b>                  Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael.
                  It happens...

</b>                  Grown-ups don't make mistakes. Only
                  little children do.

     Slightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman.

     Daisy's face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight
     of her father's car approaching-                                         

<b>                             DAISY

     Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile,           
     with a big wrapped package in his arms.

     The children abandon their snowman and rush towards their
     father. Ben takes Michael into his arms-

     hands over the present to his son.

     Through the front window, we see a Volvo station wagon park in
     front of the house. Amy gets out of the car, loaded with

</b>                  We are not talking about people, we're

                  you tell me you were gonna change and
                  nothing happened? It only got worse.

     Ben moves closer to his ex-wife-

     She smiles- How many other chances did she already give him?          
     Behind the firmness and intransigence she conveys, we sense Amy       
     is torn. She still loves him as well.

     In the bathtub, Daisy and Michael cannot avoid overhearing their
     parents arguing. In denial, Michael blocks his ears with his          
     hands and lies back under the water...

     Amy seems distrustful of Ben, scared of how close he is to the        
     edge. We can see the anger in his eyes...

     Ben exits the room. Amy is left alone-                              

     Through the window, she watches Ben exit the house and get into     
     his car.

     When she turns away, she discovers Michael and Daisy standing       
     outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels. She smiles,

     The beams from the flashlight are reflected in the few inches of
     water flooding the basement corridor. Since yesterday, the water    
     level has continued to rise.

     The outline of Ben and Lorenzo's silhouettes appear in the
     staircase leading to the ground floor-

     Ben rummages through the cupboards and the drawers. He finds
     some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels. He
     briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky...              

     He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant
     coffee.                                                             

     In the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching TV. It is
     past midnight. Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- It's time      
     for his rounds.

     Through the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben
     walking through the store.

     Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his
     attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking
     into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural
     manifestation.

     The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are
     all disturbing and unsettling.

     Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble        
     columns seems alive in the dark.                                    

     As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his
     attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror-

<b>     AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL
</b><b>     SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE
</b><b>     FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING
</b><b>     HAPPENED.
</b>
     How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in
     the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS...                               

     Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror-

     The vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben
     decides to check it out for himself...

     Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of
     dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHER
<b>     HAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE "FLASHBACK"-
</b>
     We follow him in the mirror-

     Ben has left the night behind and enters the "daytime"
     department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled.

     Ben continues his journey into the past.

     The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big
     sale. Children run wild in the aisles. Women fight over articles
     of clothing.                                                          

     Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes,
     a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor-

     He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE.
     Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor
     of the department store.

     Ben turns around and sees, under the shelving, A HAND LIGHTING A
<b>     ZIPPO-
</b>
     The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion.

     The liquid bursts into flame instantly. THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A
<b>     DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE-
</b>
<b>     EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINS
</b><b>     AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN
</b><b>     AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING.
</b>
     Frightened, Ben steps back-

     The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has       
     rushed to escape death-

     In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the      
     face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN?                               

     Ben has no time to react. In a split second, his uniform catches
     fire.

     Panicked, he attempts to put out the fire with his hands-

     He comes back to reality-

     Ben catches his breath, trying to come to his senses. What's
     happening to him? What he just experienced certainly felt real.

     During his panic, the flashlight rolled under one of the
     counters.

     Ben bends down to pick it up. The beam illuminates the ground
     and throws light on an object a bit further away- A LEATHER
<b>     WALLET.

      He stretches out his hand to pick it up. The leather is worn-out
      but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed
      there recently. Ben examines the object with the experienced
      touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence.

      Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper, Ben finds a
      driver's license belonging to- GARY LEWIS, 55 years old, a
      sturdily built African American man. WE RECOGNIZE THE MAN              
      RUNNING IN THE SUBWAY, AT THE BEGINNING. The name rings a bell         
      for him-

      He stops when he finds another uniform. A name is embroidered on
      the shoulder-

<b>      AGAIN THE SAME NAME: GARY LEWIS, BEN'S PREDECESSOR, THE MISSING
</b><b>      NIGHT WATCHMAN.
</b>
      The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity. He
      cannot hold back his police instincts.

      He finally empties out the contents on the table-

      A Blockbuster card, restaurant receipts, a driver's license,
      Phillips' business card from Mayflower, cash and a sheet of
      paper folded in four-

      Ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees, written in ink-

      Ben chews over these seven letters. Is it somebody's name? A           
      place? A code? Initials? He folds it up again and puts                 
      everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one       
      of the drawers.

     Sitting at the bar, Ben is nervous, tense... He removes the         
     steeped tea bag from his cup.                                       

     Ben stares at himself in the mirror, behind the bottle display
     shelves. It is not his mirror image that he is observing. His
     gaze seems to pierce through his own reflection, to dive beyond,
     into the very depths of his soul.

     In the darkness, a rat glides peacefully on the water surface.

     In the basement, the water level continues to rise.

     With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water,
     Ben moves deeper into the tunnel.

     He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light
     sweeps across the walls and the piping.

     Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall,
     he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of
     dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it
     off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OF        
<b>     PSYCHIATRY.                                                         
</b>
     He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways.

     Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer
     and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The
     humidity has pearled into droplets.

     He has found the source of the leak.

     His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben
     digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked
     water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which
     the tubing was embedded.

     Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were
     another room on the other side of the wall.

     He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it
     with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the
     gaping black hole that he has just left behind.

     Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot
     make out what is on the other side.

     He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for
     him to crawl through-

<b>     ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE

     One of the mirrors is opened, ajar- It's a door.                    

     He enters.

     His image is reflected in all directions and from infinite
     angles. Ben moves towards the center of the room-

<b>     ALTHOUGH THE ROOM SEEMED EMPTY BEFORE, SOMEBODY IS NOW STANDING

</b>
     It's a well-built man. He too is wearing the blue security
     guard's uniform.

     From where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's
     head. As he moves in closer, he can make out the name
     embroidered on the man's shoulder-

<b>     IT'S GARY LEWIS, THE FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN!
</b>
<b>                               BEN

<b>                               BEN (CONT'D)
</b>                  Gary?

     Ben comes a bit closer.

     His gaze freezes when he realizes that Gary is not standing in
     front of the mirror with his face pressed against it, but-

<b>     HE IS BEHIND THE MIRROR, INSIDE!
</b>
     Ben steps back, terrified.

     He doesn't know how to interpret this new phenomenon.

     Ben gathers his courage and returns in front of the mirror-

     Knock, knock, knock...

     He hits the mirror with his fist, as if it were merely a glass
     window behind which Gary Lewis was standing, on the other side-

     No reaction. Ben strikes the mirror harder.

     Knock, knock, knock...

     The former night watchman turns around slowly towards Ben,
     revealing his face little by little...

     In his bed, Ben wakes up with a jolt- THE ENCOUNTER WITH GARY

</b>
     Knock, knock, knock...

     Somebody is knocking at his door. Ben gets up from the couch-

     Ben opens the door to a UPS deliveryman holding out a package-

     Ben signs for it and takes the package.

     Ben shuts the door and examines the UPS box. He's not used to
     getting many deliveries. He flips it over to see who it is from-

<b>     THE SENDER IS GARY LEWIS...
</b>
     Ben grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel. He tears away the
     cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room
     table-

<b>     A DOZEN NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS LAND, ALL MIXED UP, ON THE TABLE.

     More or less recent, all the articles relate to the department

     In the darkness, the rat glides peacefully on the water surface.

     He crosses an intersection and, once again-

     He recognizes the half-visible Psychiatric Department sign on         
     the tiled wall.

     The beam from his flashlight sweeps across the walls and the

     The moisture has pearled into droplets. Slowly, his hand comes
     closer. The wall crumbles at the slightest touch...

     Pushed by curiosity, Ben begins to dig a hole in the plaster,
     just as he had done in his nightmare...

     He hears the echoing sound of streaming water, coming from the
     other side of the wall. It confirms the existence of a hidden
     room.

     Ben begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall, creating a
     large enough opening to access the other side-

     He inspects the interior with his flashlight, revealing-

     He enters. His image is reflected in all directions and
     multiplied into infinity. His dream was foreboding. Everything        
     is perfectly identical to the nightmare, with the exception of
     Gary Lewis-

      Knowing that it has been noticed by Ben, the "rebel duplicate"      
      turns his face towards Ben, eyeing him with an evil gaze-           

      We can hardly recognize Ben's image.

      From his pocket, Ben takes out Gary's driver's license. He shows
      it to her-

                   tell me something... I don't know him.
                   I've never even met him, Amy... I need

      The refrigerated compartment bays, containing the corpses, are
      aligned along the basement walls.

      A young doctor escorts Ben and Amy down the corridors of the
      morgue. As he is walking, the doctor flips through the register,
      in search of a name.

     The young doctor stops in front of the number 58B. He opens the
     door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray
     carrying the corpse, wrapped in a white sheet-

<b>                                  YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D)
</b>                  Gary Lewis...

     He lifts the sheet, revealing Gary Lewis' upper body-

     Gary's eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open. His       
     skin has become translucent, almost purple. His contorted corpse
     is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering... His         
     flesh has started to decompose and putrefy.

     Ben stares at the body, in search of a hint, a clue, any useful
     information...

     Amy becomes impatient.

     Ben jumps out of his skin and backs away, terrified. Neither Amy
     nor the doctor saw anything, of course. They gaze at him with a
     puzzled look-

<b>                            AMY
</b>                Are you OK, Ben? What's going on?

     Ben looks at the corpse and its reflection again- Gary is frozen
     in the same contorted position, as if nothing ever happened.

<b>                            BEN

     personal turn.

     On the shelves, photographs of Michael and Daisy stand next to
     the medical records and legal-medicine textbooks.

     Sitting behind Amy's desk, Ben is studying Gary Lewis' file. He
     flips back and forth through the different documents,
     photographs, and police reports.

     Amy observes him, perplexed. We sense that she is concerned         
     about Ben's strange behavior and over sensitivity.                  

<b>                            BEN
</b>                Look at this picture... Come and see,
                Amy.

     He shows her a snapshot taken by the police. We see Gary soaked
     in his own blood, the throat slit open. The picture is real,        
     crude. He lies outstretched, facing a mirror shattered into         
     several pointy pieces, like a spider web. In his hand, Gary
     still holds the piece of glass that he used to cut himself.

     Ben points to the reflection in the mirror-

<b>                            BEN
</b>                Look at the piece of mirror in his
                hand. In the reflection of the mirror                    
                it's covered in blood, and look- in                      
                reality, it's clean. Not a drop of
                blood...

     from inside the mirror- As if SOMEONE ELSE WAS LISTENING TO

     Angela leaves the bathroom. Ben brushes his teeth. He leans over
     to rinse his mouth, and when he straightens up-

     The sun sets behind the Harlem skyline.

     Ben's Oldsmobile pulls over in the street- He has decided to
     pass by Gary Lewis' old house before his nightshift.

     He presses the doorbell next to Gary Lewis' name. An old lady
     answers-

<b>                              BEN
</b>                Mrs. Lewis... Sorry to bother you... My

                Gary, at Mayflower. Could I come up
                and talk to you for a few minutes?

     MRS. LEWIS is at least 80 years old, and almost blind behind her
     thick glasses. She lives alone in the small apartment that she
     used to share with her grandson.

     We sense that she is distraught by Gary's death.

<b>                              MRS. LEWIS
</b>                ...My Gary hadn't slept at home for
                three weeks. At first I figured he had
                found himself a girlfriend, so I
                didn't worry much about it... It's
                terrible. The policeman told me that
                he was living in the streets... They                     
                found his body in the subway. Why? He
                had everything he needed here. Every
                morning I would have his breakfast
                ready when he'd come home from work.

</b>                  He didn't care much for anything
                  anymore. Before, we'd sit up and watch
                  television together. But once he
                  started that job as a night watchman,
                  he'd spend all his time-off locked up
                  in his room...

                down the name, Esseker... Does that mean

     The old lady dwells on it for a moment-

</b>                No, that don't mean a thing to me...

                down the hallway, the door at the very
                end.

     Ben follows Mrs. Lewis to her grandson's room-

     It looks nothing like the room of a fifty-year-old man, but
     rather like that of an old teenager. From what we can see, Gary
     grew up in here, and each object recalls a stage in his life.
     Everything is clean and in its proper place, it is perfectly
     tidy.

<b>                            BEN
</b>                Do you mind if I stay in here for a
                moment?

     Mrs. Lewis smiles at him. She too, likes to gather her thoughts
     in Gary's room.

     Ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue, a hint that might
     help him on the Esseker lead. He opens the drawers and looks
     through the papers-

     Nothing is of any help to him. The only place left that he
     hasn't searched is the walk-in closet, whose half-open doors
     seem to invite him to enter...

     What Ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have
     imagined- The closet has been emptied out completely, and
<b>     MIRRORS COVER EACH AND EVERY WALL, FROM THE FLOOR TO THE

      Night has fallen. The department store is calm and silent.

      We move down each floor to the entrance hall. The basement door
      is open and, in the darkness, we see the gleam of the
      flashlight. Ben must be down there.

      ALL OF A SUDDEN, A LOUD SHRIEK TEARS THROUGH THE SILENCE. There
      is a woman, somewhere in the store.

      Ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed. The shrieks
      resound through the department store again. They seem to come
      from one of the floors above.

      Without hesitation, Ben dashes up the stairs-

      He arrives on the second floor and searches through all the
      departments. Impossible to tell where the cries originate from.

      He climbs up to the third floor. The beam of the flashlight
      sweeps past each nook and dark corner-

      Somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail
      to death.

<b>                             BEN
</b>                     (shouting)

</b>
      No answer. Ben goes up to the fourth floor. The shrieks are
      heard again, but this time, coming from one of the floors below.
      Ben dashes for the Ladies' department-

<b>                               BEN (CONT'D)

      dressing rooms - or rather, what is left of them since the fire.

      The woman must be in here, hiding somewhere.

      Short of breath, Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his
      flashlight.

      The woman seems to have vanished.

<b>                               BEN (CONT'D)

      ANOTHER SHRIEK IS EMITTED, RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. He turns around-

      No one there.

      About to leave the dressing rooms, Ben catches sight of a
      mirror. In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms-

<b>      A BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE, ACCOMPANIED BY
</b><b>      ANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN!
</b>
      Ben runs to it, but finds it empty. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE
<b>      MIRROR, HOWEVER, THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM!
</b>
      Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it
      face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened
      inside.

      Ben unhooks the mirror.

      It is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down
      the wall.

      Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor.

      He reaches the last dressing room-

      Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior
      of the cubicle.

      In the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE
      TILED FLOOR. The torn, half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of
      the body...

      With his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards
      the dressing room. He is scared of what he is about to discover.
      He gives the curtain a quick yank, revealing-

     In his bed, Michael cannot stop himself from staring at the
     dimly lit mirror.

     gets into bed and turns off the light. She reaches for the

     Ben secures the padlock of the department store entrance.

     He walks towards the trailer, while keeping a fixed eye on the
     facade of the building. The scene he just witnessed in the
     dressing rooms has shaken him up.

     He goes inside. Through one of the windows we see him pick up

     She hangs up the receiver and stays in the dark for a moment,
     concerned.

     The sound of the pouring bath brings her back to reality.

     We follow her into the bathroom. She dips her fingers into the
     water to check the temperature. The bathtub is almost full.

     Angela undresses in front of the medicine cabinet mirror. When

     Without a word, Angela's reflection brings its hands to its face

     The camera flashes illuminate the crime scene.

     Angela's body lies afloat in the bathtub. The apartment is
     entirely flooded.

     Two men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep
     the intrusive neighbors away.

     A detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the
     downstairs neighbors. They were the ones who alerted the police,
     after having noticed the water leakage. The old woman explains
     how "it was raining blood into her living room"...

     Amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find
     Larry. He is in charge of the case.                                     

     Leaning over the bathtub, Larry examines the visible parts of           
     the corpse. Angela's face is concealed by her own long black
     hair, floating in the murky water.

     Larry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and            
     sinks his arm into the blood-red bath. He feels around for the          
     chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub.

     The water level begins to recede, gradually revealing Angela's
     naked corpse.

     With the tip of his fingers, Larry lifts away the few strands of        
     hair covering Angela's face-

     Taken by surprise, he steps back from the horrifying sight of          
     this JAW-LESS FACE.

     Larry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts         
     to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention-       

     He comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet              
     mirror. A TINY DROP OF BLOOD is dripping from one of the cracks.       

     Strange.

     A DARK SILHOUETTE PASSES BEHIND HIM IN THE REFLECTION. He turns        
     immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent. Angela's       
     destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub.

     A police inspector in the next room, calls out to him-

     room holds a picture frame in his hands. He turns towards Larry-

     Still wearing his uniform, Ben is sitting alone in one of the
     interrogation rooms of the police station. His haggard face
     expresses great grief. His sister's death has left him                 
     distraught.

     He fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands.

     The classic two-way mirror facing him, throws back his

     Ben knows that he is being watched.

     Behind the two-way mirror, Amy observes him. Larry is standing

     husband on the other side. He seems overcome with grief and            
     confusion. She can see the distress in his eyes.

     Ben has been released.

     Under the pouring rain, on the front steps of the police
     station, Amy tries to reason with him-

     Ben is not listening. His mind is elsewhere.

      Ben does not turn around. The rain is beating down harder and
      the thunder grumbles in the distance. The first lightning             
      flashes light up the sky.                                             

      Another flash-

      Ben ignores the crime scene's restriction perimeter and enters        
      Angela's apartment. Without turning on the light, he goes             
      straight for a leather pouch stashed among his cardboard boxes.       

      Inside- A .357 MAGNUM, his former cop weapon.                         

      Another flash-

      The lightning bolts illuminate the facade of the department

      Ben's car is parked in front of the construction fence.

      The rainwater pours through the openings in the roof,
      penetrating the interior of the deserted department store. It
      dribbles down the cracked walls and over the half-burnt
      mannequins...

     A DULL METALLIC THUD. It gets louder and louder, closer and
     closer as we advance towards the opening to the mirror room-

     Inside, we find Ben, out of his mind, throwing a chair against      
     the mirrors with all his strength, in an attempt to demolish
     them-                                                               

     He's exhausted and he's forced to stop.

     Not a single shard of glass, not even a scratch, the mirrors
     seem completely indestructible...

     Ben is not through with them. He drops the chair to the ground
     and pulls out the gun from his belt.                                

     Without a moment's hesitation he opens fire-

<b>     THE MIRRORS SHATTER VIOLENTLY, CRACKING WITH THE POWERFUL IMPACT    
</b>     OF THE BULLETS. In the spiderweb-cracked mirror, his image is       
     deformed.                                                           

     Having found a weak spot, Ben savors his sweet victory when,
     suddenly, something inconceivable unfolds before his very eyes-

<b>     THE BULLET IMPACTS DISSOLVE AS IF BY MAGIC AND THE MIRRORS ARE
</b><b>     RECONSTITUTED!
</b>
     Ben's shock and disbelief give way to rage. He fires, in a fury,
     emptying the entire clip this time-

     Again, the bullet holes vanish, leaving Ben alone, face to face
     with his own reflection. He breaks down nervously-

<b>                              BEN
</b>                  Why did you do it? WHY? WHY DID YOU

</b>
     Silence.

                  from me? ANSWER ME! WHAT IS IT YOU
<b>                  WANT?!
</b>
     Suddenly, one after the other, letters, start appearing in one
     of the mirrors, as if an invisible finger were tracing them in
     the dust-

<b>     REKESSE
</b>
     Ben turns around, and in the reflection of the opposite mirror
     he recognizes the inverted word- the same word he found on the
     note in Gary's wallet, the word Ben himself had traced in his
     bathroom mirror-

     Back in the Queens apartment, Ben still hasn't gotten any sleep.        
     On the wall, he is assembling all the newspaper clippings,
     articles and photographs that Gary sent him.

     Each and every mirror in Angela's apartment has been covered            
     with sheets, blankets, old rags- anything he could find to              
     neutralize the reflective surfaces.                                     

     With the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the
     middle of a heated conversation-

<b>                                BEN

                  Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo...
                  Esseker. No idea, my guess is that                         
                  it's a name... No, I haven't got a first
                  name. Yes, in New York. Over the past
                  five or six years. I know it's hazy
                  but that's all I've got. I already
                  looked it up in the phone book. I also
                  called someone at the IRS and at the
                  DMV, but nothing there. It's very                          
                  important Larry. You'll call me back?                      
                  Ok...

     Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered
     with clippings for a moment. Now he can have a clear overview of
     Gary's investigative research.

     All the articles date back approximately to the same period and
     are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years
     ago.

     But not a hint of Esseker.

     Ben studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story
     together-

     " Deadly Fire at Mayflower- 29 dead and 78 wounded "                    

     "   Brutal Massacre- Mother and her three daughters slaughtered..."     

     " ...the children, drowned, in the bathtub... "

     " ...the throat slit open... "

     " Mayflower's security guard taken in for questioning... "

     " The night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly
     denies the accusation of murdering his family... "

     " Terrence Berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty-
     The security guard at Mayflower finally confesses. He started
     the fire in the department store with the intention of
     destroying the mirrors, responsible, according to him, for the
     death of his wife and three daughters. "

     Ben observes Terrence Berry's face in one of the archive
     photographs. He looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind,
     surely he was a good father... Ben can't help but empathize with    
     him.                                                                

     As he looks up, Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the      
     window-                                                             

     What if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his
     family? Or what if the mirrors would do it?                         

     The phone rings-

<b>                                BEN (CONT'D)
</b>                  Yes, so, what'd you find out? Nothing

                  shit... Can you look up Berry, Terrence
                  Berry...

     Ben holds on the line, for a moment.

                  committed before his death? Wait, I'm
                  writing it down...

     Ben sits down on the bed and scribbles down the address on a
     piece of paper.

<b>                              BEN (CONT'D)

                  Thanks.

     He hangs up the phone. Under the blanket, next to him, he spots
     the T-shirt that his sister was wearing the other night.            

     The pain is too strong. He cannot hold back his tears anymore       
     and starts crying.

     The next morning -

     Heavy-eyed and sleepy, Michael is hypnotized in front of the
     weather forecast on TV.

     The hot chocolate set in front of him is getting cold. His
     sister Daisy pours herself some more orange juice. Amy, shaking
     a box of cereal, interrupts the little boy in his dream state-

     pellets, Tiger rushes over to join the rest of the family.

                  me about it...

     The little boy stays quiet.

<b>                              MICHAEL
</b>                  He doesn't want me to talk about him.

     Amy suddenly becomes more concerned and sits down next to
     Michael-

<b>                              AMY
</b>                  Why doesn't he want you to talk about

</b>                  So, he's a little boy your age, then?

     Michael gives a reluctant nod. Amy is reassured. He finishes his
     mug of cereal and goes to place it in the sink. Amy gives Daisy
     a questioning look-

<b>                              AMY (CONT'D)
</b>                      (to Michael)
                  Does he live in our street? Is it one
                  of our neighbors?

     Michael remains silent and Daisy answers for him-

<b>                              DAISY
</b>                  He lives in the mirror in our room.

     Daisy bursts out laughing... Michael glares back at her, furious.

     Puzzled, Amy reflects briefly on Daisy's remark-

     The two kids dash up the stairs. Amy is left alone to clean up
     breakfast.

     She casts a glance at the front hall mirror. Daisy's comment
     lingers in her thoughts.

     Dressed in their coats, Michael and Daisy come running down the
     stairs and rush out of the house... Amy exits the house. The car
     drives away.

     DR. MORRIS, the doctor who had once been in charge of Terrence
     Berry, escorts Ben down the corridor-                               

<b>                            DR. MORRIS
</b>                A feeling of self-hatred, generally
                triggered by a psychological shock can
                split the personality in two, hence
                creating two or more personalities
                with distinct memories or behavior
                patterns within the same individual.
                The patient then has a faulty
                perception of the existence of two
                distinct worlds, which are principally
                the "real" word, and the world "inside
                the mirror".                                             

     The two men pass a number of guards and security check-points as
     they head down towards the hospital's film and video archive-

<b>                            BEN
</b>                Did you consider Terrence innocent?

     Dr. Morris swipes his magnetic card through the electronic
     device, unlocking the door to the archives.

<b>                            DR. MORRIS
</b>                In my opinion, he was convinced that
                he was telling the truth when he
                claimed he didn't kill his family. I
                too am convinced that when it
                happened, Terrence was not himself,
                but rather his double, his mirror
                image, one might say.

     He enters the archives, followed by Ben-

     Dr. Morris' finger glides across several DV-tapes dated 2001 in
     search of one particular tape-

<b>                            DR. MORRIS
</b>                These recordings are from Terrence's
                trial. You will find that they speak
                for themselves.

     He pushes the tape into the deck. A grainy picture appears on
     the screen-

     We discover TERRENCE BERRY, sitting behind a desk. His hands are
     cuffed. Facing him, DR. MORRIS is leading the cross-examination.

     Terrence is tense and uncomfortable. He keeps his face down,
     never looking into the camera.

</b>                  What made you think you absolutely had

     Terrence remains silent. Dr. Morris repeats his question-

</b>                  What made you want to destroy those

     Terrence breaks out in tears.

<b>                              DR. MORRIS
</b>                  Didn't do what?

     Terrence becomes uncontrollable. He wrecks the folders lying on
     the desk and throws himself, head first, against a wall mirror
     that shatters to pieces.

     He is beside himself. After seeing the video footage on              
     Terrence, he has been struck with fear and panic for his family-

     Before the perplexed gaze of Rosa and his children, Ben
     agitatedly comes and goes in the hallway of the second floor. He
     is removing the mirrors from each and every room.

     He tears away the bathroom mirror, unhooks the one in the far

     Rosa fears more and more for the children and takes them under
     her protective arms. Amy is not back yet.

     The only mirror left that Ben cannot remove, is the one in the
     children's room.

     He rushes down to the basement and comes back with a bucket of
     old paint. He immediately begins to paint the wall mirror in
     order to neutralize its reflection.

                  that what you're going through isn't                    
                  easy. Angela was a part of our lives                    
                  too, but you have no right to do this

                  these damn mirrors the kids are scared
                  to death. Your son has nightmares.                      
                  He's scared Ben... Your behavior is
                  starting to rub off on him. He's only
                  5 years old... And I have to protect

     Ben can see that she is very upset about the situation. He sets
     down the paint bucket on the floor-

     He leads her back down, through the first floor, and out on the
     front steps of the house-

     Ben pulls his Magnum out of his belt and points the gun at one
     of the mirrors he has dragged outside.

     Amy steps back, terrified-

     Without a moment's hesitation, Ben opens fire. The mirror
     shatters to pieces-

     Ben keeps a piercing gaze as the bullet impacts the mirror,
     waiting for the magic to do its trick and for the cracks to
     dissolve again-

<b>     BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. THE CRACKS REMAIN, IN A SPIDER WEB PATTERN.
</b>
     Behind the front door, Ben notices Michael, watching him, in
     tears.

     Without any evidence, Ben is in over his head.

<b>                                BEN

     The neighbors, alerted by the blast of the gun, come out of
     their houses to find out what has happened.

     Ben stands alone, looking like a mad man...

     Amy holds back her tears and tries to stay in control-

<b>                                AMY

                  the kids. You are insane, Ben, and
                  dangerous... You've got to get help.

     With gun in hand, Ben walks away, dismayed, as he gradually
     becomes aware of the situation he has just created.

     He enters his car and drives off at top speed.

     Ben drives nervously. He feels guilty about his conduct in front
     of the children. A thousand thoughts rush through his head,
     leaving him in an utter state of confusion. He doesn't know what
     to do nor what to think anymore.

     Ben reaches for his cell phone and dials Larry's number-

     Ben hangs up.

     He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELA'S
<b>     CORPSE, SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT!
</b>
     Startled, he loses control of the vehicle. A truck approaches at
     full speed in the opposite lane. He barely avoids the collision.

     Two other cars appear. Ben zigzags in and out, just barely
     avoiding a fatal crash.

     He stops along the edge of the road.

     Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering
     wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. He looks up into the rear-
     view mirror again-

     ANGELA'S REFLECTION IS STILL THERE. Behind her long black hair,
     she fixes him with a milky gaze.

     Ben flies into a rage. HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS

     Ben is alone and lost.

     Under the pouring rain, the police patrol cars come and go in
     front of the police station.

     A bit further away we recognize Ben's Oldsmobile, parked on an

     A man approaches, knocks on the car window and enters the

     Angela's apartment is plunged in total darkness-                      

     Ben lays Anna Esseker's file on the coffee table and aims the
     desk lamp at his "research corner" on the wall.

     He turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it.

     On an index card filled in by Anna's parents in September 1952,
     Ben finds a Pennsylvania home address.

     Dr. Kane's first diagnosis is irrevocable - "Despite her young
     age, Anna Esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia, leading to
     withdrawal from reality, delusional and violent behavior."

     He shuffles through the first few pages of various                    
     administrative documents.                                             

     His eye lands on several photographs of Anna taken at the time        
     she was admitted to the hospital- She is just a child, yet, six
     male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front
     of the photographer. Her face is hardly discernible as she
     struggles like a wild animal.

     A high-pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind. Ben
     turns around-

     Another loud crack - It comes from one of the covered mirrors in      
     the apartment.                                                        

     Ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer. He removes the
     sheet hanging on the frame-

     A crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror. Ben
     casts his eyes over the reflection. His glance comes to rest on
     Anna's file laying on the desk-

     He goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents
     it to the mirror-

     KRAAAAACK - the crack in the mirror spreads, as if some kind of
     pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a
     reaction to the photograph...

     Through the half-opened door at the end of the hallway, we see
     Daisy brushing her teeth before going to school. The little girl        
     is humming as she watches herself in the mirror...

     Amy comes out of her room-

     She passes in front of the children's room and stops- INSIDE,           
     MICHAEL IS TALKING TO SOMEBODY. Amy listens closely, but she can        
     only hear Michael's voice. On the other side of the door, the

     The little boy does as his mother says.      He gets up and dashes
     out of the room.

     Amy's glance freezes in horror. Terrified, she almost loses her
     balance-

<b>     MICHAEL'S REFLECTION IS STILL IN THE MIRROR, SITTING IN A

</b>
<b>     HE LOOKS AT AMY WITH A BIG SMILE.

     Amy attempts to speak but can't-

     The mirror image of her son remains silent.

      Through the back window, we see Amy in front of the house,            
      growing more and more distant.

      Anna's medical file lies open on the passenger seat- At the top

      -Aerial shot-

      We fly over a lake- the waters are so placid that the forest and
      outline of the scenery surrounding it reflect off its surface,
      creating two perfectly symmetrical landscapes.

      We glide over the treetops, diving deeper into the forest, to
      follow the main road that zigzags along the slope of the hill.

      On one of the mailboxes standing on the edge of the road he
      spots the name Esseker-

      The wind blows over the land.

      In the winter season, the muddy fields have little to offer to
      the few starving crows flying over them. A feeling of desolation
      and solitude hangs over the deserted landscape.

      Ben's car has left the asphalt road behind, driving through the
      countryside down a winding dirt road.

      An old farmhouse stands at the very end of the path. If it
      weren't for the parked pick-up truck and the few piglets running
      wild, one would think that the farmhouse was abandoned.

      Ben gets out of the car and goes to knock on the door.

      His shoes sink into the mud. He walks up the steps of the porch
      and peeks inside the house through the front window. In the dark
      he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching TV. He
      can't help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or           
      turned towards the wall.                                             

      A big dog barks behind the window. Ben steps back, surprised.

      The front door opens before Ben has even made his presence
      known. A young man stares at him in silence.

<b>                                 BEN
</b>                   Hello... Is this the Esseker farmhouse?

      The young man nods.

      A woman's voice is heard from inside-

      The young man looks at Ben questioningly. Apparently he has
      never heard the name before.

<b>101   INT. DAY - FARMHOUSE BASEMENT                                101
</b>
      We are in the dark basement, under the farmhouse. The door to
      the first floor opens, letting the light in. Ben appears next to
      the silhouette of an old man- ROBERT ESSEKER, 80 years old,         
      Anna's elder brother.

      Robert walks down the steps, signaling Ben to follow him-           

<b>                             ROBERT
</b>                 You know, up to this day, the visions                    
                 of Anna's fits still haunt me at
                 night.                                                   

      They walk through the basement towards an old wooden door.          

<b>                             ROBERT (CONT'D)
</b>                  I helped my father fix up this part
                 of the basement, especially for her-

      The old man turns the key in the padlock. Slowly, the door
      swings open, revealing-

<b>                             ROBERT (CONT'D)
</b>                 Her fits were too violent. My mother
                 couldn't take her screams anymore.

      What's left of a very primitive child's room, SURROUNDED BY
      DOUBLE WIRE FENCING AND IRON BARS. Rather than a cell, it more
      resembles a HUMAN-SIZED CAGE, CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE MOST

</b>
      As he's talking, images flash on screen- painful memories from
      that time come back to him-

      Anna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of
      hate. It's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl. Her    
      howling screams. Her nails digging into her own flesh. Her
      unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and
      legs.

      Ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage. He can see Anna's
      scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of
      her plight and suffering.

</b>                   Finally, Dr. Kane from New York
                   answered my parents' cry for help. He
                   rejected the idea of demonic
                   possession, said he didn't believe in
                   it. He was convinced that Anna
                   suffered from a rare form of
                   personality disorder. He wanted Anna                   
                   under his care, at St. John's. My
                   parents were very poor, but he agreed
                   to cover all the hospital costs... In                  
                   less than five months, Dr. Kane had
                   cured Anna. It was unbelievable. She
                   was her old self again. A real miracle
                   of science.

      The nuns come and go under the arches of the monastic courtyard.

      A deadly silence prevails over the monastery, where time seems

      obedience and chastity to serve god.

      On the other side of the cloister wall, a small winding road
      zigzags between the pine trees. Ben's car draws nearer. He parks      
      in front of the entrance to the monastery.

      Ben pushes open the heavy front door. The place is dark and           
      silent. He goes to the front desk-                                    

      Behind a wooden screen he can barely make out the two nuns in
      charge of admissions. They are the only nuns granted exposure to
      the outside world. For the rest, physical and visual contact is
      strictly prohibited.

      Time goes by, and Ben grows impatient.

</b>
      Inside the house in Jersey, Amy has isolated herself with the         
      kids in the parent's bedroom. She's reading them a bedtime            
      story.                                                                

      Even if all the windows, screens, and TV are covered by               
      newspapers or painting, Amy acts in front of Daisy and Michael        
      as if nothing has happened.                                           

      In the rest of the house, everything has been meticulously            
      covered, wrapped, painted or reversed. Still, here and there, a       
      barely audible rustle pierces through the silence-

      In the children's room, the paint covering the mirror slowly
      begins to flake off...

      The newspaper wrapped around the windowpanes begins to rip...

      Ben is losing his calm. Time is running out. The nun reappears        
      behind the wooden screen-

      Ben crosses the hall and opens the door that the nun gestures
      him to.

      He enters the parlor alone. In the spare room, a chair stands by
      a wooden screen, fencing him off, once again.

     Ben sits down. Even at a short distance he cannot discern the
     face of Anna Esseker, who is now Sister Anna.

                Dr. Kane's therapy for personality

                patient up in a mirrored room for                      
                several days on end, in order to force
                him to confront his own image. I spent                 
                the darkest days of my life in that
                room. On the 6th day the nurses found
                me lifeless, almost dead. Since that                   
                day, I have never had another fit. But
                deep down inside I've always known the
                truth.

<b>                              BEN

                whatever it was, it entered the
                mirror.                                                

     We can feel the emotion in her voice.

                would have all gone away. They would
                have disappeared from the mirrors. I
                didn't know.... I'm sorry but if I                     
                agree to go with you and return to

                into the real world.

      In the hallway, the shiny doorknob leading to Amy's bedroom is

      Amy comes out of the bedroom and notices that the floor is          
      completely soaked.                                                  

      She turns on the light in the hallway, only to discover-

      The entire upper floor is covered by an inch of water- all the      
      taps in the bathroom are turned on and have transformed the
      surface of the floor into A LARGE NATURAL MIRROR...

      all the mirrors in the corridor have been scraped, bringing the
      reflecting surfaces, once again, to the light...

      As she turns in the hallway, Amy sees A DARK SHADOW MOVING IN       
      ONE OF THE MIRRORS. Terrified, she steps back and hits the          
      opposite wall. She drops the phone on the flooded floor-

     weird is happening there.                                           

     Without hesitation, Ben grabs his gun inside the car and walks

     Unsure of what she saw, Amy makes a step towards the mirror but     
     only finds her own reflection.

     She picks up the phone- The water shorted it out...

     A hand enters frame to light some candles.                          

     Sister Anna is back in her cell. The way her hand shakes as she     
     carries the match from one candle to the other betrays how upset    
     she is by the confrontation with Ben- It's been too much time       
     that she's carrying the guilt.                                      

     She runs the rosary nervously between her fingers and kneels        
     down in front of her bed to pray when-

     A loud muted sound followed by a sudden wave of agitation is        
     heard outside the cell. Someone has broken into the monastery.      
     She recognizes Ben's voice- Like a mad man, he's looking for her    
     everywhere and threatens the other nuns to show him the way.        

     Anna stands up when Ben bursts into her cell with his gun in his    
     hand. Behind him, the other nuns are terrified.                     

     Ben points the gun at Anna-

      Not intimidated by the weapon, Anna steps towards Ben. FOR THE

      With the tips of her fingers, Amy feels her way to the plug. She
      pulls it out.

      Slowly, the water level begins to go down. Too slowly. Amy
      struggles to pull her head out of the water to breath again.

      The water continues to recede. Amy has reached exhaustion, her
      hands clutch onto the edge of the bathtub. She is suffocating.

      At the last minute, she turns her head to gasp for air.

      The remaining water swirls down the drain. The bathtub is now       
      empty and the invisible force seems to have vanished.

      Amy collapses to the ground, spitting and coughing. She comes to
      her senses, gets back to her feet and dashes out of the

      Instinctively, Amy throws herself against Daisy, tearing her
      away from the grip of her own reflection. They land on the floor    
      and crawl to the corner of the room, safe from the danger of the
      reflections.

      Amy tears off a piece of her clothing, which she presses against
      Daisy's throat in order to stop the bleeding.

      Fortunately, Daisy's wound is not deep. The blade did not reach
      the main artery. Amy saved her life at the very last minute.

      Daisy is half conscious from the loss of blood. She struggles to
      speak-

<b>                               DAISY

                   take care of you and then we're going
                   to find him...OK But for now, we have to

</b>                   Yes, he'll be here soon as he can.

      A bit further away, in the scraped section of the mirror, we
      can see Amy's reflection, on its knees above Daisy who lies on     
      the floor-                                                         

      IN THIS EVIL VERSION OF THE REALITY, Amy's double has killed her   
      own daughter. Using the scissors, she's "working" on the dead      
      body. What exactly is she doing to the little girl?                

      She turns toward us, revealing HER FACE AND HANDS COVERED WITH     
<b>      FRESH BLOOD!

</b>
      IN SEARCH OF THE REAL AMY AND DAISY, the forces of the mirrors     
      are determined to get them.

      Away from the field of vision of the mirror, Amy crawls on the
      floor towards the door-

      Amy comes back to the bedroom, carrying Daisy in her arms.

      As she passes the bureau, she grabs the first-aid-kit from one
      of the drawers. She sets her daughter down in the walk-in           
      closet, away from the mirrors. The little girl has trouble
      moving.

      Amy examines the cut on Daisy's throat. Quickly, with a
      professional touch, she disinfects and bandages the wound.

<b>                             AMY
</b>                 Listen to me carefully Daisy... I want
                 you to stay in here and be quiet.

      Daisy is terrified and with her remaining strength, she holds on
      to her mother tightly.

                 happens. I'm going to find Michael... Do
                 you hear me?

      Not quite convinced, Daisy accepts reluctantly.

<b>                             AMY (CONT'D)
</b>                 I am so proud of you.

      Amy shuts the door of the closet. Through the wooden slats she
      can see her daughter inside-

      Even though she turned off the taps upstairs Amy can still hear     
      the water pouring downstairs...

      On guard, Amy walks down the stairs, step by step. She is
      frightened and her heart is pounding.

<b>                             AMY

      At the bottom of the stairs, Amy catches sight of Michael at the
      other end of the living room.

      The first floor is completely flooded. ALL THE SPACE IS COVERED
<b>      BY A THIN LAYER OF WATER THAT'S MIRRORING EVERYTHING IN HOUSE.      
</b>
      The little boy has climbed up onto a stool and is scraping the
      paint off the mirror with a sharp knife... It was Michael who had
      scraped all the mirrors in the house in order to set the force
      of the mirrors free.

      He doesn't answer. He doesn't seem to hear her.

      Amy comes down the last step.

      The little boy turns around towards his mother with a big smile-

<b>                               MICHAEL

      Amy moves slowly towards her son.

      Michael looks at her in confusion and steps down from the stool.

      Instead of obeying, Michael runs off and disappears into another

      She tightens her grip around Ben's hand. She is anxious, and
      even with her eyes shut, she can sense the threatening vibes
      sent off by the mirrors.

      Ben is focused, gazing straight ahead as they cross the ground
      floor in the direction of the basement door.

      Yet, from the corner of his eye, he cannot help but glimpse the
      mirrors. What he discovers goes beyond his worst nightmares-

      Michael's reflection sweeps over the water surface.

      Amy runs after him but stops short when she catches sight of
      him. Michael is hiding under the living room couch.

      Compared to the gloom of the basement in the department store,     
      the second floor of the house seems to be bathed in light.         

      Michael is sitting quietly in front of his room. As Narcissus      
      did, he is observing his reflection, mirrored in the surface of
      the water that covers the wooden floor.                            

<b>                                AMY

      Hypnotized by his mirror image, the little boy does not hear his
      mother's call.

      Amy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him.

                   right here.

      Michael doesn't answer. Gently, he caresses his reflection in
      the surface of the water.

      Amy comes up to him slowly, determined to pull him away from his
      reflection...

      She lays her hand on his shoulder.

      This time Michael reacts and turns towards her.

      Before he can utter a single word-                                 

<b>      THE REFLECTION OF THE HAND BECOMES REAL, GRABBING THE CHILD'S

      Amy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him. Too
      late, the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of
      water covering the floor. MICHAEL HAS BEEN PULLED INTO THE OTHER
<b>      SIDE OF THE MIRROR!
</b>
      Amy sees her son struggling under the water, as if he were
      caught under a coat of ice.

      In desperation, Amy beats her fists against the floor with all
      her strength, trying to break through to the other side.

      Flying into a rage, she beats her fists again and again in an

      She sees Michael's body sinking into the depths...

      Ben is waiting in the corridor with his gun in hand.

      In the mirror room, Anna recites a prayer for strength. IN THE

      The mirrors around her shake more and more violently-

      Ben sees cracks forming on the walls and the surface of the

      Anna's eyes freeze- her pupils constrict- thousands of shards

      The blow of the explosion causes the walls to tremble.
      Instinctively, Ben takes shelter behind the wall.

      Amy clings to him and pulls him out of the water. The little boy

      Amy tries not to lose her head, determined to bring her little

<b>      IN THE BASEMENT, THE CALM HAS BEEN RESTORED.
</b>
      Ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror
      room. In the silence, he waits. He must establish beyond a doubt
      that it's all over.

      He aims his flashlight at the surface of the water-

      Everything seems to be back to normal. His reflection is
      deformed by the slight stir of the water, slowly becoming
      placid.

      Ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room-

      All the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the           
      metal cage that was holding them in place. The floor is covered        
      with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water,
      shimmering in the shadows.

      The beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of Anna, or
      her dead body-

      Nothing...

      Ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure -         
      The woman has vanished.

      He aims his flashlight at the ceiling. The beam of light
      instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him-

      It's her, or at least what is left of her- A POSSESSED,
<b>      METAMORPHOSED, HUMAN FRAME. SHE IS BARELY RECOGNIZABLE.

</b><b>      SHE OPENED HER EYES AND RELEASED THE FORCES OF THE MIRROR.
</b>
      Ben has no time to react before "Anna" charges at him.

      He drops his flashlight to the ground, trying to resist her as
      much as he can.

<b>      HER WAY OF MOVING IS NO LONGER HUMAN. MORE LIKE A STROBOSCOPIC     
</b><b>      CONVULSION, HER MOVEMENTS ARE SOMETHING BETWEEN AN ENRAGED BEAST

      Ben manages to pin the creature against the wall. "Anna" spits     
      blood in his face.

      He applies all his strength to immobilize her- the shards of
      glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only
      seems to provide her an intense pleasure...

      "Anna" froths at the mouth. Her speech has become a deep,
      animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle.

      In an effortless movement, "Anna" pushes him away.

      Her demonic strength is ten times his. Ben is merely a puppet, a
      rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash
      violently against the brick walls...

      Blood squirts onto the surface of the water.

      Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the
      underground passageways.

      On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. He         
      strives to regain consciousness...

      Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but- 

      "Anna" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a
      backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air.

      She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room. He rams into
      the wall.

      With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless.     
      He cannot see his assailant...

      Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. His hand           
      struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back.

      Suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun. He grabs
      it, turns onto his back, and fires point-blank at "Anna".

      The bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her.

      Ben is being dragged. He manages to grab hold of one pipe after       
      the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks
      off from the wall, LETTING OUT A POWERFUL JET OF GAS.

      Once again, Ben is sent flying down the tunnel.

      He struggles to get back on his feet-                                 

      Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence
      surrounds the subterranean passageways.

      Ben makes out "Anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas      
      pipe.                                                                 

      With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore-        
      Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have             
      replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to      
      the creature, no matter what happens.                                 

      He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands,      
      towards what once was "Anna"...                                       

      Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge.      
      Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The       
      creature thrusts itself against him-                                  

      THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to          
      keep his assailant's jaw at a distance.                               

      In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES "ANNA" ON THE

      Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems                
      unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On       
      the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the

      Ben moves away, keeping an eye on "Anna". He takes his gun and        
      aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he       
      is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment.                      

      The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark.

      her arms, with all her strength, with all her love.                

      Holding Michael in her arms, Amy comes back for Daisy in the
      bedroom. She opens the closet door and finds her little girl       
      inside. The child throws herself into her mother's arms-

<b>                              DAISY
</b>                  It is over, Mom?

      Amy throws a glance at her reflection in the mirror. Everything
      seems back to normal.

<b>                              AMY
</b>                  Yes sweetheart, it's over...

      Amy holds her two children tightly, savoring this moment of joy
      and relief.

      Through the window, we see the first light of dawn appearing on
      the horizon.

      The sunbeams slice through the windowpanes of the glass dome
      above the entrance hall of the department store.

      The pigeons fly in and out...

      The burnt mannequins are still standing in the middle of the
      ruins.

      ON THE WALLS, ALL THAT REMAINS FROM THE MIRRORS IS THEIR 1920's    
<b>      GOLD FRAMES.
</b>
      The floor has completely subsided. It looks like there was just
      an earthquake under the building.

      In the middle of the pile of debris, something in the rubble
      begins to move-

<b>      A HAND APPEARS. SOMEBODY SURFACES -
</b>
      It's Ben. He gasps for air. Wounded and covered in dust, it is a   
      miracle that he has survived.

      He struggles back to his feet and climbs over the blocks of
      concrete to regain the ground floor.

      Limping, he crosses the entrance hall. His discovery of the
      absence of mirrors on the walls brings a smile to his face- He
      has finally triumphed over the mirrors that he once believed to
      be indestructible...

      Ben steps out of the department store, walks out of the closed      
      off area, and reaches the street.                                   

      Police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances with spinning lights       
      have surrounded the fencing.                                        

      Ben approaches the scene. He needs medical attention. He catches    
      sight of Lorenzo, talking to some policemen. Ben stops dead in      
      his tracks-

      Ben glances at the police vehicles and their license plates-        

      How is it possible? EVERYTHING IS REVERSED.                         

      Ben steps back in panic.                                            

      As he walks away from the scene we discover something else in       
      the back of the ambulance-

      Ben walks up west 38th Street to Broadway and stops at the          
      intersection of the streets, paralyzed with fear-                   

      The activity of Time Square seems normal for an early morning,      
      cars driving by and the eternal hustle and bustle of the            
      pedestrians, but ALL THE SIGNS, ALL THE BILLBOARDS ARE REVERSED.    
<b>      AND SO IS THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAFFIC FLOW...

      Ben turns around towards a glass building where a homeless          
      person is sleeping-                                                 

      His eyes fill with horror-                                          

<b>      HE CAN SEE THE REFLECTION OF THE HOMELESS MAN BUT NOT HIS OWN..

      Ben presses his hand against the glass. The reflection of the        
      world surrounding him is the right way around in the mirror but      
      he remains invisible.                                                

      He removes his hand from the mirror, leaving a clear and well-       
      defined handprint on the reflective surface.                         

      Ben slowly comes to realize what is happening to him -               

<b>      IF HIS REFLECTION IS NOT THERE, IT MEANS THAT HE NO LONGER

      Back in the ambulance, a paramedic comes to close the back door.     

      The vehicle starts and leaves the Mayflower.

      In the back of the ambulance, as the vehicle drives away, we         
      discover that another corpse is laid out next to Anna's-             

<b>      IT'S BEN'S BODY, COVERED WITH DUST AND DRY BLOOD.

      Its fingers suddenly twitch...                                       

      Was it the bumpy road?                                               

      The dead fingers twitch again and-
