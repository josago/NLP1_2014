               heavily swimming in his lane, although he looks tired and
               bored, not really fit for training. He stops, exhausted at
               the end of a row, looks at his friends happily discussing
               by the side of the pool, then at coach Salan in his office
               glass booth overlooking the swimming pool. Conrad reflects.

                            Conrad. You see, I knew something
                            was wrong even before he tried
                            to... to kill himself. But I

                            he's very smart. He's been an "A"
                            student ever since he started
                            school, and naturally I thought

                            work out their own problems.
