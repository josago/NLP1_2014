                I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet 
                seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. 
                And i've learned to live with this chicken 
                Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the 
                past three years, so I knew Dad would be 
                devastated when he learned of my latest 
                affliction.
                        (to Harry)
                Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left 
                breast is developing at a significantly faster 
                rate than my right. It can only mean one 
                thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.

                O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of 
                the fridge.

<b>        FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE
</b>
        Vada closes front door and goes down the steps to a group 
        of boys

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                All right, who's in raise your hand.

        All the boys raise their hands except Thomas J

<b>                                 BOY
</b>                Are you coming or not Thomas J?

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                I don't think so.

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                I knew he wouldn't come.

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                I can't, I have to go home.

<b>                                 BOY#2
</b>                Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.

        Group of boys enters house lead by Vada

        Once inside, the group is suddenly stopped

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                        (to boy#2)
                Hey, you didn't pay me!

<b>                                 BOY#2
</b>                How do I know you were gonna show us one?

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                You're such a baby.

<b>                                 BOY#2
</b>                All right, here.

        Boy reaches inside his pocket, gets money out and gives it 
        to Vada

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                All right, follow me and don't say a word.

        They walk towards two large doors, stop, and Vada turns 
        around

                You ready?

        They enter the coffin display room, and move over to the 
        coffin in the middle of the room

                You sure you wanna see it, or is someone 
                gonna go yellow belly?

<b>                                 BOY#3
</b>                I'm not chicken!

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Okay. Lean forward.

        A tense moment as the coffin lid is flung open by Vada and 
        the boys gasp as they look inside

<b>                                 GIRL#1
</b>                It's empty!

<b>                                 BOY#2
</b>                You're so weird!

<b>                                 BOY
</b>                I want my money back!

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                I was afraid of this.

        They begin to move into another part of the house

<b>                                 BOY#2
</b>                Of what??

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not 
                completely dead, you know, like when they cut 
                a chickens head off and it still runs around 
                crazy.

<b>                                 BOY#3
</b>                You're full of shit.

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                I bet she's roaming around this house 
                somewhere.

        They open the door into the living room, where Grammoo is 
        in her rocking chair

                There she is, in the rocking chair.

        Pause, then Grammoo begins to rock the chair gently. The 
        boys all gasp and then all exit very quickly

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Hi Grammoo.

        Vada seats herself upon Grammoo's lap

                        downstairs)
                Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?

        Vada gets up and begins to leave

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Seeya later.

<b>                                 ARTHUR
</b>                You took woodshop?

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Yeah, I made a tie rack.

<b>                                 ARTHUR
</b>                I made a tie rack.

        Vada comes down the stairs and stops just before the corner 
        that would allow her to see the corpse of Mr. Layton

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Ahem.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Vada, just put 'em on the stool.

        Vada places the packet on a stool

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly

</b>                        (completely ignoring Vada's 
                        comment)
                Ya, that rack holds six ties.

<b>                                 ARTHUR
</b>                I still have mine.

        Vada recognizes Arthur's voice

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Arthur!!

        Harry is slightly annoyed at Vada distracting them

                head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.

        Arthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a 
        demonstration

                See. You were looking at the ball. All right? 
                Keep your head up. Gimme some skin,

        They both give each other five i.e. Slap each others hands, 
        Arthur exits. Vada continues bouncing the ball, which 
        accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the 
        basement

<b>        SCARY MUSIC
</b>
        Vada goes very slowly down the stairs, and peeks round the 
        corner, she is clearly very scared of the basement and the 
        corpses contained in it, she then rushes down and grabs the 
        ball. As she turns around, Shelly, who is upstairs walking 
        through the house and sees the door ajar, slams it shut 
        unaware that Vada is down there. Vada runs up the stairs and 
        tries to open the door, she can't, drops the ball and starts 
        to yell out for help and bang on the it. Shelly hears the 
        noise and comes to the door. Vada, overcome with fear, sits 
        on a step, covers her ears and begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-
        diddy. Shelly yanks the door open and sees Vada crouched on 
        the step

        Harry gets up from his desk, moves over to Mrs. Porter and

                I think she looks nice! Her lips are very 
                thin so I used the gloss to give them a more 
                sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a 
                little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, 
                nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.

        The two enter the garage, where a large black hearse is 
        parked

        Vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably

</b>                That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, 
                they used to study the bumps in your head to 
                see if you had a good personality or not. Come 
                here, i'll diagnose your head.

        Vada examines Thomas J's head and then compares it with the 
        chart

</b>                You have no personality.

        Thomas J knocks the lid off a small box and reveals a photo

</b>                Is that your Dad?

<b>                                 VADA

</b>                Who's that with your Dad?

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                It's my mother.

</b>                Do you remember her?

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                I think, everybody gets their own white 
                horse, and all they do is ride and eat 
                marshmallows all day, and everybody's best 
                friends with everybody else, when you play 
                sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets 
                picked last.

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular 
                horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal 
                if you fall, you just land in cloud.

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll 
                never find that streamer.

        As they leave, Vada turns back and grabs the photo, then 
        returns to Thomas J

        Harry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out 
        the door

                but I play the odds, when choosing bingo 
                cards, I use a range of theories from the laws 
                of probability to avoiding duplicate number 
                systems. This way you get much more activity.

</b>                We have a winner. Will the winner please 
                raise their hand?

<b>                                 CARL
</b>                There was no bingo, it came from outside.

<b>                                 VERNON
</b>                How could someone outside get a bingo?

<b>                                 CARL
</b>                Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone 
                outside yelled bingo you moron!

<b>                                 VERNON
</b>                Who are you calling a mowon?
                        (false teeth)

<b>                                 CARL
</b>                Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years 
                old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!!

        The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break 
        it up

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game.

        Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing

<b>        OUTSIDE
</b>
<b>                                 VADA
</b>                We can go now.

        Vada and Thomas J run off down the street

<b>        VADA'S BEDROOM NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED THINKING
</b>
        As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her 
        window and looks out it through the venetian blinds

<b>        OUTSIDE STOPPED CAR
</b>
        Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side 
        and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers 
        advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, 
        eventually

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                I had a good time tonight.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

        They walk up to Shelly's camper

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Would you like to come in and see my house? 
                Just for a minute.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Okay, sure.

        They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room

<b>        INSIDE CAMPER, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER
</b>
<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Home sweet home.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                It's nice.

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                I did it myself. I read a magazine article 
                about how to maximize small spaces.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                You can look in the bathroom if you want. 
                People are always curious about that, like 
                what happens when you flush.

        Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the 
        bathroom, and then flushes the toilet

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Yeah.

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Are you mad at me?

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                No, why?

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                I don't know, tonight you just seemed a 
                little cool, not opening car doors and...

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice 
                on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of 
                touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not 
                since my wife died.

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                What happened to her?

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Ahh, complications during child birth, she 
                died two days after Vada was born.

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Did she ever see Vada?

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                I brought the baby into the room a couple of 
                times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think 
                she saw Vada. It was.....

        Harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling 
        with to calm his nerves

                Did I ruin this?

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Dance with me?

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Here?

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                This is where we are.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Is there enough room?

        Shelly moves an object from the floor, which creates more 
        room

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                I haven't danced in.....

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                In ages, I know, me neither.

        They begin a slow dance

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Rock?

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                See, you're not that out of touch.
                        (they dance)
                You're good.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot 
                date, I did a killer frugue.

        Shelly smells Harry's neck

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                What are you wearing?

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.

        They continue to dance

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Do you want to?

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Want to what?

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Kiss me.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Yes.

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Good.

        They then have a long kiss

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very 
                optimistic.

        They then kiss again, this time interrupted by the clock 
        cuckooing

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                I ahh, better go.

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                It's only eight o'clock.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                Goodnight Shelly.

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Goodnight.

        Harry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the 
        door

<b>        OUTSIDE CAMPER NIGHT, HARRY HAS JUST GOT OUT OF SHELLY'S

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Well, I guess it's official we had a date, 
                maybe we can play bingo again sometime.

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that 
                drive in of yours.

<b>                                 SHELLY

<b>        SUMMER WRITING CLASS DAY
</b>
<b>                                 MR. BIXLER
</b>                Before the class started, Ronda and Justin 
                wanted to lead the class in a group 
                meditation.

<b>                WOMAN
</b>                Ooooh that's really cool.

<b>                                 JUSTIN
</b>                Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes 
                out into the group.

        Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play 
        weird music

<b>                                 RONDA
</b>                Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. 
                Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.

<b>                                 JUSTIN
</b>                Now, try to feel what the other person is 
                feeling, without speaking any words, send out 
                your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at 
                the same time. Can you feel it?

<b>                                 RONDA
</b>                Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody 
                feel?

<b>                                 GUY
</b>                I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.

<b>                OTHER GUY
</b>                I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, 
                she's so cosmically in tune.

<b>                                 RONDA
</b>                So right on, that's exactly what I sent out, 
                and I felt like, you were full of inner peace 
                and harmony.

<b>                                 MR. BIXLER
</b>                Vada, what did you feel.

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                I felt Justin's hangnail.

<b>                                 JUSTIN
</b>                No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a 
                hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul, 
                feel my aura.

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                I don't think I'm allowed to.

<b>                                 JUSTIN
</b>                I tell you what, let's try it again, hold 
                hands.

<b>                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
</b>                Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. 
                It got infected and traveled to her vocal 
                chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't 
                think Grammoo thought it was insignificant.

<b>        VADA'S ROOM, VADA LYING ON BED THINKING
</b>
        Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo, 
        she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed 
        and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual 
        healing

<b>        SUPERMARKET DAY, VADA AND HARRY ARE SHOPPING

        Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out

<b>                                 SHELLY

<b>                                 HARRY

<b>                                 HARRY
</b>                I'm looking forward to that.

        Vada, who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and 
        Shelly, obviously does not like the idea of Harry & Shelly, 
        and she rams her cart into Harry

<b>                                 HARRY

                        prunes)
                Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL

</b>                Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the 
                cart, anything at all.
                        (to Shelly)
                I don't know what's gotten into her today.

        Vada begins to throw cans of every description from the 
        shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals, not 
        giving a stuff what they contain

<b>                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
</b>                I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie 
                dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas 
                I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do 
                was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't 
                too upset when they took that wrong turn and 
                went over a cliff.

</b>                No, sweetie, not yet.

        Shelly begins to brush Vada's hair with her fingers, which 
        Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off

        Shelly again tries to fix up Vada's hair
                        (which there doesn't appear 
                        to be anything wrong with)
        And Vada shakes her off again

                burn your nose, look out.

</b><b>        THOMAS J, HOW TO USE IT AS A WATER GUN
</b>
<b>                                 NURSE RANDALL
</b>                So you fill it with water like this, and what 
                have you got? A water gun.

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                Cool, can I get one for Vada?

<b>                                 NURSE RANDALL
</b>                Oh yes, yes.

        She gets another one out of her drawer

                Thomas, let me ask you a question. Does Vada 
                ever tell you why she comes down here so much?

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                Cause she's dying.

<b>                                 NURSE RANDALL
</b>                Do you think she is?

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                No.

<b>                                 NURSE RANDALL
</b>                Why do you think she says that?

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                Cause she gets scared of all those dead 
                people in her house, and you know that saying, 
                If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if 
                she's one of them, she won't be as scared.

<b>                                 NURSE RANDALL
</b>                You know what I think? I think Vada's very 
                lucky to have a friend like you.

        Nurse Randall hands Thomas J another syringe

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                She's my best friend.

        The door to the doctor's surgery opens and Vada exits

<b>                                 NURSE RANDALL
</b>                Miss Vada, how are you feeling?

<b>                                 VADA

</b>                What?

        Thomas J begins to run, and as he passes Vada he squirts 
        his syringe at Vada

<b>                                 THOMAS J

        Vada at this point is unarmed, and she chases Thomas J down 
        the stairs

        Thomas J stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and 
        begins to squirt the beehive

<b>                                 VADA

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                For their meat.

        The two start throwing rocks at the hive, which gets 
        damaged and eventually falls to the ground

                David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, 
                and the next day they came down with

        They get on their bikes and begin to ride off

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                California, I'm going to Hollywood to live

<b>        SOMEWHERE ON A PATHWAY IN A LIGHT FOREST, VADA AND THOMAS J

        Thomas J stops and then does Vada

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                That's it.

        Thomas J goes and sits down on the river bank, Vada follows 
        with an annoyed look

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                My Dad gave Shelly a ring.

<b>                                 VADA

</b>                They're getting married?

        Vada nods her head

<b>                                 THOMAS J
</b>                So now you'll have a mother.

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                I don't like her.

<b>                                 THOMAS J

        Thomas J climbs down from tree, and leaves

</b>
<b>        VADA STILL IN TREE NIGHT, SHE LOOKS AROUND AND THEN DECIDES 
</b><b>        TO GET DOWN
</b>
        Vada jumps down, and we can now see that the tree was on 
        the Sultenfuss' front lawn

<b>        INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT DOOR, VADA ENTERS AND CLOSES IT
</b>
        As soon as Vada has entered, she waits for someone to come 
        running and ask her if she's all right, where she's been, 
        they were so worried etc., Nothing happens, all she can hear 
        is the noise that the TV is making. So she opens the door 
        again and slams it. Still nothing. She decides to give up, 
        and go find Harry, she walks to the living room where the TV 
        is on, Harry and Grammoo are asleep in their chairs

        Vada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed

<b>                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
</b>                In social studies we learned some people 
                stole the Limburg baby right out of his house, 
                I think i'll sleep with my window OPEN

        Vada tries to run away, but Shelly stops her

<b>                                 SHELLY
</b>                Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?

        Door bell is heard ringing

<b>                                 VADA
</b>                Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna

</b><b>                NO!

        Vada pushed Thomas J hard enough to make him fall over, she 
        is angry

                Get outta here!! And don't come back for five 
                to seven days!!!

        Vada runs inside and slams the door, leaving poor Thomas J 
        sitting on the porch looking startled

<b>        FUNERAL ROOM OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, PIPE ORGAN IS BEING

</b>                Grammoo, I'm going to the bathroom, i'll be 
                right back.

        She then gives Grammoo a little kiss, and makes her way out 
        of the living room to the bathroom, closing the door behind 
        her, as she goes to enter the bathroom she hears giggling 
        coming from the next room, so she goes to investigate. Harry 
        and Shelly are kissing and giggling. As she is watching 
        this, Grammoo gets up, enters the funeral room and makes her 
        way to the front, when she gets there, she picks up a rose, 
        takes a look at the dead man, and begins to sing into the 
        rose as if it were a microphone

<b>                                 GRAMMOO

                place, just you and me.

        As this is being sung, Vada hears and turns around with an 
        OH SHIT look on her face, Harry and Shelly also hear it 
        and make off for the funeral room, Vada quickly retreats 
        into the room where Harry and Shelly were, closing the door 
        behind her

                So santa-macho, I got a little story you

        Vada breaks free from Harry's grip, and walks briskly out

        Thomas J comes across the beehive, inspects it and then 
        kicks it, he waits and then once he is adamant that there is 
        no danger, he begins to search for Vada's mood ring, he 
        searches, and as he does so, bees begin to swarm, he finds 
        the mood ring, and by the time he notices that there are 
        bees everywhere, it is too late..

                to that question, but I can tell you that God 
                has chosen Thomas J for some very special 
                reason, we must find solace in knowing that

                finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and 
                I are gonna be in the same home room and the 
                republican party just re-nominated Mr. Nixon.

        Vada and Judy ride off down the road on their bikes, the 
        camera angle rises and the credits begin to roll as the song 
        My Girl plays


<b>        THE END  
</b>
