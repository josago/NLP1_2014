<b>	
</b><b>	INT LARGE, DARK ROOM NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	In the ebony shadows of a large room we can make out corners and edges, 
	moldings and cornices; the phantoms of decaying Victorian wealth 
	floating like disembodied ghosts in the darkness.
<b>	
</b>	It is May 6, 1924 The harsh flare of a match being struck
<b>	
</b>	A shadowy male figure lights a series of nine candles on a birthday 
	cake. Beyond the cake we can see a bed.
<b>	
</b>	On the bed lies a woman in her early forties. She is ashen and sickly. 
	Dying.
<b>	
</b>	The shadowy male figure finishes lighting the candles, blows out the 
	match and disappears as the woman peers into the darkness.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WOMAN 
</b>	          Come into the light.. Come into the light
<b>	
</b>	A nine-year-old boy steps into the light.
<b>	
</b>	She pulls him close and whispers:
<b>	                         WOMAN 
</b><b>	
</b>	Never stand in the shadows --
<b>	
</b><b>	                         BOY 
</b>	          Mother...
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WOMAN 
</b>	          You are made for the light, Orson Now you must blow 
	          out your candles. But you must always remember, the 
	          cake itself is nothing. The flame, the lights, that 
	          is where your future lies. You must have a dream. A 
	          great dream worthy of you.
<b>	
</b>	The boy immediately spins to the cake and blows out the candles. A 
	moment of darkness. He turns back to the bed. The woman and the bed are 
	gone, faded into darkness.
<b>	
</b>	The solemn young lad stares and stares into the darkness
<b>	
</b>	And then, magically, the faint glimmer of twinkling stars fill his huge 
	dark eyes.
<b>	
</b>	NEWSREEL The flickering images of an old newsreel, circa 1940
<b>	
</b>	Under the MGM logo we see the title: BOY WONDER WOWS HOLLYWOOD!
<b>	
</b>	The first image after the title is the imposing figure of ORSON WELLES, 

	climbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet.
<b>	
</b>	Welles is 24 years old and somewhat handsome. Welles seems rather 
	uncomfortable in his own body, as if it could not possibly contain his 
	vast passions and appetites.
<b>	
</b>	Orson Welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary 
	energy. He is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly 
	ambitious. He is part artist, part fraud and all showman.
<b>	
</b>	A sonorous voice accompanies the newsreel. The voice is always grand, 
	occasionally sardonic.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          He came to the town of magic and dreams a flashing 
	          star blazing through the firmament of illusion. And 
	          he promised to devour the world in a single gulp. He 
	          was 24 years old and his name was George Orson 
	          Welles. Sound the trumpets! Unfurl the banners, 
	          Hollywood! The Boy Wonder has arrived!
<b>	
</b>	Images of Welles as a baby and his early life fill the screen: Welles 
	in a crib; as a pampered schoolboy; at dance class; drama club; dressed 
	up for a magic show. As we hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          He made his debut on the world stage in Kenosha, 
	          Wisconsin, on the 6th of May, 1915. And on the 7th 
	          of May he spoke his first words, and unlike other 
	          children who say commonplace things like "momma" and 
	          "poppa", he proclaimed "I am a genius!"
<b>	
</b>	At three the genius was reciting Shakespeare and at eight he had taken 
	up cigars and highballs and was learning magic from the  knee of the 
	great Houdini.
<b>	
</b>	Images of Welles' early theatrical career: the young man playing 
	impossibly old parts; vaudeville magic shows; various regional 
	theaters; endless tawdry rehearsal rooms
<b>	
</b>	Then images of Welles and JOHN HOUSEMAN in New York: the great, 
	bustling city; Welles at work with John Houseman on a script; Welles 
	directing a play. As we hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          So how could the magic of the stage not call to 
	          this adventurous lad? Unstoppable and resolute, the 
	          Boy Wonder journeyed into the world of the legit 
	          theater. After a peripatetic beginning he found 
	          himself at last in New York where he joined forces 
	          with theatrical producer John Houseman under the 
	          august auspices of the WPA Federal Theater.
<b>	
</b>	A rehearsal room interview with John Houseman, who is in his 30's, 
	thin-lipped and prim:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HOUSEMAN 
</b>	          Orson barreled in and took over. Orson's a real 
	          barreler.
<b>	
</b>	Images of Welles directing his famous "Fascist JULIUS CAESAR" and 
	"Voodoo MACBETH" productions: auditions; rehearsals; perfecting a 
	sword-fight; rejecting classical costume sketches for JULIUS CAESAR; 
	supervising set construction; performing Brutus in the Albert Speer-
	like Nuremberg rally lighting of JULIUS CAESAR. As we hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          Like Hannibal over the Alps, the Boy Genius invaded 
	          the Great White Way. He stunned the sedate elite of 
	          New York theatre with production after production. 
	          From MACBETH with an entirely colored cast to a 
	          Mussolini-inspired JULIUS CAESAR!
<b>	
</b>	More images of New York, Welles, Houseman and radio: Welles directing a 
	radio play with sweeping energy; supervising the elaborate sound 
	effects; editing the script; at odds with Houseman. As we hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          Though he wowed the critics with his spectaculars 
	          the ticket sales left something to be desired. So, 
	          after founding the Mercury Players with Houseman, 
	          young Mr. Welles quickly set his sights on the 
	          airwaves. He quickly became the sonorous -' voice of 
	          "The Shadow." ''
<b>	
</b>	Newsreel footage of Welles at a standing radio microphone;
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The 
	          Shadow knows. . .
<b>	
</b>	Welles laughs his sinister Shadow laugh and we go to more images of 
	radio and the dynamic Welles performing and directing as we hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          With Lament Cranston in one pocket and his own 
	          radio show. The Mercury Theater of the Air, our Boy 
	          Wonder filled the night with his resounding tones. 
	          And on October 30th of 1938, he became what he felt 
	          destined to be: a household name.
<b>	
</b>	What started out as a roguish Halloween prank became the most famous 
	radio show in the history of the galaxy!
<b>	
</b>	Images of the WAR OF THE WORLDS broadcast and panic: listeners huddling 
	next to their radios; telephone switchboards lighting up; New Jersey 
	State Motorcycle Troopers zooming down rural roads; cars clogging the 
	highways. As we hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          THE WAR OF THE WORLDS sent this nation spinning 
	          into a frenzy. Nine million listeners clasped their 
	          loved ones close and looked to the skies with 
	          horror. Unlucky listeners near the epicenter of the 
	          "invasion" -- rural New Jersey -- ran screaming into 
	          the night, sure a monstrous alien and a fiery death 
	          awaited them around every corner! The mischievous 
	          Boy Wonder had fooled us all!
<b>	
</b>	Newsreel footage of a packed press conference with Welles the day 
	following the broadcast:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	             (contritely)
	           Of course ... of course ... if I had known the 
	          panic the broadcast was causing -- well I would have 
	          stopped! I never meant for any of this to happen and 
	          I feel just horrible!
<b>	
</b>	Quick newsreel clips of Welles leaving the press conference with 
	Houseman. We see them slip into a taxi. Inside the taxi we can just 
	glimpse Welles exploding with laughter.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          How long, oh how long could it possibly be before 
	          the sunny land of dreams tried to harness the 
	          combustible power of this showman, this impresario, 
	          this best of all possible Boy Wonders?!
<b>	
</b>	Images of Welles posing and shaking hands with GEORGE                          
<b>SCHAEFER
</b><b>	
</b>	Schaefer is an intense, compact man in his early 50's. His nickname in 
	Hollywood is "The Tiger" -- both for his admired tenacity and his 
	feared temper. He is a moral and ethical man; John Adams in a Brooks 
	Brothers suit.
<b>	
</b>	As we hear
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          The winner in the Welles derby was George Schaefer, 
	          the head of RKO Pictures. With a contract 
	          unimaginable before The Days Of Orson, Mr. Schaefer 
	          captured the whirlwind snared the beast, roped the 
	          tyrant!
<b>	
</b>	Images of Welles and Schaefer: Welles signing his contract; smiling to 
	Schaefer; Schaefer making a speech; Welles joking with reporters. As we 
	hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          Eyebrows raised and jaws dropped all over 
	          Hollywoodland when the terms of the deal that lured 
	          The Great Orson came forth: the Boy Wonder could 
	          produce, write, direct and star in his own projects 
	          with budgets up to $500,000 a picture! He would have 
	          total control over the shooting of the picture and 
	          the finished product. The studio, well, they just 
	          paid the bills. Meanwhile, the insiders of filmland 
	          were skeptical.
<b>	
</b>	An interview with a Hollywood Insider, who looks like a bookie:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HOLLYWOOD INSIDER 
</b>	          John Ford doesn't have a deal like that. Cecil B. 
	          DeMille doesn't have a deal like that. No one has a 
	          deal like that! If ya ask me, George Schaefer is 
	          just plain nuts
<b>	
</b>	Images of Welles arriving in Hollywood and touring the town: Welles 
	climbing down from a plane; posing with Schaefer before of the RKO 
	gates; touring the studio; leaning over an editing machine; laughing 
	with female extras in the commissary; posing in front of his Brentwood 
	home. As we hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          So Cometh Orson! He toured the RKO studio and met 
	          with the biggest of the big! He charmed his way 
	          through the town from the Brown Derby to the 
	          Copacabana, from the Pacific Palisades to the 
	          Hollywood Hills!
<b>	
</b>	More images of Welles in Hollywood: Welles touring the town; visiting 
	all the nightclubs and dancing with beautiful women; he is seen 
	everywhere about the town. As we hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          Yes, the Boy Wonder had arrived! He even charmed 
	          those rival maidens of Hollywood gossip, those well-
	          coiffured chroniclers of the dream factory: Hedda 
	          Hopper and Louella Parsons.
<b>	
</b>	Shots of Welles with LOUELLA PARSONS and HEDDA HOPPER
<b>	
</b>	Louella is a much-feared gossip columnist. She is a gorgon in her 60's; 
	Margaret Dumont possessed by the devil and tanked up on gin. Her 
	capricious cruelty is only matched by her fervent loyalty to all things 
	Hearstian.
<b>	
</b>	Hedda is a gossip columnist in her 50's. She is given to elaborate hats 
	and villainous intrigue. Louella's younger, smarter rival, Hedda 
	probably spends her spare time eating children.
<b>	
</b>	Then a snippet of an interview with Louella:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         LOUELLA 
</b>	          Orson is the sweetest boy. We're both from the 
	          midwest, you know. He's just a local fella making 
	          good, ya follow?
<b>	
</b>	More shots of Welles just after his arrival in Hollywood, blissfully 
	touring the RKO facilities as:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         NEWSREEL VOICE 
</b>	          So today, almost a year after his arrival in 
	          Hollywood, we leave the Boy Wonder still hard at 
	          work developing his much-anticipated first feature, 
	          preparing to dazzle us all again. We're waiting, 
	          Orson!
<b>	
</b>	Welles after his RKO tour, smiling mischievously, stands before a 
	microphone:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          I'll tell you what, this is the best electric train 
	          set a boy ever had!
<b>	
</b>	"The End" and newsreel credits
<b>	
</b>	The newsreel sputters to a stop in a screening room. A shaft of light 
	shines on a large MGM logo on one wall. Another shaft of light 
	illuminates the sitting figure of LOUIS B. MAYER.
<b>	
</b>	Mayer is a short, crafty, bespectacled man in his 50's. His cloying, 
	avuncular exterior only fleetingly disguises the film titan's 
	outrageous barbarism.
<b>	
</b>	Another shadowy figure, a Mayer FLUNKIE, can be just glimpsed sitting 
	elsewhere in the screening room.
<b>	
</b>	Mayer glowers at the darkened screen for a moment.
<b>	
</b>	A beat.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MAYER 
</b>	          Who does that cocksucker think he is?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         FLUNKIE 
</b>	          They're laying bets over on the RKO 
	          lot that this great deal will end up 
	          with him never doing a picture. Back 
	          to New York he goes.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MAYER 
</b>	          Serves him right. I mean can you stomach the 
	          arrogance?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         FLUNKIE 
</b>	          Inside skinny says the glory boy's finished, 
	          can't come up with a movie. Wants to do a biography now.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MAYER 
</b>	          After RKO boots him maybe we'll pick him up cheap. 
	          Have him do that WAR OF THE WORLDS crap as a 
	          feature.
<b>	
</b>	Meantime, shelve the newsreel. No one cares
<b>	
</b><b>	INT SAN SIMEON. WELLES' SUITE EVENING
</b><b>	
</b>	Orson Welles, elegant and impressive, is flourishing a cigarette and a 
	coin in his magnificently expressive hands He is perfecting a magic 
	trick.
<b>	
</b>	Welles is lounging on the bed of an enormous guest suite at San Simeon. 
	He is wearing a tuxedo.
<b>	
</b>	In the bathroom beyond him we can see the writer HERMAN MANKIEWICZ 
<b>	("MANK". )
</b><b>	
</b>	Mank is a wonderful wreck of a human being. 43 years old, but looking 
	considerably older, he is short and squat and bitter. A compulsive 
	gambler and drinker, Mank still glimmers with wry humor that is equally 
	wicked and corrosive. He is incomplete without the stub of a cigar 
	clenched in his teeth.
<b>	
</b>	Mank, also dressed in a tuxedo, is looking at himself in the bathroom 
	mirror as he struggles with his bow tie. He occasionally glances in the 
	mirror to Welles.
<b>	
</b>	Title: JANUARY 3, 1940
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          I don't know what you expected with Joseph- 
	          fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is 
	          Hollywood, pal.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer 
	          and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap -
	          - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! -
	          - no one wants to see that.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES
</b>	          Nonsense
<b>	
</b>	Welles dramatically taps the cigarette on the coin, practicing his 
	trick as:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          What are movies about, Orson?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES
</b>	          Forget it-
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          What are movies about?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Telling stories.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK
</b>	          Nope.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Showing life
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to 
	          death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. 
	          They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
<b>	
</b>	Welles quickly makes the cigarette seem to completely pass through the 
	coin. An astounding bit of slight of hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	             (happily)
	           Magic
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You 
	          got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same 
	          job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You 
	          gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all 
	          about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES
</b>	          Not for me.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Then you better get ready to be the youngest never-
	          was in Hollywood history.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          That's better than being the oldest has-been in 
	          Hollywood history.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          You're a laugh-riot, kid.
<b>	
</b>	Welles laughs and goes to Mank in the bathroom.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Here, turn around.
<b>	
</b>	Welles ties Mank's bow tie for him as:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our

<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          We find the man and then we dissect him-

</b>	Mank takes a quick swig from a flask of vodka, shoves it into his coat 
	and scurries into the other room as Welles checks himself in the

<b>	
</b><b>	INT SAN SIMEON. HALLWAY FOLLOWING
</b><b>	
</b>
	Welles and Mank walk through an impressive upstairs hallway of San 
	Simeon. Quick glimpses of the astounding grandeur everywhere around 
	them as:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
<b>	
</b>	They disappear down a long stairway 
<b>	
</b><b>	INT SAN SIMEON. DINING HALL EVENING 
</b><b>	
</b>	An explosion of color and an immediate swirl of sound

<b>	
</b>	We are in the Grand Refectory -- the mammoth dining room -- at San 
	Simeon. Five long tables are placed end to end. There are about fifty 
	sumptuously dressed guests.
<b>	
</b>	WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST and MARION DAVIES preside, side by side, 
at the 
	center table.
<b>	
</b>	Hearst is 76 years old. He is a fully commanding figure, towering in 
	both height (six foot two) and personality. He is shaped rather like a 
	pear and moves with a delicacy surprising for such a famously merciless 
	man. Although the word ruthless does not begin to do justice to the 
	press baron's animus, Hearst is endlessly polite and almost painfully 
	soft-spoken.
<b>	
</b>	Marion is 43 years old, a shimmering and lively presence. In a word 
	that might have been coined for her, she has moxie. While the ravages 
	of alcoholism have left their subtle marks on the edges and attitudes 
	of her face, she can still charm and captivate with almost effortless 
	grace.
<b>	
</b>	Around Hearst's feet sit a collection of his beloved dachshunds.
<b>	
</b>	On the other side of the main table, and down a bit, sit Welles and 
	Mank.
<b>	
</b>	We sweep around the table, hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and 
	finally settle on Marion and Hearst.
<b>	
</b>	Marion is charming CAROLE LOMBARD and CLARK GABLE, who sit beside 
her. 
	She tenderly rests one hand on Hearst's arm as she speaks. Marion 
	speaks with an occasionally pronounced stutter.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MARION 
</b>	          And we would hear them scuttling around at night 
	          with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t-
	          teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all 
	          over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. 
	          And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung 
	          but no mice!
<b>	
</b><b>	                         CAROLE LOMBARD
</b>	          Houdini mice.
<b>	
</b>	Laughter
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MARION 
</b>	          Just wait. So one night I notice Pops getting outta 
	          bed and sneaking away. And he's got this little p-p-
	          paper bag with him, right? Middle of the night. So I 
	          figure the old man's really up to no good this time 
	          and I follow him. Well I'll be g-g-goddamned if he's 
	          not springing all the traps and leaving cheese for 
	          the rats!
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MARION 
</b>	          You and that freak Disney, in love with the damn 
	          rats!
<b>	
</b>	Laughter, even from Hearst
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HEARST 
</b>	          They really are sweet little things
<b>	
</b>	Meanwhile, across the table Welles is rapaciously devouring his dinner 
	as:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Sigmund Freud?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad 
	          and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you 
	          wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so 
	          goddamn smart.
<b>	
</b>	Mank surreptitiously pours a huge shot of vodka from his flask into his 
	glass as:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	             (suddenly inspired)
	           Manolete?!
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Who the hell's Manolete?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          The great Spanish bullfighter
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          I don't wanna write about no spic.

</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! 
	          False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have 
	          been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the 
	          days of lrving and Booth. (He flourishes his napkin 
	          like a bullfighter's cape.) Imagine me in a 
	          glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian 
	          plains--
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MARION 
</b>	          Why Mr. Welles is attempting semaphore
<b>	
</b>	Welles smiles across the table.
<b>	
</b>	Laughter.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

	           No, when I was but a tender lad--
<b>	
</b><b>	                         CAROLE LOMBARD 
</b>	          Last week would this be?
<b>	
</b>	Laughter. As Welles speaks the whole table gradually stops eating and 
	listens to his tale:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          My father and I made a tour of the grand boulevards 
	          of antique Europe. And when we were in Iberia I had 
	          the chance to face the bulls. At the knee of the 
	          great Manolete I took up the cape and sword - 
	             (he uses his napkin and knife to 
	             demonstrate)
	           -- across from me stood a mammoth bull reputed to 
	          have gored a full seven men to a grisly demise! So -
	          - with Manolete shouting encouragement I flourished 
	          . . . I flourished again . . . and the bull charged! 
	          Across the golden dust it came, thundering like the 
	          great minotaur of legend, closer, ever closer, its 
	          calamitous hooves pounding into the dirt, shaking 
	          the earth as I held the crimson eye of the bull with 
	          my own, defying it -- it was almost upon me and I 
	          flourished one last time! -- the monster swept past! 
<b>	          - 
</b>	             (he spins his napkin in the air and his 
	             knife is now gone, a magic trick)
	           -- and my sword was gone -- buried in the bloody 
	          eye of the beast!
<b>	
</b>	Applause and laughter from around the table. Then:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HEARST 
</b>	             (quietly)
	           You are evidently a man who knows a great deal 
	          about bull.
<b>	
</b>	Some nervous titters. A beat as Welles' smile fades and he stares at 
	Hearst.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HEARST 
</b>	          Of all man's malignity -- of all his sadism -- none 
	          is more depraved than cruelty to animals.
<b>	
</b>	Silence
<b>	
</b>	Mank gives Welles a desperate warning look to keep quiet Welles cannot 
	resist speaking:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          In Spain the cruelty would be in denying the beast 
	          a fighting end.
<b>	
</b>	A beat as Hearst rivets Welles with a cold, bland stare Deafening 
	silence around the table.
<b>	
</b>	Then:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HEARST

<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          I'll remember that.
<b>	
</b>	A tense beat. Marion quickly diffuses the situation;
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MARION 
</b>	          Enough Hollywood talk! Can't anyone talk about

	          Ooh, dish.
<b>	
</b>	Laughter. Even from Hearst. Then the dinner chatter continues.
<b>	
</b>	Welles cannot keep his eyes off Hearst, the press baron draws Welles in 
	like a siren.
<b>	
</b>	Marion gives Hearst a little kiss and grabs Carole Lombard and they 
	leave the table. Hearst leans into Clark Gable to continue talking.
<b>	
</b>	Welles sits back and reaches for a cigar. Mank takes his arm and 
	indicates he should stop, nodding his head in Hearst's direction.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	             (quietly)
	           The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is 
	          monstrous.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK

	          else in the world but he lives openly with his 
	          mistress.

<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Buddy, when you own the largest publishing empire

	          want. Think about it, pal. Every day one out of five 
	          Americans picks up a Hearst publication. 30 
	          newspapers, a dozen magazines, a bunch of radio 
	          stations and the grand dragon of them all. Little 
	          Miss Louella Parsons. Tends to give you some of that 
	          ol' noblesse oblige.

</b>	As Welles and Carole Lombard dance, Welles keeps an eye on Hearst and

</b><b>	INT SAN SIMEON. WELLES' SUITE NIGHT 
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles, again dressed in a tuxedo, lies on his bed
<b>	
</b>	Through the open balcony doors he can hear the eerie sound of lions 
	roaring and elephants trumpeting in the night.
<b>	
</b>	He stand and wanders to the balcony. Below him he can see bits and 
	pieces of Hearst's private zoo in the moonlight: a lion pacing 
	relentlessly back and forth; an alligator slipping into the water; a 
	monkey slamming into the bars of its cage.
<b>	
</b>	The disquieting sounds of the menagerie float through the midnight air.

</b>	Welles leaves his suite 
<b>	
</b><b>	INT SAN SIMEON. HALLWAYS FOLLOWING
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles roams the seemingly endless hallways of San Simeon. In the half-
	light they begin to resemble his own cinematic dream-palace, Xanadu.
<b>	
</b>	He hears the ghostly echo of a song, "WHERE OR WHEN".
<b>	
</b>	He curiously follows the sound, taking in the fabulous castle 
	everywhere around him.
<b>	
</b>	He passes by the door to the Assembly Room. Inside, shafts of light

</b>	Below him a phonograph record spins lazily on a turntable standing of 
	the floor of the deserted ballroom.
<b>	
</b>	And Hearst and Marion are enjoying a quiet dance together, her head

</b>	Welles stares and stares at them And slowly smiles. We linger on Hearst

</b><b>	EXT WELLES' HOUSE. POOL DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles, wrapped in a bathrobe, is pacing quickly around the perimeter 
	of his backyard pool. He is puffing on a cigar and grunting to himself 
	as he scribbles down notes.
<b>	
</b>	Mank, wearing sunglasses and a battered fedora and looking decidedly 
	hung-over, comes from the house to the pool.
<b>	
</b>	Welles roars up to him:

</b>	Mank takes a glass from a tray of orange juice and pours vodka from a

</b>	Welles blocks Mank's way. Mank retreats. Welles pursues him around the 
	pool as:

	          just another goddamn ACTOR!
<b>	
</b>	Welles shoves Mank violently. Mank goes sailing into the pool.
<b>	
</b>	Mank splashes to the surface and stands for a shocked moment and then 
	wades to the edge of the pool. Miraculously, and like the true drinker 
	he is, Mank is still holding his glass of juice and vodka, now 
	supplemented with pool water.
<b>	
</b>	Welles stands above him, blocking his exit from the pool. From this low 
	angle Welles suddenly looks startlingly Kane- like.

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          She was . . . innocent
<b>	
</b>	A beat, Welles deep in thought. Mank watches Welles closely.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          So when was our man innocent? Was there a moment 
	          early on -- of innocence and bliss? There must have 
	          been. Okay, you're dying - what do you think?
<b>	
</b>	Welles does not answer. He continues to bounce the tennis ball, deep in 
	thought.
<b>	
</b>	A beat
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK

	          Something you lost maybe?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Something you can never get back?
<b>	
</b>	Mank watches as Welles lets the tennis ball drop. It bounces and rolls 
	-- for a fleeting moment in Welles' mind  it seems to become the rolling 
	snow globe from KANE -- we hear the sound of sleigh bells and a child's 
	happy voice -- in the snow globe we seem to see a boy laughing and 
	pelting his father with snowballs. . .
<b>	
</b>	Then more images, mad and outlandish and sedate and solemn; in the 
	kitchen, in a car, around the pool, in a bar.
<b>	
</b>	Welles and Mank act out scenes and argue. They leap from character to 
	character fearlessly. Emoting and laughing and writing. We see the twin 
	joy and terror of walking the tightrope, of sheer creation.
<b>	
</b>	We see them having a ferocious argument. They scream back and forth 
	angrily and then Mank storms out and slams the door. Welles stands 
	alone in his living room, he catches a glimpse of his own reflection in 
	a mirror and we hear:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK'S VOICE 
</b>	          Men like Hearst don't love..
<b>	
</b>	Welles' living room: Welles is slowly advancing on Mank.
<b>	
</b>	Mank sits, watching Welles approach. The living room is now filthy. 
	Papers and sketches and gin bottles are discarded everywhere around 
	them, a thick cloud of cigar smoke. It is very late at night and the 
	room is in semi-darkness.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't 
	          bother with convention because--
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          They don't have to.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because 
	          those are the only conditions he has ever known.
<b>	
</b>	Welles is now standing over Mank, a dark figure in silhouette. Mank 
	soaks in this somewhat ominous image.
<b>	
</b>	More music and images: eating and working; swimming and working; 
	playing and working simultaneously.
<b>	
</b>	Then: Beach:
<b>	
</b>	Sunset. We see them walking along a deserted beach Welles is walking in 
	the surf, his trousers rolled.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	             (quietly)
	          Hearst looks down at the world at his feet 
	          Everything has always been beneath him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          And what does he see?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          The people. When they pay him homage, he adores 
	          them. But when they have the ... audacity to 
	          question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then 
	          he despises them.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
<b>	
</b><b>	31
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles stops and looks up. A thousand stars twinkle above him. They are 
	reflected in his eyes.
<b>	
</b>	A long pause as he does not answer Mank Then
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          I'm ready to write it, Orson

</b>	Mank and John Houseman are ensconced in a bungalow at Campbell's Guest 
	Ranch, writing the movie.
<b>	
</b>	Mank, smoking a cigar, paces around the cacti and shrubs in the 
	backyard reciting to their secretary. She pounds away on a typewriter 
	as he orates. A huge stack of papers lies neatly by her typewriter. 
	This is clearly the longest screenplay in the history of the world.

	for a table with some elaborate set models. He is;' slowly walking 
	around the models, studying them, imagining' his movie.
<b>	
</b>	The sound stage door opens and a man enters, carrying a small black 
	bag. He is cinematographer GREGG TOLAND.
<b>	
</b>	Toland is a quiet, efficient and slim man of 36. He is brilliant and

<b>	
</b>	Toland walks to Welles and, without a word, pulls an Oscar statue out

</b><b>	INT THE BROWN DERBY DAY\NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	The chic Brown Derby restaurant is the unquestioned palace of Hollywood 
	celebrities. The smug big-wigs and desperate hangers-on circulate and 
	score points in the Great Game of Movie Gossip.
<b>	
</b>	In one corner booth sits Hedda Hopper, phoning in the latest salacious 
	gossip to her newspaper. In the other corner booth Louella Parsons does 
	the same. They occasionally glance back and forth at each other like 
	ravenous hyenas eyeing the last bit of carrion.
<b>	
</b>	Welles circulates between them. In a scene reminiscent of the famous 
	CITIZEN KANE breakfast table scene with Kane and Emily, we shoot back 
	and forth as Welles applies his considerable charm to both women.
<b>	
</b>	Welles is dressed differently with each of them; breakfast with Hedda 
	and dinner with Louella.
<b>	
</b>	With Hedda, morning:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES (CONT.)

</b>	Mank leans against the door in stunned exhaustion. Then he slides down

	Silent.

<b>	
</b><b>	                         MARION

</b><b>	
</b>	Welles paces before Schaefer's massive desk with typical combustible

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

</b>	A long pause as Welles leans against a wall, his head down He does not 
	look at Schaefer as:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	             (simply)

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

<b>	
</b>	And I honestly can't think of a reason in the world why you should let

<b>	
</b>	A long pause as Schaefer studies Welles. Then
<b>	
</b><b>	                         SCHAEFER

</b>	Then he nods to Schaefer and begins to leave.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         SCHAEFER

</b><b>	EXT SOUND STAGE. RKO LOT DAWN
</b><b>	
</b>	The sun is just rising on the RKO lot. We note a sign on the wall by 
	the sound stage door:

	the stage and giant lighting rigs and scaffolding soar to the unseen 
	ceiling miles away.

</b>	The Xanadu Great Hall set awaits.

</b>	Welles slowly walks to the set and stands, surveying his domain, 
	savoring the moment.

</b>	Title: JULY 30, 1940
<b>	
</b>	He clears his throat and speaks, rehearsing his first day speech to the 
	cast and crew. His voice echoes.

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES' VOICE 
</b>	          Together we will throw away all the maps and we

	          the future cartographers of Hollywood will forever 
	          chart our course. Following our lead...
<b>	
</b>	We continue to ascend and finally discover two electricians on the 
	upper catwalk, staring down in amusement, much like the two stagehands 
	at the opera in KANE.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES' VOICE 
</b>	          And do you know why we're going to do this?

<b>	
</b>	Above, one of the electrician's throws the switch on a huge spotlight.
<b>	
</b>	Welles is captured in the vibrant white light and Benny Goodman's 
	immortal "SING, SING, SING" immediately explodes and we are into:
<b>	
</b><b>	THE MAKING OF CITIZEN KANE
</b><b>	
</b>	A camera crane sweeps dramatically to the ceiling of the sound stage 
	and brilliant white lights flash on.
<b>	
</b>	A film clapper snaps: CITIZEN KANE. RKO PRODUCTION 281 DIRECTOR: 
<b>ORSON 
</b><b>	WELLES.
</b><b>	
</b>	And we see Welles racing heroically into making his first movie:
<b>	
</b>	In varying KANE makeups he tears through scenes and actors: laughing 
	with AGNES MOOREHEAD on the cabin set; charming RUTH WARRICK on 
the 

	breakfast table set; berating DOROTHY COMMINGORE on the Great Hall 
	set...
<b>	
</b>	He speeds back and forth and back and forth from the set to the camera 
	in the Campaign Headquarters set, never happy with the shot. . .
<b>	
</b>	Gregg Toland watches, bemused, as Welles shifts tiny prop pieces on the 
	set. . .
<b>	
</b>	Welles bullies and screams and pleads and seduces. Like an obsessed 
	artistic tornado he is seemingly everywhere at once. We see him 
	rejecting matte paintings and in makeup and rewriting the script and 
	trying on costumes and selecting props and leaping into odd positions 
	looking for the perfect camera angle.
<b>	
</b>	It is very important in this sequence that we see the pressure building 
	... building ... building ... on Welles.
<b>	
</b>	"SING, SING, SING" continues On the Xanadu stairway set Welles behind 
	the camera, filming actor Paul Stewart

<b>	
</b>	in a corner of the sound stage:
<b>	
</b>	Welles, in full Kane makeup, studies a miniature model of the Kane 
	Campaign Headquarters set through a tiny periscope with cinematographer 
	Gregg Toland.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

	the Atlantic City nightclub set:
<b>	
</b>	Welles watches as the camera crane attempts the dizzying and difficult 
	maneuver from the skylight at the top of the set
<b>	
</b>	down to Dorothy Commingore as Susan Alexander below. The camera crane 
	goes out of control and crashes through some light fixtures and swings 
	crazily down toward Dorothy Commingore. She yelps and leaps away as the 
	camera barrels through the table and smashes to the floor.
<b>

<b>	
</b>	"SING, SING, SING" continues. Back on the, Xanadu stairway set
<b>	
</b>	Paul Stewart, dazed and shattered, is listening intently. Welles stands 
	with his arms around Stewart, embracing him, whispering into his ear.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          It is the most important line of the picture. You 
	          will weave the magic of "Rosebud" in a single word -
	          - you will say the word in such a way as to impart 
	          to us the mystery of it. It is a divine and sinister 
	          mystery worthy only of your talent. In this one word 
	          the movie soars or falls. Once more, I beg you.
<b>	
</b>	Stewart nods. The film clapper: take 178.
<b>	
</b>	The cameraman leans into the viewfinder. We see his black- and-white 
	view of the shot through the lens then:
<b>	
</b>	In a cramped editing room we see Welles watching the scene on an old 
	editing moviola.
<b>	
</b>	On the moviola we see Paul Stewart taking a deep breath and then, 
	magnificently:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         PAUL STEWART

<b>	
</b>	On the moviola we see Stewart laugh hysterically and dance away.

<b>	
</b>	"SING, SING, SING" continues. On the Campaign Headquarters set:
<b>	
</b>	Welles and Toland lie on the floor of the Campaign Headquarters set and 
	gaze up through viewfinders. They squirm about on the floor and laugh 
	to one another about their newest outlandish idea.
<b>	
</b>	Then Toland notices something in the catwalks high above the set. A 
	redheaded ELECTRICIAN.
<b>	
</b>	                         TOLAND Orson, you see that electrician up there? The redhead. 
He was 
	on GRAPES OF WRATH. He's a free- lance studio spy. Probably reports 
	right back to the RKO boys in New York.
<b>	
</b>	Welles slowly stands and THUNDERS:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b><b>	          STOP EVERYBODY STOP!
</b><b>	
</b>	All the flurried activity on the sound stage immediately stops.
<b>	
</b>	Every eye turns, terrified, to Welles. Welles glares up at the 
	redheaded electrician
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b><b>	          YOU COME DOWN HERE!

	every step of the way.
<b>

</b><b>	                         ELECTRICIAN 
</b>	          Mr. Welles...?
<b>	
</b>	A tense beat and then Welles fiercely and purposefully spits in the 
	electrician's face.
<b>	
</b>	The electrician recoils, stunned.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b><b>	          GET OUT
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles returns to Toland as the electrician slinks off "SING, SING, 
	SING" continues as:
<b>	
</b>	We see the magnificent film emerging. Welles watching scenes in a 
	screening room, his feet up, exhausted, almost asleep, a cigar dangling 
	from his lips...
<b>	
</b>	We see rushes of Welles going through scenes with Dorothy Commingore as 
	Susan Alexander. He is relentless with her off camera, driving her to 
	the harridan outbursts he wants just before he steps into the shot...
<b>	
</b>	We see the crew observing, with great amusement, Welles' stumbling 
	attempts to learn the "Charlie Kane" dance...
<b>	
</b>	We see Toland shifting lights to achieve deep-focus cross-fades. Welles 
	rages as the difficult process eats up time...
<b>	
</b>	We see Welles growing increasingly manic. The long hours and the 
	pressure are clearly taking a toll..
<b>	
</b>	We return to the screening room. Welles is now fully asleep. His cigar 
	falls from his mouth and begins smoldering on his suit.
<b>	
</b>	"SING, SING, SING" fades at... On a Xanadu set:
<b>	
</b>	Filming a scene. Welles, in old-Kane makeup, is sitting with Dorothy 
	Commingore as Susan Alexander. He is curiously distracted. She is 
	pouring tea in the scene:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         DOROTHY COMMINGORE 
</b>	          "Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking 
	          at things . "
<b>	
</b>	Welles does not respond. He breaks character
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          No -- no -- I'll pour the tea. Sorry. I should pour 
	          the tea. Let's try that again.
<b>	
</b>	Toland stands behind the camera and watches Welles. There is obviously 
	something wrong.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Okay, here we go... Set. Action
<b>	
</b>	Welles pops into character and pours the tea in the scene as:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         DOROTHY COMMINGORE 
</b>	          "Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking 
	          at things . "
<b>	
</b>	Welles stops, breaks character again:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          No -- that's not right
<b>	
</b>	He clears his throat and glances at the enormous crew, all staring back 
	at him expectantly.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Urn. . . ah . . . yes -- you should definitely pour 
	          the tea. Okay, again. Sorry.... Set. Action.
<b>	
</b>	They start the scene again. She pours the tea
<b>	
</b><b>	                         DOROTHY COMMINGORE 
</b>	          "Charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking 
	          at things . "
<b>	
</b>	A pause as she waits for his reply in the scene He sits, frozen.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         TOLAND 
</b>	          Orson, you wanna take five?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
<b>	
</b>	He slowly walks off the set as he nervously pulls at his tie, tearing 
	it off.
<b>	
</b>	Toland watches him go. 
<b>	
</b><b>	INT BROWN DERBY DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Louella is at her usual corner booth, on the phone to one of her many

</b>	She hangs up, intrigued.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT WELLES' HOUSE 
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles is standing, absolutely lost, in the middle of his living room. 
	He is still in his old-Kane makeup which is just beginning to peel off 
	his face.
<b>	
</b>	We hear a low, insistent drum beat, a Gene Krupa riff.
<b>	
</b>	We hear the sound of an ice pick chipping into a block of ice. Welles 
	glances around. We are no longer in Welles' living room but at. . .
<b>	
</b><b>	INT MANK'S HOUSE. SANTA MONICA DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A turntable spins in a corner, playing a Gene Krupa record. Ashtrays 
	overflow with cigar butts and messy piles of pages are littered around 

	a typewriter.
<b>	
</b>	Mank's beach house is tiny and on the edge of squalid
<b>	
</b>	Welles, still in his peeling old-Kane makeup, is standing in the middle 
	of the living room and Mank is in the small kitchenette, chipping ice 
	for drinks.
<b>	
</b>	A long pause
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking

<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK
</b>	          Uh huh.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          I just can't . . see it anymore
<b>	
</b>	Mank returns to the living room and thrusts a drink in Welles hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          I want you back
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Fuck you. (He sits.) You wanted me out. I'm out.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES
</b>	          I'm sorry.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK
</b>	          I don't care.
<b>	
</b>	Welles hands Mank a folded script from his jacket. Mank looks at it as:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          This is the shooting script we've been using every 
	          day.
<b>	
</b>	Sure enough, the title page of the script reads: CITIZEN KANE by Herman 
	J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          It's just like we always said it would be
<b>	
</b>	Mank hands it back
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          Too late, kid.
<b>	
</b>	Welles sits.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Did I ever tell you about my father?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          I don't give a shit about-
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was 
	          ashamed of him.
<b>	
</b>	A beat. Welles proceeds quietly and with difficulty.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          He showed me the world, he took me with him 
	          everywhere -- Europe, China -- and he was so proud 
	          of me. But he would drink and he would get 
	          ...embarrassing. And I began to resent him Because I 
	          was so ... sparkling, you see.
<b>	
</b>	So I cut him dead. I turned my back and I walked away because I didn't 
	need him. He was getting in the way of my "genius." And he would write 
	me letters, and I never answered them, and he would call me, and I 
	never took his calls, and he showed up at school and I wouldn't see 
	him.
<b>	
</b>	Tears are beginning to inch down Welles' face
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          When I finally saw him again, he was in a coffin. I 
	          was fifteen. And all of a sudden he wasn't that 
	          embarrassing drunk anymore ... he was the man who 
	          showed me the world.
<b>	
</b>	Welles looks up at Mank, tears now streaming down his face.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Just like you, Mank.
<b>	
</b>	A long beat. Mank, despite himself, is moved.

<b>	
</b>	To cover his emotion Mank rises and goes into the kitchen to freshen 
	his drink. We remain tight on Welles as we hear Mank's voice:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK'S VOICE 
</b>	          So you've lost it? Don't know who should pour the 
	          tea.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES
</b>	          Yeah
<b>	
</b>	A beat
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK'S VOICE 
</b>	          Orson ... just cut the goddamn tea
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES
</b>	          Okay
<b>	
</b>	A beat. Welles reaches for a cigar, tears still wet on his face.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK'S VOICE 
</b>	          I been thinking about the beach scene. You done 
	          that yet?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES
</b><b>	
</b>	No
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK'S VOICE 
</b>	          Good -- cause I was thinking that we're starting 
	          the scene too late...
<b>	
</b>	Welles quickly bites off the end of his cigar -- his expression one of 
	"Gotcha!" -- even as. his cheeks are still wet with tears.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK'S VOICE (CONT.) 
</b>	          Cause if we don't show Susan watching Kane more 
	          then we're not building the right tension into the 
	          scene. See, she's gotta know that...
<b>	
</b>	Welles slowly smiles as the record of Gene Krupa's percussion segues 
	into the unmistakable rhythms of "SING, SING, SING" and eclipses Mank's 
	voice...
<b>	
</b>	And we see Welles everywhere, more energized than ever: perilous on a 
	high crane; stuck in a cramped corner behind the camera; doing magic 
	tricks for the cast; sleeping as makeup is applied to his face...
<b>	
</b>	Mank is always at Welles' side: supporting; challenging; amusing; 
	inspiring. . .
<b>	
</b>	We see Welles strutting, raging, boasting, dancing. And again towering.
<b>	
</b>	"SING, SING, SING" finally ends at..
<b>	
</b>	Through the black-and-white viewfinder we see Welles, in full costume 
	and makeup, carefully walking across the massive Kane Campaign 
	Headquarters set toward us. We see the low angle black-and-white 
	camera's perspective.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         TOLAND'S VOICE 
</b>	          Closer ... closer ... closer -- stop. We just lost 
	          your head.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Can you see my shoes?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         TOLAND'S VOICE 
</b>	          Yeah, but we lose your head.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Goddamn it Joe -- stand here
<b>	
</b>	JOSEPH COTTON, also in full costume and makeup, steps into the shot and 
	takes Welles' position as Welles scurries out of the frame. . ..
<b>	
</b><b>	INT SOUND STAGE. RKO NIGHT. FOLLOWING
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles marches across the set and squirms into position at the camera, 
	which is right on the floor, and peers up through the viewfinder.
<b>	
</b>	Toland lies next to him. Mank stands to one side and- watches.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We 
	          have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring 
	          to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
<b>	
</b><b>	                         TOLAND 
</b>	          Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          I need my shoes in total focus right here and also 
	          Joe back there--!
<b>	
</b><b>	                         TOLAND 
</b>	          I know what you want but it can't be done!
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a 
	          few more inches down and then tilt up--
<b>	
</b><b>	                         TOLAND 
</b>	          Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any 
	          fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
<b>	
</b>	Welles thinks for a moment and then bolts up. Toland watches, 
	mystified, as Welles races to a sound stage fire station and grabs a 
	fire axe. Welles storms back to the set and raises the axe high. Toland 
	quickly rolls away. And Welles slams the axe into the wooden floor of 
	the set. He continues to hack at the floor.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Come on, Gregg! We'll tear out this floor!
<b>	
</b>	Welles and Toland and various grips hack at the floor
<b>	
</b>	Mank watches, bemused, and checks his watch
<b>	
</b>	Welles and Toland finally tear away the remnants of the wooden floor. 
	They stare down, defeated. Under the wood is solid concrete.
<b>	
</b>	Welles and Toland stand and stare at the concrete
<b>	
</b><b>	                         TOLAND 
</b>	          It's midnight, why don't we pick it up tomorrow?
<b>	
</b>	Welles does not answer. He continues to eye the concrete Then:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Get me a jackhammer.
<b>	
</b>	We see a grip pounding away at the concrete with a jackhammer as 
	Welles, always in motion, sweeps past Mank and Joseph Cotton.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	             (wryly, to Cotton)
	          There but for the grace of God, goes God.
<b>	
</b>	Welles slams to a halt in front of the unit physician and thrusts out 
	an arm. The physician injects him with a dose of B-12.
<b>	
</b>	Welles can barely wait for the injection before he speeds off.
<b>	
</b>	Welles supervises as Toland lowers the camera into the freshly dug hole 
	in the middle of the sound stage. Mank checks his watch, 3:30 AM.
<b>	
</b>	Welles leaps into the trench to check the camera setup.
<b>	
</b>	Again we see the view through the black-and-white viewfinder. Joseph 
	Cotton stands at a distance, at the far wall of the set.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES' VOICE 
</b>	          Okay, Joe . . . come closer . . . closer
<b>	
</b>	We see Cotton approaching. He finally stops inches away from the 
	camera. His shoes and the far wall of the set are both in total focus. 
	It is a breathtaking, vertiginous shot.
<b>	
</b>	Then we see Welles and Joseph Cotton rehearsing and rehearsing and 
	filming and filming the scene. Endlessly
<b>	
</b>	Finally we seem to be seeing the scene from the movie
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          "Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss 
	          Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've 
	          set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All 
	          right, if that's the way they want it, the people 
	          have made their choice. It's obvious the people 
	          prefer Jim Gettys to me."
<b>	
</b><b>	                         JOSEPH COTTON 
</b>	          "You talk about the people as if you owned them. As

	          remember, you've talked about--" (he breaks 
	          character)
	          Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
<b>	
</b>	We continue to watch the scene through the viewfinder:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	             (to the camera operator)
	          Keep filming.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         JOSEPH COTTON

</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
<b>	
</b>	He shoves Joseph Cotton brutally
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. 
	          Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
<b>	
</b><b>	                         JOSEPH COTTON 
</b>	          We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some

<b>	
</b>	Welles shoves him again.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

	          Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his 
	          own."
<b>	
</b>	Welles/Kane drinks. A long pause.

</b><b>	                         WELLES

<b>	
</b>	We jump out of the black-and-white viewfinder and into the scene as 
	Welles turns to an assistant.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

</b><b>	                         WELLES
</b>	          Yeah. 
<b>	
</b>	The crew members exhale and practically collapse
<b>	
</b>	Welles stands and looks around in satisfaction. He takes in the empty 
	corners of the sound stage, the sets, the cameras Savoring the moment.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	             (quietly)
	          It's finished.
<b>

	          Let me tell you a story, son  So this was 1924, 
	          right? Hearst was throwing a birthday party for 
	          Thomas Ince, the old movie producer. They were all 
	          on the old man's yacht taking a nice jaunt from 
	          Pedro down to San Diego. Real foggy night it was. 
	          This was Hearst, Marion, Ince, Charlie Chaplin, 
	          Louella, the usual gorillas. So Hearst notices 
	          Marion slip off with Chaplin -- she was screwing 
	          everyone then -- and the old man goes nuts. Grabs 
	          his revolver and starts shooting. Just like Tom Mix, 
	          standing there blasting away through the fog. Boom -
	          - boom -- boom -- and Thomas Ince takes a bullet 
	          through the head. So now there's this dead guy lying 
	          on the deck. You'll see how this could be quite an 
	          embarrassment. So the empire goes into action. Nice 
	          and quiet and Ince was cremated lickety-split. No 
	          inquest and no police. It was right after this that 
	          Hearst gives Louella her life-time contract. Just to 
	          keep her all hush-hush.

<b>	
</b>	Welles suddenly FLINGS his plate of food in Schaefer's direction as he 
<b>	ROARS:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

</b><b>	
</b>	And in a screaming, bellowing fury, Welles tears apart the room.
<b>	
</b>	In a scene sharply reminiscent of Kane destroying Susan's bedroom, 
	Welles rampages around the room, upsetting tables and smashing 
	everything in reach.
<b>	
</b>	Welles finally grabs a flaming can of sterno and flings it at Schaefer, 
	Schaefer knocks it away.
<b>	
</b>	Then Welles stands in spent exhaustion, panting. One of his hands is 
	bleeding.
<b>	
</b>	He looks at Schaefer. A pause. Then:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES

<b>	
</b><b>	INT.   GIMBELS NEW YORK  DAY 
</b><b>	
</b>	The entire two-acre fifth floor of Gimbels is in chaos
<b>	
</b>	A large banner is suspended at one end of the floor; "The Hearst 
	Collection." It is the first day of the sale and it is mobbed.
<b>	
</b>	Hearst and Marion, alone in a crowd, walk wordlessly through the 
	mayhem.
<b>	
</b>	Everywhere around them hundreds of eager customers strike like hawks, 
	snatching up useless junk and treasured antiques.
<b>	
</b>	We see bits and pieces of San Simeon in the jumble
<b>	
</b>	They pass a man and his wife, holding up Marion's -BLESS THIS CASTLE" 
	sampler:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MAN 
</b>	          Old man Hearst owned this and I'm getting it for 
	          two bits I
<b>	
</b>	Hearst and Marion continue to walk, finally arriving at the section 
	containing the true, expensive treasures.
<b>	
</b>	Hearst watches as customers pick up and fondle his life.
<b>	
</b>	He glances at a framed front page of the San Francisco Examiner. The 
	date is March 4, 1887. In a large box on the page is: "IT IS THE ROLE 
<b>	OF THE PRESS TO COMFORT THE AFFLICTED AND AFFLICT THE 
</b><b>COMFORTABLE. 
</b><b>	WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST. PUBLISHER."
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                         HEARST 
</b>	          I can't sell this. How much are they asking?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         MARION 
</b>	             (gently)
	          Pops ... let it go. Just ... let it go
<b>	
</b>	He looks at her. A long moment. He tenderly touches her face.
<b>	
</b>	Then: 
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HEARST 
</b>	          Yes, I think I shall.
<b>	
</b>	He takes her hand and leads her away as we pull up and take in the 
	entire fifth floor.
<b>	
</b>	It is a stunning KANE-like image of rows and rows of merchandise piled 
	high. Of junk and jewels. Of Charles Foster Kane and William Randolph 
	Hearst.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT HOTEL ROOM. NEW YORK NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles sits brooding in his hotel room. His invincible energy appears 
	gone.
<b>	
</b>	He is deep in thought, listlessly shuffling and reshuffling a deck of 
	cards in one hand.
<b>	
</b>	He aimlessly shuffles through the cards and plucks one out.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Six of spades
<b>	
</b>	He glances at the card. It is the nine of hearts.
<b>	
</b>	He shuffles through the cards again and pulls out another card.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Six of spades
<b>	
</b>	He looks at the card. It is the two of clubs.
<b>	
</b>	His attention is now fully on the cards. He shuffles them dramatically 
	and snatches out a card. He looks at it and then tosses it away. He 
	shuffles again, working the trick, again it fails. He tosses another 
	card away. He continues, ;' more quickly, to attempt the trick. It 
	fails again. And ' again.
<b>	
</b>	With a frightened moan Welles flings the entire deck away from him and 
	bolts out of the room...
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT HOTEL ROOFTOP NIGHT 
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles emerges from a stairway on the roof of his hotel.
<b>	
</b>	He marches to the edge of the roof and leans against a railing, gasping 
	for air.
<b>	
</b>	Everywhere below him the shimmering lights of Manhattan twinkle and 
	flash; cabs and neon and noise. The night sky above him is filled with 
	stars.
<b>	
</b>	He looks away from the city and up to the stars -- they captivate him 
	fully. He stares and stares at the impossible chaos of beautiful 
	lights.
<b>	
</b>	A long moment as Welles gazes at the stars. The city below and the 
	noise seem to disappear and Welles stands, safe and at peace under the 
	silent dome of stars.
<b>	
</b>	The stars are reflected in his huge, dark eyes
<b>	
</b>	Magically, the stars in his eyes give way to the vague shapes of men 
	sitting around a table.
<b>	
</b>	Welles looks at the men.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Today.
<b>	
</b>	We pull back to see we are at 
<b>	
</b><b>	INT RKO BOARD ROOM. NEW YORK DAY 
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles stands at the head of a long conference table. Title: APRIL 6, 
<b>	1941
</b><b>	
</b>	Around the table are gathered a group of stern businessmen Schaefer is 
	also present.
<b>	
</b>	Welles looks at the men. And he speaks. For once, his usual 
	overwrought, theatrical tones are gone.
<b>	
</b>	He speaks simply.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Today a man from Germany invaded Greece. He has 
	          already swallowed Poland and Denmark and Norway and 
	          Belgium. He is bombing London as I speak. Everywhere 
	          this man goes he crushes the life and the freedom of 
	          his subjects. He sews yellow stars onto their 
	          lapels. He takes their voices.
<b>	
</b>	In this country we still have our voices. And we can sing with them. 
	And we can argue with them. And we can be heard. Because we are . . . 
	for the moment . . . free. No one can tell us what to say or how to say 
	it, can they? We have no brown shirt thugs here ruling our lives, do 
	we? No one can take our voices, can they? Because we are free.
<b>	
</b>	I am one voice and that is all. My picture is one voice. Men are dying 
	in Europe now -- and Americans soon will be -- so that we can surmount 
	the tyrants and the dictators. Will you send a message across this 
	country that one man can take away our voices?
<b>	
</b>	So ... who is Mr. Hearst and who is Mr. Welles? Mr. Hearst built a 
	palace of brick and mortar and starting little wars and corpses piled 
	high. I built a palace of illusion. My castle Xanadu is a matte 
	painting and camera trick. It's nothing but . . . a dream.
<b>	
</b>	Today you have a chance to let the dream triumph. For once.
<b>	
</b>	He gazes at them and then slowly walks out of the room 
<b>	
</b><b>	INT LONG HALLWAY. NEW YORK DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Welles sits quietly on a bench in a long hallway in a tall building.
<b>	
</b>	Schaefer emerges from an office and goes to him. He sits next to him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         SCHAEFER 
</b>	          We open on May 1st.
<b>	
</b>	Welles slowly nods.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         SCHAEFER 
</b>	          Orson, what you said in there. Did you mean it?
<b>	
</b>	Welles looks at him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Does it matter? They believed it
<b>	
</b>	He stands and begins walking away.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         SCHAEFER 
</b>	          Orson.
<b>	
</b>	Welles stops, not turning.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         SCHAEFER 
</b>	          Yes. It matters.
<b>	
</b>	Welles continues down the hall 
<b>	
</b><b>	INT HOTEL. NEW YORK NIGHT 
</b><b>	
</b>	Title: APRIL 30, 1941 Welles is rushing to catch an elevator as the 
	doors close
<b>	
</b>	He nips in at the last minute and punches his button. He turns.
<b>	
</b>	The elevator is deserted but for one other person: William Randolph 
	Hearst.
<b>	
</b>	Welles and Hearst recognize each other instantly. As the elevator 
	ascends the two men look at each other.
<b>	
</b>	A very long pause as we watch their faces -- the young man and the old 
	man -- both men of mad grandeur and malevolent passion and stunning 
	inspiration -- both men of incalculable achievement and measureless 
	poignancy.
<b>	
</b>	Finally:
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Mr. Hearst, we've met once before, my name is Orson 
	          Welles and I've got a movie opening tomorrow night 
	          at the Palace. I would be pleased to get you 
	          tickets.
<b>	
</b>	A pause as Hearst regards Welles.
<b>	
</b>	Then Hearst carefully reaches over and presses the stop button on the 
	elevator. The elevator stops.
<b>	
</b>	An exceedingly quiet exchange:
<b>	
</b>	A beat.
<b>	
</b>	A pause.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HEARST 
</b>	          I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES
</b>	          Do you?
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HEARST 
</b>	          Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my 
	          head I could give you a hundred others. I have been 
	          swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a 
	          belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, 
	          undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private 
	          lives should not be public property.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name 
	          and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. 
	          In your papers you taught the world how to look 
	          under every rock. I learned at the knee of the 
	          master.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         HEARST 
</b>	          So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind 
	          of sad future are we two making? A future where men 
	          will do anything to sell their newspapers and their 
	          movies? A future where no price is too high for fame 
	          and power? When we will all scratch each other to 
	          pieces just to be heard?
<b>	
</b>	Can you truly envision such ... horror.
<b>	
</b>	Hearst presses the stop button again and the elevator begins to move.
<b>	
</b>	The doors opens on Hearst's floor and he leaves the elevator.
<b>	
</b>	The doors are about to shut on Welles when he leans forward; and roars: 
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b><b>	          CHARLES FOSTER KANE WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED I

</b>	The doors shut on Welles and we remain with Hearst as he slowly walks 
	down the long hotel hallway.
<b>	
</b>	He walks with dignity. 
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT PALACE THEATER. NEW YORK NIGHT 
</b><b>	
</b>	It is the premiere of CITIZEN KANE, at last.
<b>	
</b>	The Palace Theater swarms with tuxedos and dress gowns as the elite of 
	New York and Hollywood descend from limousines and slowly parade into 
	the packed lobby.
<b>	
</b>	On the Palace marquee "ORSON WELLES" is spelled out in enormous six 
	foot tall electric letters. Below that is "CITIZEN KANE" also in 
	electric letters. Above the marquee is a series of towering, flashing 
	neon Charles Foster Kanes and the words "IT'S TERRIFIC."

</b><b>	
</b>	We swirl with the throng of patrons in the lobby as they file into the

	in a corner of the lobby.
<b>	
</b>	They are studiously ignored and snubbed by all the movie people

</b>	A beat. Mank takes a drink.

</b><b>	                         MANK 
</b>	          I'll tell ya something, kid. When you make your 
	          masterpiece at 26 it's a bitch. I mean. where do you 
	          go from here?
<b>	
</b>	A long pause
<b>	
</b>	Then Welles speaks, softly.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Will burn. Burn up. Burn out.  But oh, what a flame
<b>	
</b>	He looks at Mank and toasts.
<b>	
</b><b>	                         WELLES 
</b>	          Cheers.
<b>	
</b>	And Orson Welles smiles. Indomitable.
<b>	
</b><b>	THE END.
