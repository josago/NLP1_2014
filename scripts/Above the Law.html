</b><b>1   TITLES SEQUENCE - MONTAGE WITH SCORE
</b>
    PHOTOGRAPHIC STILLS show us NICOLA TOSCANI as a city boy in
    various growing-up SHOTS, circa 1950's -- with street chums
    wearing a Wyatt Earp T-shirt, in a communion suit. Then:
    in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he
    grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his
    name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then:
    Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters,
    being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese
    martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a
    few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security
    clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them.
    Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON
    FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END.

<b>                                              DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>2   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
</b>    Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT
    CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH.
    SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage
    whips in the fierce downdraft as --
<b>3   "HUEY" GUNSHIP
</b>    with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper
    lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the
    wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several
    machine gun positions around the LZ.
<b>4   EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY
</b>    watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico
    and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary
    jungle attire that usually marks a CIA "spook."

<b>5   HELICOPTER
</b>    touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in
    their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags
    -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the
    ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before.

<b>6   LEADER OF THREE
</b>
    wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45.

                  before?

     Nico's eyes stay on the approaching "cowboy," KURT ZAGON,
     for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity.

                  from a page that ain't on the map.
<b>10   EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>     Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical
     Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail.
     We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader
     and totally at home   in the jungle.
<b>11   TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>     snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and
     let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.
<b>                                ZAGON

     The group continues along the ridge.

</b><b>12   EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</b>
     The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks.
<b>13   NICO
</b>
     listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back
     at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette.
<b>                                ZAGON
</b>                  What are you looking at, hotshot?

</b>                         (indicates cigarette
                          glow)
                  Why don't you light a bonfire?

</b><b>                                                         3.
</b>
     Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke.
<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               Just drive the taxi, ace.

     As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say,
     "Don't fuck with these guys."

<b>14   EXT. CAMBODIAN BASE CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
     A pocket-fortified position. Armed Cambodian lookouts,
     several hooches, radio equipment. Nico leads the party in
     through the perimeter. Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen
     100 of them. Fox indicates a hooch.
<b>                             FOX
</b>                      (to Zagon)
               They're in there.

     The three CIT men start for the hooch. Nico casts a concerned
     glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell.
<b>                             NICO
</b>               I don't trust these yo-yo's.
<b>15   FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP
</b>     We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position
     to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him
     ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.

<b>16   DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO
</b>     hears a SOUND, looks back toward the hooch.
<b>17   NICO'S POV - HOOCH
</b>     Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in-
     coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian
     guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can be
     heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside
     gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect.

<b>18   BACK TO NICO
</b>     He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the
     hooch.

<b>19   INT. HOOCH - CLOSE ON RICKETY CARD TABLE - NIGHT
</b>     on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials
     and surgical instruments. Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic,
     squirt-tests it.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          4.
</b>
<b>20   TWO ASIAN PRISONERS
</b>     are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon
     tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the
     hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves in, grabs the
     first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first
     prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing.
     Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.

<b>                               ZAGON
</b>                 That's the nice thing about modern
                 technology. You don't have to wait
                 for results.

     He moves close to the first prisoner.
<b>                               ZAGON
</b>                        (to first prisoner)
                 Where is it, Charley? You got six tons
                 of our shit --
     The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all
     that comes out is a blood-curdling wail --
<b>21   EXT. BAST CAMP - NICO
</b>
     hears this horrifying cry.   He starts swiftly toward the
     hooch --
<b>22   INT. HOOCH - INTERPRETER
</b>
     has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight
     referee to two boxers. The prisoner is convulsing wildly.
     Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair.
<b>                               ZAGON
</b>                 Don't you die on me, fucker --
<b>                               FOX
</b>                        (from the side)
                 What the hell's wrong?
<b>                               ZAGON
</b>                        (throws the prisoner
                         down)
                 This pussy can't hold his liquor.

     The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm.

<b>23   NICO
</b>     enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves
     to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico,
     but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if
     he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove
     it to the others, too.

<b>24   FIRST PRISONER
</b>     dies in agony on the ground.

<b>25   SECOND PRISONER
</b>     watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties,
     scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or
     higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes
     since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough
     customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if
     daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the
     prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't
     back down an inch.
<b>                             ZAGON
</b>                      (to second prisoner)
               So my little doctor bag doesn't                      *
               scare you, eh? Well I don't need                     *
               it to open your yap.                                 *
     Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a
     fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and
     a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the
     blade in the lantern light.

<b>26   NICO
</b>     watches impassively.
<b>                             ZAGON (O.S.)
</b>                      (to prisoner)
               Where's our load, you sack of slime?
               What did you do with my shit? --
<b>27   ZAGON
</b>     punches  the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife
     handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to
     terrify  him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner
     crashes  sideways, face bloody --
<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna
               teach you never to fuck with my
               opium --

<b>28   FOX AND TWO CIT MEN
</b>
     seem to know exactly what this is about.
<b>29   NICO
</b>
     didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast.
     Nico has difficulty containing his emotion. Zagon stands
     over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up.
<b>
</b><b>                                                    6.
</b>
The prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting
Zagon's with defiance --

<b>                       ZAGON
</b>                (to prisoner)
         You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy?
         You took it from the Chinks... you took
         it from the French. You'll be fucked
         if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start
         your gums flapping --
Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the
prisoner.

<b>                       ZAGON
</b>         -- Well, you're gonna chirp for me,
         tough guy. You're gonna sing like a
         choir --

Nico takes a step toward Zagon.
<b>                       NICO
</b>         What the fuck does this have to do
         with military intelligence?
<b>                       ZAGON
</b>         Your orders are 'assist and observe'
         cherry --
Zagon turns to face Nico --

<b>                       FOX
</b>                (to Nico)
         Back off, partner --
Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner,
close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.
<b>                       ZAGON
</b>                (to second prisoner)
         I'm gonna start carving at your ankles.
         We'll throw your feet in that box right
         over there. Then I'm gonna take off
         your arms --
One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping
it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't
flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as
Zagon.
<b>                         NICO
</b>                  (can't take
                   much more)

<b>
</b><b>                                                         7.

<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               You can disappear as easy as this
               slope, kid --

     Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade.
     Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with
     terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico.
     Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a
     ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally
     comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops
     in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men
     move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing
     his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico
     out of the hooch --
<b>30   EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT
</b>
     Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --

<b>                             FOX
</b>               Are you crazy?!!
                      (as Nico jerks free)
               What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!
     Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps
     away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his
     .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the
     hooch --
<b>                            FOX
</b>               Nico!
<b>                             NICO
</b>               I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me
               later.

     The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway.
     Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --

<b>                             FOX
</b>               I'll cover this. Get back to the
<b>               L.Z. --
</b>                      (as Nico resists)
               -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the
               fuck outa here!
     The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect,
     pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to
     seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect,
     apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The
     troops, confused, hold up for a moment.

<b>                             FOX

     Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle
     trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES.
     Nico disappears into the darkness.

     TILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in
     an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks
     festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in,
     then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if
     they're late --
<b>32   INT. ST. MARY'S - DAY
</b>
     A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we
     last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife        *
     -- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the
     final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest
     straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth
     around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and
     relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in
     uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro
     with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's
     garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from
     all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm
     around Sara.                                                  *

     poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are
     everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently
     the party has come here straight from the church. Presents
     for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara,        *

     His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working-
     class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out
     subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a
     photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head.

Nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next
stool. From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          *
sawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move         *
ominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move     *
almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right
out of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash.
Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks
like his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk
shirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with
a shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the
third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening
into the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has
been put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its
feet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six.
Seven. Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat-
tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men --

      The men, led by the Bad Dude, are shifting to surround
      Nico. But no one attacks. Nico has Lucy's photo in his

      ping each one violently, spitting, raging for them to attack.

</b>A young PIMP -- quite  handsome in a boyish way -- stares up
in panic from a grimy  mattress on the floor. Little LUCY
is in bra and panties,  strung out, 14 and beautiful.
Syringes and free-base  paraphernalia are on a table.

     Nico grabs the Pimp by the scruff of the neck, lifting him
     bodily. Lucy starts wailing in horror. Nico smashes the
     Pimp's face down into a mirror with white powder on the
     table --

     and glacene bags.

     girl's life any more tragic. Besides, he's a good cop
     -- and maybe this "shipment" is on the level.

     The Zingaro family is busy preparing for the night's baking.
     Grandpa and Grandma Zingaro leave their work and receive
     their waif-like granddaughter. With eyes watering they
     thank Nico. They disappear upstairs with Lucy. Jackson,

     Nico at the wheel has just pulled away from the bakery.
     Jackson, in the passenger seat, studies her partner for a
     few moments, shaking her head at the contradictions in this
     man. Educated, classy, an elegant dresser -- yet underneath
     an out-and-out wild man.

     detainees snap them up, start munching. The girl con-
     tinues to spit curses at Nico, gesturing with her hands
     with Latin flamboyance. Nico grabs her by the elbow, as
     a jailer opens the lockup door. More curses are being
     flung at Nico from various females in the cage. Nico
     heaves Carla in among them. Carla flops down on a bench

     It's Nico's partner, Jackson, dolled up like a street-

     sags back among the women. Carla starts to cry. Jackson
     comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted.

     He crosses to the wine rack. It's dark, hard to see.
     He searches for the bottle. Suddenly: a METALLIC sound
     behind him. Nardo turns -- CHI CHI TESTAMENTE, a wiry,
     pock-faced Latino, stands in the shadows (it is clear he
     has been waiting there, hiding) -- holding a small
     silencer automatic.

     One SHOT between the eyes and Nardo CRASHES backward into
     the WINE RACK, eyes wide with shock and bewilderment. Chi
     Chi SHOOTS him AGAIN; Nardo drops like a stone. Coolly,
     professionally, Chi Chi pumps FOUR more SHOTS into the
     prone busboy's head. Chi Chi ejects the clip into his
     palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. Salvano
     appears at the top of the stairs. Two busboys are behind
     him. One of them is the young pimp. The busboys hurry        *
     down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool. *
     Salvano comes down the stairs. Chi Chi stands over his work.

     The place is packed with fashionable people of all races.
     A band plays salsa; couples dance. Nico and Jackson pass
     easily as a hip "uptown" couple. A pretty Latin HOSTESS
     approaches them.

     something to a waiter and take a seat at a rear table
     (the same "owner's table" where Salvano sat before.)
     The waiter hurries off into a back hallway.

</b>     From the back hallway Salvano emerges -- in his tux,
     looking prosperous. He sits down beside Chi Chi and
     Abandano. A waitress brings two drinks. After a few
     words, Chi Chi removes the scrap of paper from his pocket,
     hands it to Salvano.

      Luke casts an impatient glance across the street to a lot
      with four parked meat trucks. We glimpse two "truckers"
      keeping low in the shadows of one cab. Down the block a
      seemingly empty pickup truck is parked in an alley.

      talk again. He's     gagging. Salvano now points the gun at
      Chi Chi. Chi Chi     makes the decision to stop the car in
      order to save his    boss.

</b>      The engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame, wrapped
      with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the van, rips
      the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the
      shipping frame, tears them off. In the background,
      ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops
      and criminals.

</b>               Nicola! That can't be you in
               church without the family!

      Nico turns to see Father Genarro, perspiring in a baggy
      sweatshirt, a handball glove on his hand. The courtyard
      alongside the church is marked off as an athletic area.

<b>                             NICO
</b>               Father Genarro.
      The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.

<b>                             FATHER GENARRO
</b>               This must be your partner in
               crime.
                      (shakes her hand)
               I'm Father Genarro. I saw you at
               the baptismal party.
                      (with a wink to Nico)
               What a partner.

                      (smiling, but
                       impatient)
               Nico, we gotta go --
<b>                             FATHER GENARRO
</b>               No, please --
                      (more serious now)
               It's good you stopped by. I have
               to show you something. Please.
      The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps
      glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly
      driving by.
<b>153   INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY
</b>
      This is an old building. The dark corridors resemble an
      underground bunker. Old trophies and furniture are stored
      along the walls. The two cops and the priest walk.
      Another priest emerges from a door, nods, passes. Nico
      and Jackson glance in through the door as they walk.
      They reach a door with a broken handle. It looks like a
      break-in has taken place.

<b>                             FATHER GENARRO
</b>               The rats are getting bigger.

<b>                             FATHER GENARRO
</b>               Two nights ago. I didn't call

      Father Genarro knocks on the door, pauses, then knocks
      again. The door opens. A twelve-year-old who looks like
      he's from Central America stands in the doorway.

<b>                              FATHER GENARRO

                It's all right, son. These are
                friends.

      The boy steps back and we MOVE INTO --
<b>154   INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY
</b>
      A largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up.
      Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner,
      various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly
      -- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson.
      Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER
      TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again.

                These are friends.
                       (to Nico)
                This is Father Tomassino.

<b>                             FATHER TOMASSINO
</b>               How do you do?
      Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment
      between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what
      he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father
      Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave.

      for Mass. We hear an ORGAN from inside the church.

<b>158   VARIOUS ANGLES - CONGREGATION
</b>      An Italian neighborhood becoming more Hispanic. As the

      reaches over to try to help. The BABY continues FUSSING.
      Nico looks toward the priest and the front of the church.
      He notices a woman in a black shawl rise from the front
      of the church and turn, heading down one of the side
      aisles.

      She cynically smiles at Nico. Nico sees the woman in
      black pass toward the exit of the church.

<b>163   CLOSEUP - WOMAN
</b>
      It is the same woman Nico and Jackson were following with
      Abandano, the lawyer!

      The woman has left it in front of the votive candles
      directly before the priest's pulpit.

      The woman is hastily sneaking out.

</b>      Instantly he pushes his family to the floor, covering
      them with his body.

<b>168   CLOSEUP - NICO - SECOND LATER
</b>      BOOM!!!    A POWERFUL EXPLOSION erupts between the priest
      and his   congregation. Fragments of plaster, wood, and
      marble   come blasting past Nico and his family! Churchgoers
      in the   first rows are blown off their feet by the shock
      wave of   the blast. Pews overturn, smoke everywhere --
<b>169   CHOIR
</b>
      is shrieking hysterically. Stone and plaster dust rain
      down on them from the ceiling.

<b>182   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>      Nico stands, his back to the wall -- a scary, blank look

      A nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father.

           Nico storms through toward the restaurant rear. The
           employees are getting ready for the evening crowd. He
           flashes his badge, checks the kitchen, Salvano's
           office.   The man is gone.

<b>      C)   INT. MORGUE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>           Jackson has her list from the hospital.    A coroner and

           that of Alan Singletary, the man we saw   in the front     *
           row of the church. Jackson takes notes.     The dead man   *
           is definitely not the ethnic type you'd   expect in St.

<b>      D)   EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>           The same place where Nico and Jackson wire-tapped Chi

<b>190   EXT. BICEK'S BAR - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
      Nico in the alley, grilling several tough guys we saw be-
      fore when he raided this bar. The answers are all zero;
      Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated. He starts out
      the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls
      in. A jacketed LATINO MAN leans against it, an unlit ciga-
      rette in his mouth. As Nico approaches, turning toward
      his car --
<b>                                 FIRST LATINO
</b>                          (polite, casual)
                   'Cuse me, sir. Can I bum a light?
      Nico slows, eyeing the   guy dubiously. As he reaches to
      his jacket -- The side   door of the van flashes open. A
      .38 is leveled straight   at Nico's head. Instantly three
      other Latino hoods leap   to the sidewalk.
<b>                                 FIRST LATINO
</b>                          (machete under jacket)
                   Don't even think about it,
                   motherfucker.
      Machete Man (First Latino) snatches Nico's gun from its
      shoulder holster. Two hoods shove Nico back into the
      alley. Nico checks out his assailants quickly. Four of
      them. Machete, CROWBAR, BALL BAT, GUN.
<b>                                 MACHETE MAN (FIRST LATINO)
</b>                   You come to our streets... fuck
                   with our people. Now our people
                   gonna fuck with you.

      The five advance on Nico.
<b>                                 PIPE MAN
</b>                   We ain't gonna shoot you, man.
                   We gonna beat you to death. You
                   gonna learn what it means to 'get
                   down.'

<b>191   QUICK CUTS
</b>      A)   Nico is  trapped. The hoods advancing. Nico has a
           moment  of stillness, as if all senses are clicking
           out of  normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi-
           ness.   Then:
<b>
</b><b>                                                           49.
</b>
      B)   Gun and Machete Man are side by side. As Machete Man
           starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his
           wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away,
           keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun
           Man can't shoot. In a flash, Nico swings the machete,
           slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing
           the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his
           wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain
           link fence, out of reach. Nico flips Machete Man
           (who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash-
           ing, half-unconscious.
      C)   Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's
           head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of
           the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc,
           blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing
           Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes
           down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in
           pain.
      D)   Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow,
           flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail-
           ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the
           van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with
           just his head and shoulders dangling free.

      E)   Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar
           Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four,
           and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu-
           tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one
           knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third,
           machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and
           whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of
           Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re-
           mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at
           his own groin.
      F)   Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des-
           perately to regain his senses. He tries to get
           Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a-
           way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror,
           bolts.

      G)   Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to
           Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van
           window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the
           head, then tears off after Machete Man --

<b>192   EXT. STREET - DAY
</b>      Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past,
      straight into the street. A car nearly hits him, he
      vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He
      too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing --
<b>193   ANGLE DOWN BLOCK
</b>
      An all-out foot face.
<b>
</b><b>                                                             50.
</b>
      Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans.
      TWO YOUNG GIRLS, on a stoop, whistle as he passes.

<b>                             FIRST GIRL

      tears after this human cannonball.   Amazingly, he's
      gaining --
<b>195   INT. BODEGA - DAY
</b>
      Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a
      Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the
      hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes
      Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past --

<b>196   EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY
</b>      Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with
      tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard,
      which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone
      inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side --
<b>197   BACK TO NICCO
</b>      pursuing along the same route.
<b>198   MACHETE MAN
</b>
      claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame-
      work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a-
      bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked
      between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico,
      starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours.
      Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto
      the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as
      the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously.
      Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad-
      jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by
      the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by-
      fours, which give way, sending them plunging into --

<b>199   BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY
</b>      Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with
      terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man
      scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner
      next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move
      either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The
      girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.

<b>                              MACHETE MAN

Nico starts menacingly toward the hood, breathing hard
from the chase.

Nico grabs him by the hair.

<b>                             MACHETE MAN
</b>             I told ya!    No one!
Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood
doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even
louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare.
<b>                           NICO
</b>                    (shouting)
             Shut up!
The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back
to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking
the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see
that Nico can break his elbow with one blow.
<b>                          NICO
</b>                   Give it to me!
Nico raises his fist to strike.

<b>                           MACHETE MAN
</b>             Jimmy Constanza!
Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's
wallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a-
part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He
grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete
Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means.

</b>             If you're lying to me, I'll come

Nico dumps him on the ground and walks away.    Instantly
Machete Man changes his tune.

      Nico walks back, his foot smashes into the punk's face.
      He hits the ground with a thud.

      Jackson. Nico is chilled. He glances    to Sara, finger to

          I've been at the Tribune all night,
          wearing out their Xerox machine.
          Harrison's staff has been
          compiling some kind of white
          paper. He's due to release it
          next week.
Nico's mind races.

      driver's door of his car. There's a bulge in the map
      pocket. Nico  pulls out a Sig Saur .45.

<b>217   INT. DAY CARE CENTER (BEHIND CHURCH) - MORNING
</b>      OPENING CLOSE ON the faces of the sanctuary refugees.
      They are faces that have known fear and tragedy. The kind
      of faces we see on newsreels after villages have been
      burned and family members murdered. The refugees have
      been moved from church basement to a back room in the day
      care center. Nico kneels, facing them. Jackson in the
      background. A nun (SISTER BONIFACIA) and a priest (whom
      we saw in Genarro's hospital room) watch over the people.
      Nico is frustrated; he can't crack the refugees' fear.

Several of the refugees look like they want to speak, but
they are terrified.

</b>          I know there was a man here, from

The refugees become increasingly anxious.

More silence.    Glances among the people.   Finally:
<b>                          REFUGEE WOMAN
</b>          The priest.
The others shrink.   The Woman glances to them.

                 (gently)
          Father Genarro?

<b>                        REFUGEE WOMAN
</b>          The other one.

Nico looks to the American priest standing there.
<b>                       REFUGEE WOMAN
</b>          No. The young one. From Costa
          Rica.

Sister Bonifacia sighs.
<b>                        SISTER BONIFACIA
</b>          Father Tomassino.

Jackson has her pad out, taking notes. Bonifacia knows
too much has already been revealed; she must speak.
<b>
</b><b>                                                               62.

                He had papers. Papers to give to
                the senator.

      Nico tries to contain his excitement; not scare anyone by
      losing his calm.

<b>                              NICO
</b>                But the bomb... The bomb was
                planted to destroy the pulpit.
<b>                              SISTER BONIFACIA
</b>                Father Tomassino was going to

                       (shaken)
                Father Genarro talked him out of
                it.

      The refugees' faces confirm this.

                It was Father Tomassino they were
                trying to kill.

      Bonifacia starts softly to cry.    Nico puts his hand on her
      shoulder, comforting her.
<b>                              NICO
</b>                Where is Tomassino?   Where is he
                now?
      The nun shakes her head.   Nico looks to the refugees.
      They don't know, either.

<b>                              REFUGEE MAN
</b>                He run, mister. He go --

      He gestures: "who knows where?"
<b>                              NICO

                got to tell me. I want to help
                him. I can help him.
      The refugees lower their eyes. Bonifacia continues her
      soft weeping. Nico glances to Jackson; her look says
      "Enough, let's leave these poor people alone." Nico
      stands, touches Bonifacia one more time on the shoulder --

      The man lets the magazine clatter to the street. The
      others raise their hands. It takes all Nico's strength
      to keep from wasting all four of them on the spot. His
      gaze swings wildly around the intersection. He spots a
      corner grocery store. A phone inside.

      wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re-         *
      ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes
      his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men
      sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his
      eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again
      to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles
      toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men
      has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a
      second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering
      into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet.
      One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the
      freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The
      GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's
      three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into
      his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails
      into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land
      a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered
      forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --

</b>      Father Tomassino is beginning to come under the influence of
      Zagon's chemicals. In spite of this the priest's spirit to
      resist is astounding...
<b>                              ZAGON
</b>                Speak to me, Father -- who did you tell?

                beasts you are.

<b>299   EXT. ADJACENT BUILDING - ROOF OF TENEMENT
</b>      Nico and Lukich emerge from the roof door, guns drawn. The
      roof is empty. Antennas, skylights, clotheslines. The pair
      creep soundlessly onto the next roof. They cross toward the
      roof door like infantrymen, moving one at a time from cover
      to cover, covering each other. They reach the door that
      leads down into the building. Nico checks the far side of
      the enclosure, nods to Lukich. Lukich cracks the roof door
      open --

      Nico and Lukich creep down the stairs from the roof.    Nico
      opens the door leading to the top (third) floor.
<b>301   INT. APARTMENT
</b>
      The drugs have taken hold. The priest's brain is an open
      memory bank for Zagon to probe.

<b>                              ZAGON
</b>                I want to know who you told.

      Quickly Lukich checks the stairs leading down. Nico crosses
      silently past the first apartment door, checks the far end of
      the hallway. Nico comes back toward the apartment door.
      Lukich approaches from the opposite side. They take up
      positions flanking the door, guns drawn. The LOUD MUSIC
      CONTINUES from inside.
<b>304   INSIDE APARTMENT

      Salvano and Chi Chi look on, revulsed. Whatever is happening
      to Father Tomassino is enough to make even cruel men ill.

      The priest's eyes roll grotesquely; he convulses, sweat
      beading on his forehead. He looks like a man in the agonies
      of some narcotic hell.

      Nico kicks the apartment door in! He and Lukich burst in,
      guns clutched two-handed.
<b>306   QUICK CUTS
</b>
      The first goon reacts, raises his pistol. Lukich SHOOTS him.
      Nico NAILS the second goon, just as Chi Chi aims his sawed-
      off pistol-grip shotgun at Nico. Nico has a split second to
      dive behind a heavy upholstered chair. Chi Chi's DOUBLE-
      BARREL BLAST blows the chair into powder. Almost instan-
      taneously Nico sees the priest -- just as Zagon slashes the
      priest's throat! Salvano SHOOTS Lukich point blank, in the
      shoulder, sending Lukich's gun sailing. Nico, FIRING, grabs
      Lukich, dives out the door with him --

</b>
      Zagon and Salvano OPEN FIRE from the apartment full-tilt.
      BULLETS RIP through the WALL, BLASTING WOOD and PLASTER

      Nico is slamming a fresh clip in, Lukich is stumbling away
      toward the stairwell. Salvano and Chi Chi appear in the
      apartment doorway. Chi Chi levels his fierce "hogleg" at
      Nico's head. At that instant -- A broadside of BULLETS slam
      into the wall around Chi Chi. It's Jackson -- on the stairs!
      Chi Chi is hit, but spins, FIRES. His shotgun blast catches
      Jackson square in the chest, blowing her back like a doll,
      down the stairwell, out of sight. Nico reacts with agony,     *
      twists on the floor, SHOOTS Chi Chi in the face. Nico pulls
      the trigger as fast as he can, sending a HAIL of FIRE through
      the doorway, through the walls. Salvano clutches his hench-
      man, using his dead body as a shield; Nico's BULLETS blow Chi
      Chi apart. Zagon FIRES back, hits Nico in the side by the
      ribs! Nico tries to fire back; he's empty!
<b>                              ZAGON

      Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new
      clip as he goes. Salvano and Zagon burst into the hallway,
      SHOOTING at Nico.

      sideways, rolling to avoid the fire -- He recovers his
      footing in time to see Salvano and Zagon burst onto the roof
      from the stairwell. Nico's BULLETS miss them; they separate,
      taking cover behind two walls at the roof's margins. Nico
      is trapped -- in the open.

       makes his way up the street, weakening, to a tasteful brown-

       pain, exhausted, weakening --

</b>       Nico at Jackson's desk, its surface spread with the notes
       and papers she got from Senator Harrison's aide's place. We

       bodies, etc. He tries to study them, quickly, but his
       attention shifts --

       Nico glances around the apartment: more law books, Jackson's

                   work to do.

<b>                             ZAGON (O.S.)

               boy.

</b>      in a metal chair, wrists taped in front of him. One agent
      stands behind him, clasping a thin cable noose wrapped
      tight around Nico's throat. Shotgun agent holds his
      weapon on him, its twin muzzles inches from Nico's skull.

</b>
      finishes washing his hands in an industrial-type sink. He
      is cleaned up, wearing a fresh shirt, his hair combed.
      When he dries his hands, he looks like a surgeon preparing
      to operate.

<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               We've got an hour before the
               honorable senator.
                      (hands towel to
                       pistol agent)
               You've got to learn to take time,
               smell the roses.

      Zagon turns to Nico.
<b>                             NICO
</b>               How are you gonna do him, Zagon?
               In a motorcade? Or passing
               through a hotel kitchen?
      The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and
      choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a
      small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch.
      Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter-
      rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes,
      scalpels, surgical tools.

<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               I've used these little beauties
               many times to extract information --
                      (lifts a needle to
                       the light)
               -- This'll be the first time I've
               ever used them... just for fun.

      Zagon sets the syringe down, slips on a heavy, weighted
      glove.
<b>                             ZAGON
</b>                      (to agents)
               Take his arms.
      Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side,         *
      seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon
      tight to Nico's head.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          106.
</b>
      Zagon punches Nico square in the face, so hard the chair
      reels backward, spinning out from under Nico --

<b>                              ZAGON
</b>               Hold him up!
      Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him
      again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains
      from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands
      Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs
      off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico
      back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico
      looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the
      opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his
      beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes
      with defiance.

<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               This is where you came in, Toscani.
               Only, now it's where you're gonna
               check out.
      He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent
      and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon
      injects Nico.

<b>407   NICO
</b>      reacts instantly to the hypo -- cursing, sputtering under
      the choking noose. He twists wildly trying to free him-
      self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him.
<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               That's it. Fight it, cherry.
               Fight it, so it speeds faster on
               its way --
      Nico struggles more violently.

<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               Fight it. Till the vessels burst
               in your brain. Till the arteries
               rupture in your heart --

      Slowly, the struggle goes out of Nico. His muscles go
      limp; he slumps -- drooling, babbling incoherently.

<b>                             ZAGON
</b>               That's my boy. That's what I was
               waiting for --
      Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent
      and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens
      his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer,
      gloating, cooing --
<b>
</b><b>                                                          107.
</b>
<b>                              ZAGON
</b>                A fool learns from his own
                mistakes. But a wise man learns
                from the mistakes of others --
                       (moves closer, blade
                        in hand)
                You should have killed me when
                you had the chance, Toscani --

      The blade moves to Nico's throat. Suddenly: Nico springs
      to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the
      cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped
      hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him
      ferociously into the wall! Zagon drops to the floor,
      half-conscious. Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot-
      gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's
      face, about to pull the trigger. Nico sidesteps, grabbing
      the man's wrist. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by
      inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall.
      The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder
      holster. Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping
      him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon,
      spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun
      barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in!
      Another swing wipes out Pistol agent. Bad Dude, now with
      a clear shot, aims his M-16. Nico blows him away with a
      double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST. In a flash, Nico has spun
      to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp
      scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. He
      yanks the choke cable off his neck --

<b>408   ZAGON - AGAINST WALL
</b>      On his feet again. He reaches swiftly to the floor,
      snatches up his famous knife. Nico confronts him -- face
      battered, bloody -- shaking, battling internal spasms.
<b>                              ZAGON
</b>                Can you feel the chemicals,
                cherry? You can't fight 'em much
                longer --
<b>                              NICO
</b>                Long enough to finish you.
      Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an
      animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon
      in the face with one lightning blow. We see Zagon's nose
      and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's
      elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in
      a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against
      the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is
      screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs
      have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes
      are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of
      strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle
      free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken-
      ing sound.

       As the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up
       around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with
       one arm. He begins to now do to Zagon's neck what he did
       to his arm. We hear a terminal CRACK. Zagon's body
       crumples to the floor. Nico, in delirium, staggers
       toward the door --

      inside. The senator is now leaving.

      Total confusion. Guests staring everywhere. From a side
