    CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and,     *
    oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny

<b>    KARAOKE STAGE
</b>
    in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar.

    Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke
    version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent
    she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm.

    At a table near the stage is --

    -- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      *
    handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps
    and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with --

    -- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       *
    who sings along with --

    -- the small but energetic CROWD.

    Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points
    to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the
    Queen of Karaoke.

Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to
join Charlie and Owen.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          That was so good, baby!

</b>          Bullshit.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          I'm serious. You sing like an angel
          -- a drunk angel.

Owen and Kate LAUGH.

</b>          That would be such a shitty article

Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at
Owen and makes a puppy dog face.

Owen motions to the --

          I'll take point -- follow me.

Kate stumbles to the bar. Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts
her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender.

</b>          Wait -- don't you wanna know what
          happened to him?

The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see
if there are other customers. It's pretty dead -- so she
listens.

          Court...that was her name. He loved
          her so much that he went with her
          because she had a fellowship or
          something. He gave up being a
          kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               *

The bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation
to hear her response, which is --

<b>                    FEMALE BARTENDER
</b>              (to Owen)

          Yeah.

And...that's all Owen's got.

<b>                    KATE
</b>              (jumping in)
          And he teaches kids at the
          kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so
          cute!

The bartender glances back to Owen.

</b>              (finally)
          A lot of `em don't have parents --
          so...it's kinda more than just a
          teacher/student thing.
              (beat)
          I know it sounds silly, but I feel
          responsible for them -- like...
              (emotional)
          ...I could be their parent.

Kate slides down the bar to Charlie.

</b>          Sure she just didn't want to get
          into your pants?

Kate rolls her eyes.

</b>          I think I'm done for the night.

          harder.
              (to Kate)
          Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen
          should take us home -- you're too
          drunk to drive.

<b>                     KATE
</b>          So's Owen.
              (suddenly focused)
          I'm not that drunk. Besides, you
          know I focus when I drive -- it
          sobers me up.

              I love you, baby. I'll be waiting
              for you in a nice warm bed. You
              have exactly one mission: get your
              brother laid -- and don't talk to
              any other women.

    Beat.

<b>                        CHARLIE
</b>              That sounds like two missions.

<b>                        KATE
</b>              No, it's just one.

<b>                        CHARLIE

    Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances
    over and sees:

    A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS

              ...'cause I feel like I understand
              what it's like to be homeless, ya
              know? I mean, if you didn't know
              me, if we hadn't connected tonight,

              upper-middle-class, NPR listening,
              self-congratulatory, insulated,
              lazy liberal bitch. Probably never
              had to worry about anything." But
              that's not true at all! I grew up
              poor, man. Single mother.
              McDonald's used to have one day a
              week where they sold 29 cent
              hamburgers, and another day where
              they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My
              mom and me would go there and she'd
              get twenty burgers -- that was the
              limit, probably set up for folks
              just like us -- and then she'd put
              `em in the freezer and we'd
              microwave `em for dinner throughout
              the week.

               it was like, "If you answered `yes'
               to any of these you're an
               alcoholic!"

     Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards
     Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away.
     Kate chases after him.

     An AA meeting is in progress.

     An OLDER WOMAN stands at the podium sharing her story.

The room is filled with --

-- different groups of PEOPLE, all of whom sit with their
"own group," like a high school lunch room -- but the people
are adults. There are distinct groups of --

<b>-- "PRETTY WOMEN" --
</b>
<b>-- "OBSESSIVELY TATTOOED PEOPLE" --
</b>
<b>-- "BUSINESSMEN" --
</b>
-- and "HIPSTERS."

As Kate -- who's slightly confused -- enters the building, a
hip looking man -- DONOVAN, 30's -- stops her, extending his
hand.

<b>                    DONOVAN
</b>              (whispers)

Donovan "shushes" Kate.

<b>                    DONOVAN
</b>              (whispers)
          Um, I'm not really allowed to talk
          to new chicks, but there are lots
          of women here who can help you out.

<b>                    DONOVAN

          try to find a spot anywhere.

Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying
things like "sorry" and "I like that jacket" as she takes a
seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN.

As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next
to Kate quietly try to welcome her.

          You're home.

Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear
anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally
joined Jim Jones' church.

<b>LATER
</b>
The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE.

The tattooed man stands at the podium.

<b>                    TATTOO MAN

          that we may get to know you better -
          - is there anybody here in their

Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and
introduce themselves as alcoholics.

Kate stands up.

<b>                    KATE
</b>          I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a

People burst into LAUGHTER.

          a drink or any mind-altering

          start. She's, like, stuck in the
          80's and kind of a metalhead. Her
          last boyfriend called himself a
          drummer but really just gave drum

          mean, I don't want to say you guys
          are wrong or anything...

Kate nervously LAUGHS.

Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate.

<b>                    TATTOO MAN
</b>          Thank you -- we're all here to
          help. We do have to move on,

A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium.

Kate seems surprised at being chastised.

</b>              (gaining intensity)
          Um...okay? It's because I did the
          work. I got down on my knees and

The whole room APPLAUDS.

Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY

              (beat)
          I think the break is just about
          over. This meeting is the kind
          where everyone can share. Sharing
          always helps me, so...if it's not

          yourself and telling the group
          what's going on.

               don't really know. I drink -- a
               lot. I've always drank. Everyone I
               know drinks a lot. I never really
               thought I had a problem -- lately
               though it seems like maybe I do. I

               shit that I used to laugh off isn't
               really funny anymore. The dumb
               drunk stuff has gone from

          But this place gets a little nuts
          after sundown and I don't think a

She begins to weep.

Kate gets a flash of anger again and just as it seems like
she's about to hit Charlie with the bottle, she --

-- upturns the bottle and begins to chug the tequila.

Charlie tries to yank the bottle away, but Kate holds on
tight. With the bottle at Kate's lips -- and tequila pouring
down her chin -- the couple wrestles for control of the
bottle.

          My marriage fell apart. I got fired

          off."

          I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE
          those slogans. They all sound like
          bumper stickers. But, I have to
          admit...for me, that last one is
          pretty damn true.

          When I drink...I become another
          person. And that person is a pretty
          big asshole. Well, unless you want
          to give me drugs or buy me drinks --
          then that person is awesome.

<b>                         KATE
</b>               I don't care if you drink a beer.

<b>                            CHARLIE
</b>               You sure?

<b>                         KATE
</b>               Yeah. Whatever.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>                   (thinks about it)
               No...I'm good.

<b>     LATER
</b>
     Kate stands by the stove and watches as --

     -- Charlie -- who sits at the kitchen table -- wolfs down the
     bacon and egg sandwich.

     Kate seems pleased that Charlie enjoys it so much.

     Kate and Charlie play croquet.                                  *

They look a little tired -- like they've been playing a
while. Kate seems to be much better than Charlie.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>             Have you been playing a lot?

<b>                       KATE
</b>             I haven't played in over a year.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>             Then how're you beating me?

<b>                       KATE
</b>             I don't know. Innate talent?

They keep playing.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>             I haven't met anyone even vaguely
             interesting since we separated.

<b>                       KATE
</b>             Um...stick to the game, okay?

Long beat.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>             I've been masturbating like crazy.

<b>                          KATE
</b>             Charlie --

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>             I miss you.

<b>                          KATE
</b>             Stop it.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>             Okay. Fine.

Beat.

<b>                       KATE
</b>             You could've been killed.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>                 (confused)
             What?

<b>                       KATE
</b>             Riding your bike -- drunk.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          But I wasn't.

<b>                    KATE
</b>          But is that really the point?

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          What are trying to say?

<b>                     KATE
</b>              (beat)
          I worry about you.

<b>                     CHARLIE
</b>              (laughs)
          Yeah, I can understand that. I used
          to worry about you. But now I know
          you're okay.
              (beat)
          That makes me happy...I mean, it
          fucking sucks that you're better
          off without me but I'm glad you're
          doing well.

No reply from Kate.

<b>                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Would you move back in if I came to
          meetings?

<b>                    KATE
</b>          You should go for yourself, not to
          make me happy.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          But, would you?

<b>                    KATE
</b>          I'm not moving back in.

That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear.

<b>                     KATE (CONT'D)
</b>          Listen, I should go. It's gonna get
          dark soon.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          We can always turn the lights on.

<b>                    KATE
</b>          I don't know...

Beat.
<b>                                                         108.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          So, would you at least...let me
          take you out on a date?

Kate says nothing.

<b>                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Maybe...?

Kate shakes her head.

Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined.

<b>                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay...fine. 0 for 2.
              (new direction)
          Last question: can we just...play
          one more game?

Kate doesn't answer.

<b>                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>          C'mon...you keep kicking my ass.
          It's embarrassing. You've gotta
          give me a chance to redeem myself.
              (soft)
          Please.

Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes...

...but she also doesn't say no.

There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes.
