21/11/2014:

- MovieModel.py can now load a database from disk and be trained and tested on it.
- Lowered the initial noise on the weights of MovieModel so that the output doesn't saturate.
- MakeDatabase.pl now makes use of the Porter's stemmer, since otherwise the number of language features generated becomes too high (~65K without it).

20/11/2014:

- Added script MakeDatabase.pl, which also contains the previous FeaturesCrawler.pl.
- Added a very simple database with just movie scores and simple script features.

17/11/2014:

- Added a fully functional neural network to model the problem.
- Added a movie script parser as well as 724 movie scripts downloaded from IMSDb using it.

10/11/2014:

- Added two scripts to crawl the IMDb website:
    - "movie_url_crawler.pl" gets the URLs of movies and stores it within the "movies.txt" file, taking care not to include duplicates.
    - "movie_content_crawler.pl" takes URLs from "movies.txt" and crawls their information from IMDb, storing it within "database.csv" in a tabular-spaced format. Currently, the following fields are stored:
        - Title
        - Year
        - IMDb score
        - Parental rating
        - Director
        - Main stars
        - Summary
