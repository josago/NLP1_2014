- Added two scripts to crawl the IMDb website:
    - "movie_url_crawler.pl" gets the URLs of movies and stores it within the "movies.txt" file, taking care not to include duplicates.
    - "movie_content_crawler.pl" takes URLs from "movies.txt" and crawls their information from IMDb, storing it within "database.csv" in a tabular-spaced format. Currently, the following fields are stored:
        - Title
        - Year
        - IMDb score
        - Parental rating
        - Director
        - Main stars
        - Summary
